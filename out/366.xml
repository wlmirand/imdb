    Louanne Johnson is an ex-marine, hired as a teacher in a high-school in a poor area of the city. She has recently separated from her husband. Her friend, also teacher in the school, got the temporary job for her. After a terrible reception from the students, she tries unconventional methods of teaching (using karate, Bob Dylan lyrics etc) to gain the trust of the students. And guess what? it works!! In a non-patronising way to the audience.. It's been sixteen years since this film was released here in England, and it was a movie I always resisted in seeing. Mainly because it got so much coverage thanks to that awful song, but it never really appealed to me. Seeing it for the first time last week, I now know why. It's a pitiful movie, cashing in on success of Boyz n the Hood, and high school movies, but with the Bruckheimer and Simpson sheen. It just doesn't work. For one thing the class look almost as old as Pfeiffer, and they warm to her way too soon. Secondl, she goes out of her way to look after these 'kids'. it's as if Edward James Olmos and Morgan Freeman are giving her motivation throughout. Pfeiffer is trying to down play her beauty, wearing a leather jacket and eating junk in every scene, but she doesn't convince. There is nothing new to see, it's just another bad class with hearts of gold movie, and they are tiresome. See 187 instead, that is a movie.

    I wish I had never watched it. Nothing from this movie came out original. Having watched a bunch of "inspirational teacher movies" this one came out lame. The teacher was rather annoying and nosy rather that truly caring and genuine. She was an ex-marine? She didn't look the part and didn't show any sign that she was ever under the rigid and disciplined Marine training. It would have been good if she used some Marine techniques in disciplining her students instead of using Bob Dylan poems to inspire her students. What was the point of making a weak copy cat of "To Sir With Love?" This movie is a sad one. A really sad movie as it should never have been made.

    One reviewer said "unless you lived the life," and others said what they thought, and yet it got a total of 6 among 72 voices. I'm giving it an 8 and I believe it reverberated as "true" and "truth" with one exception: teachers often love their students and give them candy, but the likelihood of a teacher overcoming the system is nil; hence the story portrays truth among students and teacher, but totally fails to address how a teacher who cares, and cares as much as this one did, overcame the bureaucracy and went on teaching. The performances were great across the board and a movie worth seeing more than once.

    wow! i have to say this was a great movie, awesome characters and storyline. the saddest part of it was when Emilio Ramirez was killed, no one was expecting that. What made it even more sad was that the actor who portrayed him, Wade Dominguez died in real life on August 26 1998. i couldn't believe it at first when i read about this, he was so charismatic, handsome, charming and great actor. Although he is gone he will never be forgotten and will always be loved for what a wonderful person he was! Today makes it 13 years since he passed, its just so hard to believe its that long already but hopefully his movies leaves us a legacy! LOVE YOU WADE!!! RIP May 10.1966-August 26, 1998 XOXO

    Plot: A teacher gets a job in a certain high school and hopelessly tries to help a class full of poor students do something with their lives, while they try to survive the streets they were born onto. You'll love Dangerous Minds if: You don't ask too much out of a movie like this and of course if you like Michelle Pfeiffer it's a movie about a teacher that struggles to teach students that come from broken homes and that are more streetwise than she can handle. You might cry with the lives of the kids and you might get angry with the indifference of the teachers but don't expect too much. While not a fan of Michelle I gotta agree that see does a good job in here although her character is a bit TOO sensitive for an ex-marine. You'll hate Dangerous Minds if: You want realism or if you hate soap operas. That's right soap operas. Dangerous Minds feels like a long episode of a soap opera. Logic and realism are almost non-existent. The first day the teacher enters the class the students almost ate her and some days later they were all behaving themselves, answering vocabulary questions while the teacher was throwing candy bars at them, ("good boy!!!", "Woof!"). The movie's concept is good, the execution is the problem. The kids will make you feel sad about their desperate struggle to cope up with their lives but the way the teacher connects with them leaves something to be desired FINAL VERDICT: Won't Change Your Life (3.7/10) [+] Decent acting. You might shed a tear at times. [-] Good concept, bad execution. Not as dark as it should be in my opinion. Too much like a soap opera episode. Also Check: Dead Poets Society (1989)  Good Will Hunting (1997) - Stand And Deliver  Up The Down Staircase (1967) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I've enjoyed dramas about teachers who help their students make a difference, such as 'Lean on Me', 'Freedom Writers', and 'One Eight Seven', but this is hardly one of them. The teacher doesn't come close to being remotely strict, and the students don't seem particularly indifferent. The movie isn't so much about ethics as it is about getting inside the heads of these people. There's nothing at stake here. The amusement park and restaurant scenes aren't earned, and aren't necessary. Movies like this don't have to be conventional, but they should mean something. The parts of the film that do work, are when Pfeiffer's character is interacting with the other adults. The relationship between her and the students didn't work for me. **1/2 out of ****

    This film could not have been any worse if they tried. We have seen these types of films before when a teacher or principle goes into a school that is filled with tough kids and by the end they all love the teacher. Dangerous Minds may be based on a true story but it is not an original idea and certainly not worthy of being made into a movie. OK so a teacher by the name of Louanne Johnson played by Michelle Pfeiffer inspires kids to learn and love poetry by having them listen to Bob Dylan songs. Big deal. Think of all the great teachers out there that reached trouble kids by some creative means. What about their story's? Aside from that Michelle Pfeiffer is mis-cast as some ex-Marine. She does not pull off the part and is less than convincing. The film makers also are deceptive in their telling the story of Louanne Johnson. She never used Bob Dlyan songs to teach her class but rather rap music. I guess the film makers felt rap might offend the audience. Do a little research on this teacher and see for yourself. A very bad film...

    Cheesy Cringe-worthy Punch-in-the-face-worthy soppy acting from Michelle Pfeiffer Stereotypes blown totally out of proportion Poor camera work Diabolical musical overlay Badly scripted Rushed feel No real closure I cannot criticise this movie enough. While I was expecting a typically dark gangster/student-type movie, addressing the inner-city problems of troubled kids in poverty-stricken areas, and the interesting, inspiring attempts of an admirable teacher to get to the bottom of their various dysfunctions, what I instead got was something so cheesy it would have been better suited to Broadway, if they threw in some hastily written musical numbers. For something (slightly) more realistic, see Coach Carter, but please, please, don't waste the 1 hr 30 mins I did on Dangerous Minds, the mis-titled waste of film roll that it is.

    The title suggested something like a crime/gangster film to me, and of course the song in the opening sequence is a bit of an odd choice, but it was still a good film. Based on a true story, the story sees ex-marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) hired as a teacher at Parkmont High School, for a class of street-wise teens, involved with gangs and drugs. The first day Louanne gives up pretty quickly, but by the second she is determined to get through and try to teach them English, i.e. poetry, but she is using very unconventional methods to do so. Even though she is questioned by the head and stuff, it does seem to be working, and the students are beginning to trust and respect her, and get on with the work. It is only when a student is shot and killed that this ends, and overwhelmed with guilt, Louanne wants to quit her job, and the students are insisting she stays, but in the end, she still left. Also starring George Dzundza as Hal Griffith, Courtney B. Vance as George Grandey, Robin Bartlett as Carla Nichols, Bruklin Harris as Callie Roberts, Renoly Santiago as Raul Sanchero, Wade Dominguez as Emilio Ramirez, Beatrice Winde as Mary Benton and Lorraine Toussaint as Irene Roberts. I think one of the main reasons I knew about this film, besides the performance Pfeiffer, was it featured the song "Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio, so I guess there is a little relevance, but the title isn't very obvious, I guess I'm glad I watched it. Worth watching!

    I don't care if this type of movie has been done "a million times" I understand it is from a real life experience. It showcases an exceptional teacher doing the MOST difficult task - actually teaching our youth. What makes it even more interesting is that the young students are just short of being thrown away by the very people who excepted the responsibility of guiding them. I would be happy to watch one a day if they were all based on real teachers doing their job enthusiastically and when necessary beating the "powers that be" back with a stick! It should warm the hearts of parents to know that there really are teachers like that out there. Not to mention serving as a wake up call to current teachers, who have forgotten why they trained for this profession, to get back in the game. I'd say, tried and true, it was tried and it is so true!

What was the point of making a weak copy cat of "To Sir With Love?" This movie is a sad one. A really sad movie as it should never have been made.

    One reviewer said "unless you lived the life," and others said what they thought, and yet it got a total of 6 among 72 voices. I'm giving it an 8 and I believe it reverberated as "true" and "truth" with one exception: teachers often love their students and give them candy, but the likelihood of a teacher overcoming the system is nil; hence the story portrays truth among students and teacher, but totally fails to address how a teacher who cares, and cares as much as this one did, overcame the bureaucracy and went on teaching. The performances were great across the board and a movie worth seeing more than once.

    wow! i have to say this was a great movie, awesome characters and storyline. the saddest part of it was when Emilio Ramirez was killed, no one was expecting that. What made it even more sad was that the actor who portrayed him, Wade Dominguez died in real life on August 26 1998. i couldn't believe it at first when i read about this, he was so charismatic, handsome, charming and great actor. Although he is gone he will never be forgotten and will always be loved for what a wonderful person he was! Today makes it 13 years since he passed, its just so hard to believe its that long already but hopefully his movies leaves us a legacy! LOVE YOU WADE!!! RIP May 10.1966-August 26, 1998 XOXO

    Plot: A teacher gets a job in a certain high school and hopelessly tries to help a class full of poor students do something with their lives, while they try to survive the streets they were born onto. You'll love Dangerous Minds if: You don't ask too much out of a movie like this and of course if you like Michelle Pfeiffer it's a movie about a teacher that struggles to teach students that come from broken homes and that are more streetwise than she can handle. You might cry with the lives of the kids and you might get angry with the indifference of the teachers but don't expect too much. While not a fan of Michelle I gotta agree that see does a good job in here although her character is a bit TOO sensitive for an ex-marine. You'll hate Dangerous Minds if: You want realism or if you hate soap operas. That's right soap operas. Dangerous Minds feels like a long episode of a soap opera. Logic and realism are almost non-existent. The first day the teacher enters the class the students almost ate her and some days later they were all behaving themselves, answering vocabulary questions while the teacher was throwing candy bars at them, ("good boy!!!", "Woof!"). The movie's concept is good, the execution is the problem. The kids will make you feel sad about their desperate struggle to cope up with their lives but the way the teacher connects with them leaves something to be desired FINAL VERDICT: Won't Change Your Life (3.7/10) [+] Decent acting. You might shed a tear at times. [-] Good concept, bad execution. Not as dark as it should be in my opinion. Too much like a soap opera episode. Also Check: Dead Poets Society (1989)  Good Will Hunting (1997) - Stand And Deliver  Up The Down Staircase (1967) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I've enjoyed dramas about teachers who help their students make a difference, such as 'Lean on Me', 'Freedom Writers', and 'One Eight Seven', but this is hardly one of them. The teacher doesn't come close to being remotely strict, and the students don't seem particularly indifferent. The movie isn't so much about ethics as it is about getting inside the heads of these people. There's nothing at stake here. The amusement park and restaurant scenes aren't earned, and aren't necessary. Movies like this don't have to be conventional, but they should mean something. The parts of the film that do work, are when Pfeiffer's character is interacting with the other adults. The relationship between her and the students didn't work for me. **1/2 out of ****

    This film could not have been any worse if they tried. We have seen these types of films before when a teacher or principle goes into a school that is filled with tough kids and by the end they all love the teacher. Dangerous Minds may be based on a true story but it is not an original idea and certainly not worthy of being made into a movie. OK so a teacher by the name of Louanne Johnson played by Michelle Pfeiffer inspires kids to learn and love poetry by having them listen to Bob Dylan songs. Big deal. Think of all the great teachers out there that reached trouble kids by some creative means. What about their story's? Aside from that Michelle Pfeiffer is mis-cast as some ex-Marine. She does not pull off the part and is less than convincing. The film makers also are deceptive in their telling the story of Louanne Johnson. She never used Bob Dlyan songs to teach her class but rather rap music. I guess the film makers felt rap might offend the audience. Do a little research on this teacher and see for yourself. A very bad film...

    Cheesy Cringe-worthy Punch-in-the-face-worthy soppy acting from Michelle Pfeiffer Stereotypes blown totally out of proportion Poor camera work Diabolical musical overlay Badly scripted Rushed feel No real closure I cannot criticise this movie enough. While I was expecting a typically dark gangster/student-type movie, addressing the inner-city problems of troubled kids in poverty-stricken areas, and the interesting, inspiring attempts of an admirable teacher to get to the bottom of their various dysfunctions, what I instead got was something so cheesy it would have been better suited to Broadway, if they threw in some hastily written musical numbers. For something (slightly) more realistic, see Coach Carter, but please, please, don't waste the 1 hr 30 mins I did on Dangerous Minds, the mis-titled waste of film roll that it is.

    The title suggested something like a crime/gangster film to me, and of course the song in the opening sequence is a bit of an odd choice, but it was still a good film. Based on a true story, the story sees ex-marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) hired as a teacher at Parkmont High School, for a class of street-wise teens, involved with gangs and drugs. The first day Louanne gives up pretty quickly, but by the second she is determined to get through and try to teach them English, i.e. poetry, but she is using very unconventional methods to do so. Even though she is questioned by the head and stuff, it does seem to be working, and the students are beginning to trust and respect her, and get on with the work. It is only when a student is shot and killed that this ends, and overwhelmed with guilt, Louanne wants to quit her job, and the students are insisting she stays, but in the end, she still left. Also starring George Dzundza as Hal Griffith, Courtney B. Vance as George Grandey, Robin Bartlett as Carla Nichols, Bruklin Harris as Callie Roberts, Renoly Santiago as Raul Sanchero, Wade Dominguez as Emilio Ramirez, Beatrice Winde as Mary Benton and Lorraine Toussaint as Irene Roberts. I think one of the main reasons I knew about this film, besides the performance Pfeiffer, was it featured the song "Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio, so I guess there is a little relevance, but the title isn't very obvious, I guess I'm glad I watched it. Worth watching!

    I don't care if this type of movie has been done "a million times" I understand it is from a real life experience. It showcases an exceptional teacher doing the MOST difficult task - actually teaching our youth. What makes it even more interesting is that the young students are just short of being thrown away by the very people who excepted the responsibility of guiding them. I would be happy to watch one a day if they were all based on real teachers doing their job enthusiastically and when necessary beating the "powers that be" back with a stick! It should warm the hearts of parents to know that there really are teachers like that out there. Not to mention serving as a wake up call to current teachers, who have forgotten why they trained for this profession, to get back in the game. I'd say, tried and true, it was tried and it is so true!

    Louanne Johnson is an ex-marine, hired as a teacher in a high-school in a poor area of the city. She has recently separated from her husband. Her friend, also teacher in the school, got the temporary job for her. After a terrible reception from the students, she tries unconventional methods of teaching (using karate, Bob Dylan lyrics etc) to gain the trust of the students. And guess what? it works!! In a non-patronising way to the audience.. It's been sixteen years since this film was released here in England, and it was a movie I always resisted in seeing. Mainly because it got so much coverage thanks to that awful song, but it never really appealed to me. Seeing it for the first time last week, I now know why. It's a pitiful movie, cashing in on success of Boyz n the Hood, and high school movies, but with the Bruckheimer and Simpson sheen. It just doesn't work. For one thing the class look almost as old as Pfeiffer, and they warm to her way too soon. Secondl, she goes out of her way to look after these 'kids'. it's as if Edward James Olmos and Morgan Freeman are giving her motivation throughout. Pfeiffer is trying to down play her beauty, wearing a leather jacket and eating junk in every scene, but she doesn't convince. There is nothing new to see, it's just another bad class with hearts of gold movie, and they are tiresome. See 187 instead, that is a movie.

    I wish I had never watched it. Nothing from this movie came out original. Having watched a bunch of "inspirational teacher movies" this one came out lame. The teacher was rather annoying and nosy rather that truly caring and genuine. She was an ex-marine? She didn't look the part and didn't show any sign that she was ever under the rigid and disciplined Marine training. It would have been good if she used some Marine techniques in disciplining her students instead of using Bob Dylan poems to inspire her students.

Also Check: Dead Poets Society (1989)  Good Will Hunting (1997) - Stand And Deliver  Up The Down Staircase (1967) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I've enjoyed dramas about teachers who help their students make a difference, such as 'Lean on Me', 'Freedom Writers', and 'One Eight Seven', but this is hardly one of them. The teacher doesn't come close to being remotely strict, and the students don't seem particularly indifferent. The movie isn't so much about ethics as it is about getting inside the heads of these people. There's nothing at stake here. The amusement park and restaurant scenes aren't earned, and aren't necessary. Movies like this don't have to be conventional, but they should mean something. The parts of the film that do work, are when Pfeiffer's character is interacting with the other adults. The relationship between her and the students didn't work for me. **1/2 out of ****

    This film could not have been any worse if they tried. We have seen these types of films before when a teacher or principle goes into a school that is filled with tough kids and by the end they all love the teacher. Dangerous Minds may be based on a true story but it is not an original idea and certainly not worthy of being made into a movie. OK so a teacher by the name of Louanne Johnson played by Michelle Pfeiffer inspires kids to learn and love poetry by having them listen to Bob Dylan songs. Big deal. Think of all the great teachers out there that reached trouble kids by some creative means. What about their story's? Aside from that Michelle Pfeiffer is mis-cast as some ex-Marine. She does not pull off the part and is less than convincing. The film makers also are deceptive in their telling the story of Louanne Johnson. She never used Bob Dlyan songs to teach her class but rather rap music. I guess the film makers felt rap might offend the audience. Do a little research on this teacher and see for yourself. A very bad film...

    Cheesy Cringe-worthy Punch-in-the-face-worthy soppy acting from Michelle Pfeiffer Stereotypes blown totally out of proportion Poor camera work Diabolical musical overlay Badly scripted Rushed feel No real closure I cannot criticise this movie enough. While I was expecting a typically dark gangster/student-type movie, addressing the inner-city problems of troubled kids in poverty-stricken areas, and the interesting, inspiring attempts of an admirable teacher to get to the bottom of their various dysfunctions, what I instead got was something so cheesy it would have been better suited to Broadway, if they threw in some hastily written musical numbers. For something (slightly) more realistic, see Coach Carter, but please, please, don't waste the 1 hr 30 mins I did on Dangerous Minds, the mis-titled waste of film roll that it is.

    The title suggested something like a crime/gangster film to me, and of course the song in the opening sequence is a bit of an odd choice, but it was still a good film. Based on a true story, the story sees ex-marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) hired as a teacher at Parkmont High School, for a class of street-wise teens, involved with gangs and drugs. The first day Louanne gives up pretty quickly, but by the second she is determined to get through and try to teach them English, i.e. poetry, but she is using very unconventional methods to do so. Even though she is questioned by the head and stuff, it does seem to be working, and the students are beginning to trust and respect her, and get on with the work. It is only when a student is shot and killed that this ends, and overwhelmed with guilt, Louanne wants to quit her job, and the students are insisting she stays, but in the end, she still left. Also starring George Dzundza as Hal Griffith, Courtney B. Vance as George Grandey, Robin Bartlett as Carla Nichols, Bruklin Harris as Callie Roberts, Renoly Santiago as Raul Sanchero, Wade Dominguez as Emilio Ramirez, Beatrice Winde as Mary Benton and Lorraine Toussaint as Irene Roberts. I think one of the main reasons I knew about this film, besides the performance Pfeiffer, was it featured the song "Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio, so I guess there is a little relevance, but the title isn't very obvious, I guess I'm glad I watched it. Worth watching!

    I don't care if this type of movie has been done "a million times" I understand it is from a real life experience. It showcases an exceptional teacher doing the MOST difficult task - actually teaching our youth. What makes it even more interesting is that the young students are just short of being thrown away by the very people who excepted the responsibility of guiding them. I would be happy to watch one a day if they were all based on real teachers doing their job enthusiastically and when necessary beating the "powers that be" back with a stick! It should warm the hearts of parents to know that there really are teachers like that out there. Not to mention serving as a wake up call to current teachers, who have forgotten why they trained for this profession, to get back in the game. I'd say, tried and true, it was tried and it is so true!

    Louanne Johnson is an ex-marine, hired as a teacher in a high-school in a poor area of the city. She has recently separated from her husband. Her friend, also teacher in the school, got the temporary job for her. After a terrible reception from the students, she tries unconventional methods of teaching (using karate, Bob Dylan lyrics etc) to gain the trust of the students. And guess what? it works!! In a non-patronising way to the audience.. It's been sixteen years since this film was released here in England, and it was a movie I always resisted in seeing. Mainly because it got so much coverage thanks to that awful song, but it never really appealed to me. Seeing it for the first time last week, I now know why. It's a pitiful movie, cashing in on success of Boyz n the Hood, and high school movies, but with the Bruckheimer and Simpson sheen. It just doesn't work. For one thing the class look almost as old as Pfeiffer, and they warm to her way too soon. Secondl, she goes out of her way to look after these 'kids'. it's as if Edward James Olmos and Morgan Freeman are giving her motivation throughout. Pfeiffer is trying to down play her beauty, wearing a leather jacket and eating junk in every scene, but she doesn't convince. There is nothing new to see, it's just another bad class with hearts of gold movie, and they are tiresome. See 187 instead, that is a movie.

    I wish I had never watched it. Nothing from this movie came out original. Having watched a bunch of "inspirational teacher movies" this one came out lame. The teacher was rather annoying and nosy rather that truly caring and genuine. She was an ex-marine? She didn't look the part and didn't show any sign that she was ever under the rigid and disciplined Marine training. It would have been good if she used some Marine techniques in disciplining her students instead of using Bob Dylan poems to inspire her students. What was the point of making a weak copy cat of "To Sir With Love?" This movie is a sad one. A really sad movie as it should never have been made.

    One reviewer said "unless you lived the life," and others said what they thought, and yet it got a total of 6 among 72 voices. I'm giving it an 8 and I believe it reverberated as "true" and "truth" with one exception: teachers often love their students and give them candy, but the likelihood of a teacher overcoming the system is nil; hence the story portrays truth among students and teacher, but totally fails to address how a teacher who cares, and cares as much as this one did, overcame the bureaucracy and went on teaching. The performances were great across the board and a movie worth seeing more than once.

    wow! i have to say this was a great movie, awesome characters and storyline. the saddest part of it was when Emilio Ramirez was killed, no one was expecting that. What made it even more sad was that the actor who portrayed him, Wade Dominguez died in real life on August 26 1998. i couldn't believe it at first when i read about this, he was so charismatic, handsome, charming and great actor. Although he is gone he will never be forgotten and will always be loved for what a wonderful person he was! Today makes it 13 years since he passed, its just so hard to believe its that long already but hopefully his movies leaves us a legacy! LOVE YOU WADE!!! RIP May 10.1966-August 26, 1998 XOXO

    Plot: A teacher gets a job in a certain high school and hopelessly tries to help a class full of poor students do something with their lives, while they try to survive the streets they were born onto. You'll love Dangerous Minds if: You don't ask too much out of a movie like this and of course if you like Michelle Pfeiffer it's a movie about a teacher that struggles to teach students that come from broken homes and that are more streetwise than she can handle. You might cry with the lives of the kids and you might get angry with the indifference of the teachers but don't expect too much. While not a fan of Michelle I gotta agree that see does a good job in here although her character is a bit TOO sensitive for an ex-marine. You'll hate Dangerous Minds if: You want realism or if you hate soap operas. That's right soap operas. Dangerous Minds feels like a long episode of a soap opera. Logic and realism are almost non-existent. The first day the teacher enters the class the students almost ate her and some days later they were all behaving themselves, answering vocabulary questions while the teacher was throwing candy bars at them, ("good boy!!!", "Woof!"). The movie's concept is good, the execution is the problem. The kids will make you feel sad about their desperate struggle to cope up with their lives but the way the teacher connects with them leaves something to be desired FINAL VERDICT: Won't Change Your Life (3.7/10) [+] Decent acting.

    The title suggested something like a crime/gangster film to me, and of course the song in the opening sequence is a bit of an odd choice, but it was still a good film. Based on a true story, the story sees ex-marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) hired as a teacher at Parkmont High School, for a class of street-wise teens, involved with gangs and drugs. The first day Louanne gives up pretty quickly, but by the second she is determined to get through and try to teach them English, i.e. poetry, but she is using very unconventional methods to do so. Even though she is questioned by the head and stuff, it does seem to be working, and the students are beginning to trust and respect her, and get on with the work. It is only when a student is shot and killed that this ends, and overwhelmed with guilt, Louanne wants to quit her job, and the students are insisting she stays, but in the end, she still left. Also starring George Dzundza as Hal Griffith, Courtney B. Vance as George Grandey, Robin Bartlett as Carla Nichols, Bruklin Harris as Callie Roberts, Renoly Santiago as Raul Sanchero, Wade Dominguez as Emilio Ramirez, Beatrice Winde as Mary Benton and Lorraine Toussaint as Irene Roberts. I think one of the main reasons I knew about this film, besides the performance Pfeiffer, was it featured the song "Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio, so I guess there is a little relevance, but the title isn't very obvious, I guess I'm glad I watched it. Worth watching!

    I don't care if this type of movie has been done "a million times" I understand it is from a real life experience. It showcases an exceptional teacher doing the MOST difficult task - actually teaching our youth. What makes it even more interesting is that the young students are just short of being thrown away by the very people who excepted the responsibility of guiding them. I would be happy to watch one a day if they were all based on real teachers doing their job enthusiastically and when necessary beating the "powers that be" back with a stick! It should warm the hearts of parents to know that there really are teachers like that out there. Not to mention serving as a wake up call to current teachers, who have forgotten why they trained for this profession, to get back in the game. I'd say, tried and true, it was tried and it is so true!

    Louanne Johnson is an ex-marine, hired as a teacher in a high-school in a poor area of the city. She has recently separated from her husband. Her friend, also teacher in the school, got the temporary job for her. After a terrible reception from the students, she tries unconventional methods of teaching (using karate, Bob Dylan lyrics etc) to gain the trust of the students. And guess what? it works!! In a non-patronising way to the audience.. It's been sixteen years since this film was released here in England, and it was a movie I always resisted in seeing. Mainly because it got so much coverage thanks to that awful song, but it never really appealed to me. Seeing it for the first time last week, I now know why. It's a pitiful movie, cashing in on success of Boyz n the Hood, and high school movies, but with the Bruckheimer and Simpson sheen. It just doesn't work. For one thing the class look almost as old as Pfeiffer, and they warm to her way too soon. Secondl, she goes out of her way to look after these 'kids'. it's as if Edward James Olmos and Morgan Freeman are giving her motivation throughout. Pfeiffer is trying to down play her beauty, wearing a leather jacket and eating junk in every scene, but she doesn't convince. There is nothing new to see, it's just another bad class with hearts of gold movie, and they are tiresome. See 187 instead, that is a movie.

    I wish I had never watched it. Nothing from this movie came out original. Having watched a bunch of "inspirational teacher movies" this one came out lame. The teacher was rather annoying and nosy rather that truly caring and genuine. She was an ex-marine? She didn't look the part and didn't show any sign that she was ever under the rigid and disciplined Marine training. It would have been good if she used some Marine techniques in disciplining her students instead of using Bob Dylan poems to inspire her students. What was the point of making a weak copy cat of "To Sir With Love?" This movie is a sad one. A really sad movie as it should never have been made.

    One reviewer said "unless you lived the life," and others said what they thought, and yet it got a total of 6 among 72 voices. I'm giving it an 8 and I believe it reverberated as "true" and "truth" with one exception: teachers often love their students and give them candy, but the likelihood of a teacher overcoming the system is nil; hence the story portrays truth among students and teacher, but totally fails to address how a teacher who cares, and cares as much as this one did, overcame the bureaucracy and went on teaching. The performances were great across the board and a movie worth seeing more than once.

    wow! i have to say this was a great movie, awesome characters and storyline. the saddest part of it was when Emilio Ramirez was killed, no one was expecting that. What made it even more sad was that the actor who portrayed him, Wade Dominguez died in real life on August 26 1998. i couldn't believe it at first when i read about this, he was so charismatic, handsome, charming and great actor. Although he is gone he will never be forgotten and will always be loved for what a wonderful person he was! Today makes it 13 years since he passed, its just so hard to believe its that long already but hopefully his movies leaves us a legacy! LOVE YOU WADE!!! RIP May 10.1966-August 26, 1998 XOXO

    Plot: A teacher gets a job in a certain high school and hopelessly tries to help a class full of poor students do something with their lives, while they try to survive the streets they were born onto. You'll love Dangerous Minds if: You don't ask too much out of a movie like this and of course if you like Michelle Pfeiffer it's a movie about a teacher that struggles to teach students that come from broken homes and that are more streetwise than she can handle. You might cry with the lives of the kids and you might get angry with the indifference of the teachers but don't expect too much. While not a fan of Michelle I gotta agree that see does a good job in here although her character is a bit TOO sensitive for an ex-marine. You'll hate Dangerous Minds if: You want realism or if you hate soap operas. That's right soap operas. Dangerous Minds feels like a long episode of a soap opera. Logic and realism are almost non-existent. The first day the teacher enters the class the students almost ate her and some days later they were all behaving themselves, answering vocabulary questions while the teacher was throwing candy bars at them, ("good boy!!!", "Woof!"). The movie's concept is good, the execution is the problem. The kids will make you feel sad about their desperate struggle to cope up with their lives but the way the teacher connects with them leaves something to be desired FINAL VERDICT: Won't Change Your Life (3.7/10) [+] Decent acting. You might shed a tear at times. [-] Good concept, bad execution. Not as dark as it should be in my opinion. Too much like a soap opera episode. Also Check: Dead Poets Society (1989)  Good Will Hunting (1997) - Stand And Deliver  Up The Down Staircase (1967) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I've enjoyed dramas about teachers who help their students make a difference, such as 'Lean on Me', 'Freedom Writers', and 'One Eight Seven', but this is hardly one of them. The teacher doesn't come close to being remotely strict, and the students don't seem particularly indifferent. The movie isn't so much about ethics as it is about getting inside the heads of these people. There's nothing at stake here. The amusement park and restaurant scenes aren't earned, and aren't necessary. Movies like this don't have to be conventional, but they should mean something. The parts of the film that do work, are when Pfeiffer's character is interacting with the other adults. The relationship between her and the students didn't work for me. **1/2 out of ****

    This film could not have been any worse if they tried. We have seen these types of films before when a teacher or principle goes into a school that is filled with tough kids and by the end they all love the teacher. Dangerous Minds may be based on a true story but it is not an original idea and certainly not worthy of being made into a movie. OK so a teacher by the name of Louanne Johnson played by Michelle Pfeiffer inspires kids to learn and love poetry by having them listen to Bob Dylan songs. Big deal. Think of all the great teachers out there that reached trouble kids by some creative means. What about their story's? Aside from that Michelle Pfeiffer is mis-cast as some ex-Marine. She does not pull off the part and is less than convincing. The film makers also are deceptive in their telling the story of Louanne Johnson. She never used Bob Dlyan songs to teach her class but rather rap music. I guess the film makers felt rap might offend the audience. Do a little research on this teacher and see for yourself. A very bad film...

    Cheesy Cringe-worthy Punch-in-the-face-worthy soppy acting from Michelle Pfeiffer Stereotypes blown totally out of proportion Poor camera work Diabolical musical overlay Badly scripted Rushed feel No real closure I cannot criticise this movie enough. While I was expecting a typically dark gangster/student-type movie, addressing the inner-city problems of troubled kids in poverty-stricken areas, and the interesting, inspiring attempts of an admirable teacher to get to the bottom of their various dysfunctions, what I instead got was something so cheesy it would have been better suited to Broadway, if they threw in some hastily written musical numbers. For something (slightly) more realistic, see Coach Carter, but please, please, don't waste the 1 hr 30 mins I did on Dangerous Minds, the mis-titled waste of film roll that it is.
