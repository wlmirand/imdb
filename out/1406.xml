 <sinopse>
  An uptight and conservative woman, working on tenure as a literacy professor at a large urban university, finds herself strangely attracted to a free-spirited, liberal woman who works at a local carnival that comes to town.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Camille and Martin are in love and teachers at a christian college; they get the opportunity to get a better job, but they would have to marry for that. But when Camille's dog dies, she recognizes that her love for Martin is not even as big as the love for her dog. After that, Camille gets to know Petra, and Petra falls in love with Camille. They meet again, but Camille is very unsure about her feelings. When Martin is away for a weekend, Camille and Petra meet in the Circus where Petra is working as an acrobat. They spend the night together, but Martin finds out about it and is shocked. He has an argument with Camille, and she goes burying her dog in the snow, and falls asleep...

    When Night is Falling is notable for one of the strongest and most realistic depiction of a lesbian sexual relationship ever seen on screen, and to its credit it portrays a lesbian relationship more naturally and positively than most films do, and if it helped any person anywhere feel better and more secure about their own sexuality, then it did its part and I applaud it. As a piece of cinema, though, it didn't really work for me. Pascale Bussi&egrave;res and Rachael Crawford are both quite good, but I didn't see any real chemistry between them; there's a sense of connection between the two only in the (very powerful and sensual) sex scenes, and since the film tries to portray their relationship as a romantic one in addition to a sexual one, I feel like it failed. Camille and Petra are clearly attracted to each other and Camille is in love with the concept that is Petra, but I never felt convinced that there's any genuine feeling between them. The romantic relationship between the two women remains a fairy-tale, and it doesn't have the realistic emotion that the film tries to achieve. It doesn't help matters that the film tries for a statement against organized religion for trying to repress same-sex relationships. The problem here is that in the same breath the church chastises heterosexual relationships with about the same fervor as same-sex ones, and the criticism comes off muddled and vague. The film tries hard to make itself memorable with some very pretty cinematography and tons of metaphors, but in the end it felt clumsy and amateurish to me. On one hand it strives for an honest and realistic depiction of a love affair; on the other it muddles it up with religious imagery and spiritual symbolism and it all feels like too much of an effort. It's all quite pretty, and the film indeed has some very memorable scenes, but it doesn't help the story or the message in any way, and it's not done well enough to make the film a real artistic achievement. For all the good it does, it stays on the level of an after-school special, rather than a true piece of cinema.

    Vaguely familiar; all through the movie, I could have sworn that I had seen it before on late-night HBO or Cinemax while trolling for nudity as a teenager. But looking at its release year, I'm kind of doubting it. Still, this dreamy bit of 90s erotica feels like the kind of movies I was watching on pay cable late at night, after I was sure everyone else in the house was asleep. It's a Canadian film - I can tell because of the presence of Don McKellar (also it ends with a Leonard Cohen song). Pascale Bussieres plays a professor at a Christian college in Toronto. She meets up with circus performer Rachael Crawford at a laundromat. Crawford is instantly attracted to her and makes sure they are to meet again and, upon that next meeting, makes no bones about her intentions. Bussiere is intrigued, but, as a Christian, one who is engaged to be married, no less (to Henry Czerny), she initially resists. She's never met anyone else like Crawford, though, and the intrigue and excitement soon melt her defenses. Man, this film is HOT. There really isn't much sex, but when they get to it, it's blistering. Rozema builds it up just right. While, in its essence, When Night Is Falling is basically softcore porn, it is impressively artful. The circus performances in particular are great, and Crawford's costumes are awesome. The performances are pretty good, too. The writing isn't especially strong. The climax in particular is silly and relies on a ridiculous coincidence - not to mention an especially silly plot development that plays out in short snippets during the credits. I really liked the film, though. Definitely recommended.

    I saw this years ago at Brattle Theatre in Cambridge and never forgot it. My memory about the plot is vague but it goes something like this--It's about a woman living with a boyfriend who doesn't love or respect her. Then the circus comes to town and she falls in love with a woman working there. She tries to fight the feeling but finally gives in. It leads to a happy (if somewhat unbelievable) conclusion. This gained some controversy when it was first released because it was slapped with an NC-17. Why? The MPAA felt the sex scene between the two women was too explicit! That's absolutely ridiculous. I saw the uncut version and the sequence was soft core, erotic and not even remotely explicit. The director accused the MPAA of homophobia but cut out a minute or so to get the R rating. Sex aside this was beautifully done. The acting was good, the script interesting and well directed. It drew me in completely and the happy ending was great. If you get a chance see it. Wonderful movie.

    Personally, I thought this movie was as bizarre as the "Sirkus of Souls" that was featured in it. Camille (Pascale Bussieres) is a mythology teacher at a Christian college. It is a typical movie-world caricature of all things Christian, so that the college is filled with rather unlikable characters, headed by "the Reverend" (David Fox). It's homophobic, and that part of the story is filled with clich&eacute; theological lines like "love the sinner and hate the sin." Camille is also having an affair (outside marriage) with Martin (Henry Czerny) - a theology teacher who, aside from one sex scene with Camille, appears to have both the personality and passion of a fish. After Camille's dog dies (and for some reason she decides to stick the dog's body in her refrigerator) she goes to do her laundry, and at the local laundry mat meets circus performer Petra (Rachael Crawford). Immediately attracted to each other, they circle for a bit, and then become passionate lovers. I understand that this is a kind of "finding yourself" story. Camille is breaking free of her past and discovering her real identity, etc., etc. But this was really way too weird  beginning with the decision to put the dog in the refrigerator. I also found it  shall we say  disingenuous (because that sounds much nicer than dishonest) when I discovered that in an interview a couple of years ago, writer-director Patricia Rozema flatly stated that her intention in this movie was not to "titillate"  because that's something only porn movies do, she said. Balderdash. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she should have left out the three sex scenes in the movie, the one between Camille and Martin, and two others between Camille and Petra. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she could have stuck with a sensual rather than a sexual portrayal of the relationship between Camille and Petra. The sensuality and even Camille's growing interest in Petra could have been portrayed quite easily without the sex (the massage scene, for example, was totally innocent and yet perhaps the most sensual scene in the entire movie.) Rozema seems to be protesting a bit too much on that point. The movie's ending got its point across, but there was really no mystery to the movie's point. Camille falls asleep in the snow and essentially freezes to death from hypothermia, but she's revived by  among other things  lots of cuddles and snuggles from Petra and she re-awakens into a new life. Yeah. I got it. What I really didn't get was why the dog woke up after  and where the dog was going? (2/10)

    Camille is a professor at a conservative Christian college who is affianced to minister and co-worker Martin. When Camille meets and is attracted to nervy and vivacious circus acrobat Petra, an inner tension begins to build within her. One gets the feeling the film-maker double majored in Art and Theater as this film is bursting with circus-themed surrealist metaphors and intense use of saturated colors. The surrealism sometimes seems a little heavy-handed, but I understand the film-maker was trying to contrast the Christian college milieu with that of the circus folk. The acting is very good and the film excels at depicting the hesitancy and awkwardness involved in striking out in an entirely new direction. Can you simultaneously reach physical fulfillment and grow spiritually by finding your erotic center and exploring new sexual possibilities? That's the question this film deals with. To the scriptwriter's credit, the professors and ministers who espouse decidedly conservative positions with regard to homosexuality are not superstitious, fire- breathing gay-bashers. There are some beautifully filmed and - by U.S. standards - quite revealing scenes of lesbian love-making in "When Night Is Falling," so if this sort of thing disturbs you, steer clear. In sum, this film works well and conveys the difficulty, awkwardness and joy of discovering new ways of being. To quote first Camille and then Petra: "I'm nervous." "So am I; I think you're supposed to be."

    I loved this movie! I first saw it when it was released in a little art house movie theatre in San Diego, and wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into. I was surprised and moved by the experience. The direction, writing, and overall experience was enchanting. The sensuality of the picture was breathtaking and riveting! If you want a picture that makes you feel and root for the heroines of the plot this is the movie to watch. The story is written with a quiet push to realize the emotions of all involved and wanting to see what happens in the next scene. The cinematography and art direction only add to the well written story, and the acting was done with deft aptitude. The director allowed each actor to express and show the experiences of each character that only made the overall movie all that much more amazing! The emotion of discovering who you are and the ability to strike out for the unknown was done with an exacting gentleness that I have rarely seen in movies!

    Pascale Bussieres, a Quebecois actress makes her English- speaking debut, as Camille, a teacher at a Christian college that has never let loose. She is crying in a laundromat after losing her dog, when she meets Petra (Rachael Crawford), a circus performer. Showing up at the circus to deliver laundry that Petra left behind, Camille enters a world of fantasy that she has never experienced. Canadian film maker Patricia Rozema (Kit Kittredge: An American Girl) gives us a strangely surreal world in which freedom and change battles repression and conformity. The film was given an NC-17 rating, ostensibly for the lesbian sex scenes, and this affected the ratings given by some reviewers, but the heterosexual scene with Camille's fianc&eacute;e was much more graphic. The lesbian scenes are tastefully done in a soft focus and very beautiful. Everyone dreams of running off to join the circus at one time or another. In this case, it is a metaphor for being who you truly are. It takes courage, and we wonder whether or not Camille possesses that courage. A gloriously beautiful film with a marvelous love story.

    When Night is Falling is the most exotic love story I've ever watched. What I admire most is the idea of putting together two women of very different patterns and create a romantic masterpiece: Camille Baker, a strict but sensitive university professor who teaches at a religious college and Petra, a charming circus performer. I reckon Camille Baker and Petra's encounter resembles a child's first visit to the circus. All those colored and glittering lights, the clowns who make him burst into laughter, the most risky numbers make him feel odd but happy. For Camille Baker, visiting the circus is entering the tunnel of love. Instead of thousands of lights, she sees only one and she's afraid of reaching it, instead of risky numbers she is dealing with love and hopelessly tries to deny it. She is no longer Camille Baker, the conservative figure, but plainly Camille. They are just two women, Camille and Petra, an expression of pure love. WNIF is an emotional and haunting film which also gives a fascinating a insight on circus life. I express my admiration towards Rachel Crawford who portrayed an intelligent, deadly feminine and independent woman who didn't give up her pursuit of happiness. There is a chemistry between Camille and Petra which is kind of rare. They are both beautiful women with loads of sex-appeal, but they're beautiful in different ways: Camille is the sober type, betraying her chained passion by a pair of "exquisite lips" and Petra is the exotic beauty, like a panther in captivity which is left into the wild. Along with her appearance, she put Camille's boyfriend (Martin) into shadow and straight away, he becomes Camille's cat's paw in her process of denying her feelings for Petra. I give this movie 10/10 because it didn't come out as a lesbian movie, but as a gorgeous love story.

    Seeing this movie was an emotionally breathtaking experience for me. The story line and character development, the tenderness, passion and at the same time tension between the two main characters are so appealing, warm, truly human that seeing this movie is a treat every time again. The first time I rented it on video was probably ten years ago, and I keep returning to it every couple of years. The images are beautiful, the music is and the main plot theme of falling in love with someone of whom you least expect it, especially if that person is of your own gender, continues to strike me. Both main actresses are very appealing and seeing this movie almost makes you want to experience the same emotions and going through the same process. A must see for admirers of a poetic love story filled with stunning images and deeply human emotions.

    Pretty average film, the lead seems like quite a decent actress, shame that her love interest was so wooden. There were attempts to make some sort of religious points but they never seemed to lead anywhere, the plot is basic and shallow. The carnival elements were really campy but served their main purpose so far that they contrasted with the lifestyle of Camille. I thought it was a made for TV movie to be honest but it looks like it is supposed to be an art house film. The best thing about this film ?, there is an absolutely hilarious payoff at the end (although I am sure it was not intended to be funny by the film maker).

What I admire most is the idea of putting together two women of very different patterns and create a romantic masterpiece: Camille Baker, a strict but sensitive university professor who teaches at a religious college and Petra, a charming circus performer. I reckon Camille Baker and Petra's encounter resembles a child's first visit to the circus. All those colored and glittering lights, the clowns who make him burst into laughter, the most risky numbers make him feel odd but happy. For Camille Baker, visiting the circus is entering the tunnel of love. Instead of thousands of lights, she sees only one and she's afraid of reaching it, instead of risky numbers she is dealing with love and hopelessly tries to deny it. She is no longer Camille Baker, the conservative figure, but plainly Camille. They are just two women, Camille and Petra, an expression of pure love. WNIF is an emotional and haunting film which also gives a fascinating a insight on circus life. I express my admiration towards Rachel Crawford who portrayed an intelligent, deadly feminine and independent woman who didn't give up her pursuit of happiness. There is a chemistry between Camille and Petra which is kind of rare. They are both beautiful women with loads of sex-appeal, but they're beautiful in different ways: Camille is the sober type, betraying her chained passion by a pair of "exquisite lips" and Petra is the exotic beauty, like a panther in captivity which is left into the wild. Along with her appearance, she put Camille's boyfriend (Martin) into shadow and straight away, he becomes Camille's cat's paw in her process of denying her feelings for Petra. I give this movie 10/10 because it didn't come out as a lesbian movie, but as a gorgeous love story.

    Seeing this movie was an emotionally breathtaking experience for me. The story line and character development, the tenderness, passion and at the same time tension between the two main characters are so appealing, warm, truly human that seeing this movie is a treat every time again. The first time I rented it on video was probably ten years ago, and I keep returning to it every couple of years. The images are beautiful, the music is and the main plot theme of falling in love with someone of whom you least expect it, especially if that person is of your own gender, continues to strike me. Both main actresses are very appealing and seeing this movie almost makes you want to experience the same emotions and going through the same process. A must see for admirers of a poetic love story filled with stunning images and deeply human emotions.

    Pretty average film, the lead seems like quite a decent actress, shame that her love interest was so wooden. There were attempts to make some sort of religious points but they never seemed to lead anywhere, the plot is basic and shallow. The carnival elements were really campy but served their main purpose so far that they contrasted with the lifestyle of Camille. I thought it was a made for TV movie to be honest but it looks like it is supposed to be an art house film. The best thing about this film ?, there is an absolutely hilarious payoff at the end (although I am sure it was not intended to be funny by the film maker).

    When Night is Falling is notable for one of the strongest and most realistic depiction of a lesbian sexual relationship ever seen on screen, and to its credit it portrays a lesbian relationship more naturally and positively than most films do, and if it helped any person anywhere feel better and more secure about their own sexuality, then it did its part and I applaud it. As a piece of cinema, though, it didn't really work for me. Pascale Bussi&egrave;res and Rachael Crawford are both quite good, but I didn't see any real chemistry between them; there's a sense of connection between the two only in the (very powerful and sensual) sex scenes, and since the film tries to portray their relationship as a romantic one in addition to a sexual one, I feel like it failed. Camille and Petra are clearly attracted to each other and Camille is in love with the concept that is Petra, but I never felt convinced that there's any genuine feeling between them. The romantic relationship between the two women remains a fairy-tale, and it doesn't have the realistic emotion that the film tries to achieve. It doesn't help matters that the film tries for a statement against organized religion for trying to repress same-sex relationships. The problem here is that in the same breath the church chastises heterosexual relationships with about the same fervor as same-sex ones, and the criticism comes off muddled and vague. The film tries hard to make itself memorable with some very pretty cinematography and tons of metaphors, but in the end it felt clumsy and amateurish to me. On one hand it strives for an honest and realistic depiction of a love affair; on the other it muddles it up with religious imagery and spiritual symbolism and it all feels like too much of an effort. It's all quite pretty, and the film indeed has some very memorable scenes, but it doesn't help the story or the message in any way, and it's not done well enough to make the film a real artistic achievement. For all the good it does, it stays on the level of an after-school special, rather than a true piece of cinema.

    Vaguely familiar; all through the movie, I could have sworn that I had seen it before on late-night HBO or Cinemax while trolling for nudity as a teenager. But looking at its release year, I'm kind of doubting it. Still, this dreamy bit of 90s erotica feels like the kind of movies I was watching on pay cable late at night, after I was sure everyone else in the house was asleep. It's a Canadian film - I can tell because of the presence of Don McKellar (also it ends with a Leonard Cohen song). Pascale Bussieres plays a professor at a Christian college in Toronto. She meets up with circus performer Rachael Crawford at a laundromat. Crawford is instantly attracted to her and makes sure they are to meet again and, upon that next meeting, makes no bones about her intentions. Bussiere is intrigued, but, as a Christian, one who is engaged to be married, no less (to Henry Czerny), she initially resists. She's never met anyone else like Crawford, though, and the intrigue and excitement soon melt her defenses. Man, this film is HOT. There really isn't much sex, but when they get to it, it's blistering. Rozema builds it up just right. While, in its essence, When Night Is Falling is basically softcore porn, it is impressively artful. The circus performances in particular are great, and Crawford's costumes are awesome. The performances are pretty good, too. The writing isn't especially strong. The climax in particular is silly and relies on a ridiculous coincidence - not to mention an especially silly plot development that plays out in short snippets during the credits. I really liked the film, though. Definitely recommended.

    I saw this years ago at Brattle Theatre in Cambridge and never forgot it. My memory about the plot is vague but it goes something like this--It's about a woman living with a boyfriend who doesn't love or respect her. Then the circus comes to town and she falls in love with a woman working there. She tries to fight the feeling but finally gives in. It leads to a happy (if somewhat unbelievable) conclusion. This gained some controversy when it was first released because it was slapped with an NC-17. Why? The MPAA felt the sex scene between the two women was too explicit! That's absolutely ridiculous. I saw the uncut version and the sequence was soft core, erotic and not even remotely explicit. The director accused the MPAA of homophobia but cut out a minute or so to get the R rating. Sex aside this was beautifully done. The acting was good, the script interesting and well directed. It drew me in completely and the happy ending was great. If you get a chance see it. Wonderful movie.

    Personally, I thought this movie was as bizarre as the "Sirkus of Souls" that was featured in it. Camille (Pascale Bussieres) is a mythology teacher at a Christian college. It is a typical movie-world caricature of all things Christian, so that the college is filled with rather unlikable characters, headed by "the Reverend" (David Fox). It's homophobic, and that part of the story is filled with clich&eacute; theological lines like "love the sinner and hate the sin." Camille is also having an affair (outside marriage) with Martin (Henry Czerny) - a theology teacher who, aside from one sex scene with Camille, appears to have both the personality and passion of a fish. After Camille's dog dies (and for some reason she decides to stick the dog's body in her refrigerator) she goes to do her laundry, and at the local laundry mat meets circus performer Petra (Rachael Crawford). Immediately attracted to each other, they circle for a bit, and then become passionate lovers. I understand that this is a kind of "finding yourself" story. Camille is breaking free of her past and discovering her real identity, etc., etc. But this was really way too weird  beginning with the decision to put the dog in the refrigerator. I also found it  shall we say  disingenuous (because that sounds much nicer than dishonest) when I discovered that in an interview a couple of years ago, writer-director Patricia Rozema flatly stated that her intention in this movie was not to "titillate"  because that's something only porn movies do, she said. Balderdash. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she should have left out the three sex scenes in the movie, the one between Camille and Martin, and two others between Camille and Petra. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she could have stuck with a sensual rather than a sexual portrayal of the relationship between Camille and Petra. The sensuality and even Camille's growing interest in Petra could have been portrayed quite easily without the sex (the massage scene, for example, was totally innocent and yet perhaps the most sensual scene in the entire movie.) Rozema seems to be protesting a bit too much on that point. The movie's ending got its point across, but there was really no mystery to the movie's point. Camille falls asleep in the snow and essentially freezes to death from hypothermia, but she's revived by  among other things  lots of cuddles and snuggles from Petra and she re-awakens into a new life. Yeah. I got it. What I really didn't get was why the dog woke up after  and where the dog was going? (2/10)

    Camille is a professor at a conservative Christian college who is affianced to minister and co-worker Martin. When Camille meets and is attracted to nervy and vivacious circus acrobat Petra, an inner tension begins to build within her. One gets the feeling the film-maker double majored in Art and Theater as this film is bursting with circus-themed surrealist metaphors and intense use of saturated colors. The surrealism sometimes seems a little heavy-handed, but I understand the film-maker was trying to contrast the Christian college milieu with that of the circus folk. The acting is very good and the film excels at depicting the hesitancy and awkwardness involved in striking out in an entirely new direction. Can you simultaneously reach physical fulfillment and grow spiritually by finding your erotic center and exploring new sexual possibilities? That's the question this film deals with. To the scriptwriter's credit, the professors and ministers who espouse decidedly conservative positions with regard to homosexuality are not superstitious, fire- breathing gay-bashers. There are some beautifully filmed and - by U.S. standards - quite revealing scenes of lesbian love-making in "When Night Is Falling," so if this sort of thing disturbs you, steer clear. In sum, this film works well and conveys the difficulty, awkwardness and joy of discovering new ways of being. To quote first Camille and then Petra: "I'm nervous." "So am I; I think you're supposed to be."

    I loved this movie! I first saw it when it was released in a little art house movie theatre in San Diego, and wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into. I was surprised and moved by the experience. The direction, writing, and overall experience was enchanting. The sensuality of the picture was breathtaking and riveting! If you want a picture that makes you feel and root for the heroines of the plot this is the movie to watch. The story is written with a quiet push to realize the emotions of all involved and wanting to see what happens in the next scene. The cinematography and art direction only add to the well written story, and the acting was done with deft aptitude. The director allowed each actor to express and show the experiences of each character that only made the overall movie all that much more amazing! The emotion of discovering who you are and the ability to strike out for the unknown was done with an exacting gentleness that I have rarely seen in movies!

    Pascale Bussieres, a Quebecois actress makes her English- speaking debut, as Camille, a teacher at a Christian college that has never let loose. She is crying in a laundromat after losing her dog, when she meets Petra (Rachael Crawford), a circus performer. Showing up at the circus to deliver laundry that Petra left behind, Camille enters a world of fantasy that she has never experienced. Canadian film maker Patricia Rozema (Kit Kittredge: An American Girl) gives us a strangely surreal world in which freedom and change battles repression and conformity. The film was given an NC-17 rating, ostensibly for the lesbian sex scenes, and this affected the ratings given by some reviewers, but the heterosexual scene with Camille's fianc&eacute;e was much more graphic. The lesbian scenes are tastefully done in a soft focus and very beautiful. Everyone dreams of running off to join the circus at one time or another. In this case, it is a metaphor for being who you truly are. It takes courage, and we wonder whether or not Camille possesses that courage. A gloriously beautiful film with a marvelous love story.

Showing up at the circus to deliver laundry that Petra left behind, Camille enters a world of fantasy that she has never experienced. Canadian film maker Patricia Rozema (Kit Kittredge: An American Girl) gives us a strangely surreal world in which freedom and change battles repression and conformity. The film was given an NC-17 rating, ostensibly for the lesbian sex scenes, and this affected the ratings given by some reviewers, but the heterosexual scene with Camille's fianc&eacute;e was much more graphic. The lesbian scenes are tastefully done in a soft focus and very beautiful. Everyone dreams of running off to join the circus at one time or another. In this case, it is a metaphor for being who you truly are. It takes courage, and we wonder whether or not Camille possesses that courage. A gloriously beautiful film with a marvelous love story.

    When Night is Falling is the most exotic love story I've ever watched. What I admire most is the idea of putting together two women of very different patterns and create a romantic masterpiece: Camille Baker, a strict but sensitive university professor who teaches at a religious college and Petra, a charming circus performer. I reckon Camille Baker and Petra's encounter resembles a child's first visit to the circus. All those colored and glittering lights, the clowns who make him burst into laughter, the most risky numbers make him feel odd but happy. For Camille Baker, visiting the circus is entering the tunnel of love. Instead of thousands of lights, she sees only one and she's afraid of reaching it, instead of risky numbers she is dealing with love and hopelessly tries to deny it. She is no longer Camille Baker, the conservative figure, but plainly Camille. They are just two women, Camille and Petra, an expression of pure love. WNIF is an emotional and haunting film which also gives a fascinating a insight on circus life. I express my admiration towards Rachel Crawford who portrayed an intelligent, deadly feminine and independent woman who didn't give up her pursuit of happiness. There is a chemistry between Camille and Petra which is kind of rare. They are both beautiful women with loads of sex-appeal, but they're beautiful in different ways: Camille is the sober type, betraying her chained passion by a pair of "exquisite lips" and Petra is the exotic beauty, like a panther in captivity which is left into the wild. Along with her appearance, she put Camille's boyfriend (Martin) into shadow and straight away, he becomes Camille's cat's paw in her process of denying her feelings for Petra. I give this movie 10/10 because it didn't come out as a lesbian movie, but as a gorgeous love story.

    Seeing this movie was an emotionally breathtaking experience for me. The story line and character development, the tenderness, passion and at the same time tension between the two main characters are so appealing, warm, truly human that seeing this movie is a treat every time again. The first time I rented it on video was probably ten years ago, and I keep returning to it every couple of years. The images are beautiful, the music is and the main plot theme of falling in love with someone of whom you least expect it, especially if that person is of your own gender, continues to strike me. Both main actresses are very appealing and seeing this movie almost makes you want to experience the same emotions and going through the same process. A must see for admirers of a poetic love story filled with stunning images and deeply human emotions.

    Pretty average film, the lead seems like quite a decent actress, shame that her love interest was so wooden. There were attempts to make some sort of religious points but they never seemed to lead anywhere, the plot is basic and shallow. The carnival elements were really campy but served their main purpose so far that they contrasted with the lifestyle of Camille. I thought it was a made for TV movie to be honest but it looks like it is supposed to be an art house film. The best thing about this film ?, there is an absolutely hilarious payoff at the end (although I am sure it was not intended to be funny by the film maker).

    When Night is Falling is notable for one of the strongest and most realistic depiction of a lesbian sexual relationship ever seen on screen, and to its credit it portrays a lesbian relationship more naturally and positively than most films do, and if it helped any person anywhere feel better and more secure about their own sexuality, then it did its part and I applaud it. As a piece of cinema, though, it didn't really work for me. Pascale Bussi&egrave;res and Rachael Crawford are both quite good, but I didn't see any real chemistry between them; there's a sense of connection between the two only in the (very powerful and sensual) sex scenes, and since the film tries to portray their relationship as a romantic one in addition to a sexual one, I feel like it failed. Camille and Petra are clearly attracted to each other and Camille is in love with the concept that is Petra, but I never felt convinced that there's any genuine feeling between them. The romantic relationship between the two women remains a fairy-tale, and it doesn't have the realistic emotion that the film tries to achieve. It doesn't help matters that the film tries for a statement against organized religion for trying to repress same-sex relationships. The problem here is that in the same breath the church chastises heterosexual relationships with about the same fervor as same-sex ones, and the criticism comes off muddled and vague. The film tries hard to make itself memorable with some very pretty cinematography and tons of metaphors, but in the end it felt clumsy and amateurish to me. On one hand it strives for an honest and realistic depiction of a love affair; on the other it muddles it up with religious imagery and spiritual symbolism and it all feels like too much of an effort. It's all quite pretty, and the film indeed has some very memorable scenes, but it doesn't help the story or the message in any way, and it's not done well enough to make the film a real artistic achievement. For all the good it does, it stays on the level of an after-school special, rather than a true piece of cinema.

    Vaguely familiar; all through the movie, I could have sworn that I had seen it before on late-night HBO or Cinemax while trolling for nudity as a teenager. But looking at its release year, I'm kind of doubting it. Still, this dreamy bit of 90s erotica feels like the kind of movies I was watching on pay cable late at night, after I was sure everyone else in the house was asleep. It's a Canadian film - I can tell because of the presence of Don McKellar (also it ends with a Leonard Cohen song). Pascale Bussieres plays a professor at a Christian college in Toronto. She meets up with circus performer Rachael Crawford at a laundromat. Crawford is instantly attracted to her and makes sure they are to meet again and, upon that next meeting, makes no bones about her intentions. Bussiere is intrigued, but, as a Christian, one who is engaged to be married, no less (to Henry Czerny), she initially resists. She's never met anyone else like Crawford, though, and the intrigue and excitement soon melt her defenses. Man, this film is HOT. There really isn't much sex, but when they get to it, it's blistering. Rozema builds it up just right. While, in its essence, When Night Is Falling is basically softcore porn, it is impressively artful. The circus performances in particular are great, and Crawford's costumes are awesome. The performances are pretty good, too. The writing isn't especially strong. The climax in particular is silly and relies on a ridiculous coincidence - not to mention an especially silly plot development that plays out in short snippets during the credits. I really liked the film, though. Definitely recommended.

    I saw this years ago at Brattle Theatre in Cambridge and never forgot it. My memory about the plot is vague but it goes something like this--It's about a woman living with a boyfriend who doesn't love or respect her. Then the circus comes to town and she falls in love with a woman working there. She tries to fight the feeling but finally gives in. It leads to a happy (if somewhat unbelievable) conclusion. This gained some controversy when it was first released because it was slapped with an NC-17. Why? The MPAA felt the sex scene between the two women was too explicit! That's absolutely ridiculous. I saw the uncut version and the sequence was soft core, erotic and not even remotely explicit. The director accused the MPAA of homophobia but cut out a minute or so to get the R rating. Sex aside this was beautifully done. The acting was good, the script interesting and well directed. It drew me in completely and the happy ending was great. If you get a chance see it. Wonderful movie.

    Personally, I thought this movie was as bizarre as the "Sirkus of Souls" that was featured in it. Camille (Pascale Bussieres) is a mythology teacher at a Christian college. It is a typical movie-world caricature of all things Christian, so that the college is filled with rather unlikable characters, headed by "the Reverend" (David Fox). It's homophobic, and that part of the story is filled with clich&eacute; theological lines like "love the sinner and hate the sin." Camille is also having an affair (outside marriage) with Martin (Henry Czerny) - a theology teacher who, aside from one sex scene with Camille, appears to have both the personality and passion of a fish. After Camille's dog dies (and for some reason she decides to stick the dog's body in her refrigerator) she goes to do her laundry, and at the local laundry mat meets circus performer Petra (Rachael Crawford). Immediately attracted to each other, they circle for a bit, and then become passionate lovers. I understand that this is a kind of "finding yourself" story. Camille is breaking free of her past and discovering her real identity, etc., etc. But this was really way too weird  beginning with the decision to put the dog in the refrigerator. I also found it  shall we say  disingenuous (because that sounds much nicer than dishonest) when I discovered that in an interview a couple of years ago, writer-director Patricia Rozema flatly stated that her intention in this movie was not to "titillate"  because that's something only porn movies do, she said. Balderdash. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she should have left out the three sex scenes in the movie, the one between Camille and Martin, and two others between Camille and Petra. If she wanted to avoid titillation perhaps she could have stuck with a sensual rather than a sexual portrayal of the relationship between Camille and Petra. The sensuality and even Camille's growing interest in Petra could have been portrayed quite easily without the sex (the massage scene, for example, was totally innocent and yet perhaps the most sensual scene in the entire movie.) Rozema seems to be protesting a bit too much on that point. The movie's ending got its point across, but there was really no mystery to the movie's point. Camille falls asleep in the snow and essentially freezes to death from hypothermia, but she's revived by  among other things  lots of cuddles and snuggles from Petra and she re-awakens into a new life. Yeah. I got it. What I really didn't get was why the dog woke up after  and where the dog was going? (2/10)

    Camille is a professor at a conservative Christian college who is affianced to minister and co-worker Martin. When Camille meets and is attracted to nervy and vivacious circus acrobat Petra, an inner tension begins to build within her. One gets the feeling the film-maker double majored in Art and Theater as this film is bursting with circus-themed surrealist metaphors and intense use of saturated colors. The surrealism sometimes seems a little heavy-handed, but I understand the film-maker was trying to contrast the Christian college milieu with that of the circus folk. The acting is very good and the film excels at depicting the hesitancy and awkwardness involved in striking out in an entirely new direction. Can you simultaneously reach physical fulfillment and grow spiritually by finding your erotic center and exploring new sexual possibilities? That's the question this film deals with. To the scriptwriter's credit, the professors and ministers who espouse decidedly conservative positions with regard to homosexuality are not superstitious, fire- breathing gay-bashers. There are some beautifully filmed and - by U.S. standards - quite revealing scenes of lesbian love-making in "When Night Is Falling," so if this sort of thing disturbs you, steer clear. In sum, this film works well and conveys the difficulty, awkwardness and joy of discovering new ways of being. To quote first Camille and then Petra: "I'm nervous." "So am I; I think you're supposed to be."

    I loved this movie! I first saw it when it was released in a little art house movie theatre in San Diego, and wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into. I was surprised and moved by the experience. The direction, writing, and overall experience was enchanting. The sensuality of the picture was breathtaking and riveting! If you want a picture that makes you feel and root for the heroines of the plot this is the movie to watch. The story is written with a quiet push to realize the emotions of all involved and wanting to see what happens in the next scene. The cinematography and art direction only add to the well written story, and the acting was done with deft aptitude. The director allowed each actor to express and show the experiences of each character that only made the overall movie all that much more amazing! The emotion of discovering who you are and the ability to strike out for the unknown was done with an exacting gentleness that I have rarely seen in movies!
