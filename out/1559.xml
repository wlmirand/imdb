    yup, I was the punk rocker guy who, along with my punk girlfriend, are seen tearing thru the party. Later, when TC comes to get her purse, we're passed-out on the bed, intoxicated. My fellow extra (punk girl) was pretty good looking, and I was disappointed when I found-out she wasn't a punker in real life. My character in that movie dressed exactly the way I did in 1993...it was the part I was born to play. Useless but true: the working title was "No Man's Land." I swear. Hey, I got union pay for that job, so that made it a great movie. Craft services was really good too.

    Extremely funny - but without intention. I used it to light up a rainy Easter holiday. Another movie, where the authoress/directress takes things very, very, very SERIOUS!! Maybe it is a comment about rape and male violence?!? Then I fully agree to any message that I did not find! Because the message is carried by "megababe" (Wayne's World) Tia Carrere, who fires guns, wears boots and a miniskirt and grimaces like the Little Masochist's nightmare (watch her faces, when she rides the motorbike!). And, in the beginning, the others say, that she even "likes sex". What a dream! I was happy that she never practised sex during the movie, so that she is still untouched in my dreams... (to make the ending more sentimental, she ends up with a son, even without sex before) No, seriously: this serious movie is dealing with the serious topic of brutal rape in third-world-prisons. We learn serious information: that third-world-policemen read bondage magazines and rape every innocent woman who enters their jail. That a woman lawyer, who is supposed to be one of the good girls, takes drugs from complete strangers. That her future husband is a complete loser. That two stupid, horny, drug-abusing bad guys can cross a room unnoticed in the good guys' back, because the good guys were too busy watching the room for enemies (the good guys came to fetch their money, instead they only sneak through the house, searching for trouble). We learn that smugglers, who are supposed to bring lexicon's across the border, shoot them instead... We learn about the art of movie writing: you can write anything that comes to your mind, no matter how stupid. For example bloody shootouts. You don't need any reason or explanation. Make the your characters silly; no one cares, only some nerdy IMDb writers - This comment gets too long! - Let me only add, that this bad movie had a good marketing abroad! Viewers from New Zealand, Bulgaria and Germany! And I strongly recommend the German version for additional humour: the Mexican people change languages quicker than underwear. When they swear and talk to each other, they use German, which is translated by English subtitles, but sometimes, without reason, they only speak Spanish, without subtitles. Well, no one cares.

    If I had looked up this film here on IMDB prior to searching for a video, I would not have picked this one. Anyway, our video stores here offer cheap deals on Tuesdays so I quickly chose Hostile Intentions, one of 4 videos for only a NZ dollar each. I will have to admit that I only had the energy that evening to watch something simple, and to be honest, the sexy woman on the front cover were appealing. Actually I was also intrigued about Tia Carrere, who is in some TV action series these days. The worst part of the film for me is that it does the usual Hollywood exaggeration of events and stereotypes, which stretches the imagination. Then again, there are some over-the-top people in this area of the world! But I have seen much worse films. The acting, script and action are quite good (put in context), and there is plenty of eye candy for the guys. I think the main reason that I liked this film was that I did not expect any more than a sexy action flick. Usually my tastes are far higher, towards the intelligent art house films. If you can see this for free or on the cheap, and don't expect much, then go ahead and see it.

    Another movie about some young, attractive Americans who go to Mexico to party hearty, dude, but find that their dream vacation has turned into a nightmare. Hasn't this ground been covered before? Haven't we seen dozens of movies with fresh-faced young heroes battling the twin demons of corrupt Mexican policemen and unresponsive American bureaucrats? In "Hostile Intentions," three young American women cross the border with partying on their mind. They accept an invitation to a party that turns nasty, then get arrested, then...well, use your imagination as to what rotten things happen to them next. Along the way, they hook up with a Mexican guy who may or may not be on their side, then meet his family, then things get complicated as the film explores illegal immigrant smuggling. This was a prime-time feature on Bulgarian network TV this evening. I'm glad I didn't pay to rent the movie. There isn't really any good reason to see "Hostile Intentions," unless, of course, there's nothing else on TV that hasn't been dubbed into Bulgarian.
