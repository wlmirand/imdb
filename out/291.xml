  Based on the novel by David Baldacci, Absolute Power is about the ruthlessness of people in power. The President believes that everything he does is beyond reproach, including an affair or two.

The Secret Service is determined to keep him quiet, but catching a thief isn't always easy.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

    Allen Richmond, the President of the United States, brings a date to the house of a billionaire called Walter Sullivan.The woman is Christy, Sullivan's wife.Things get pretty violent, and the woman ends up dead, after Secret Service agents shoot her.But there's a witness, a jewel thief called Luther Whitney.He has seen the whole thing through a one-way mirror.The story also involves a detective called Seth Frank and Luther's estranged daughter Kate.Absolute Power (1997) is directed by Clint Eastwood.It's based on David Baldacci's novel.William Goldman, who turned 80 on August, is behind the screenplay.Eastwood also plays the lead of this movie, and he's superb as always.And what's great is that it also has Gene Hackman playing the president.Clint and Gene gave memorable performances in Unforgiven (1992), as we all can remember.Ed Harris is terrific as the detective.Laura Linney gives a marvelous performance as Kate.Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert are excellent as the agents.Judy Davis is wonderful as Chief of Staff Gloria Russell.E.G. Marshall is magnificent as Walter.Melora Hardin is very good as Christy.Richard Jenkins plays Michael McCarty, and he's great.Also Clint's daughters, Alison and Kimber Eastwood are seen in this movie.I just watched this movie on a DVD, having seen it once before.This isn't the most classic Clint, but it is very entertaining.You do enjoy watching Clint escaping the bullets, as if he's forgetting his age.Not that Clint ever would age.

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

Marshall is magnificent as Walter.Melora Hardin is very good as Christy.Richard Jenkins plays Michael McCarty, and he's great.Also Clint's daughters, Alison and Kimber Eastwood are seen in this movie.I just watched this movie on a DVD, having seen it once before.This isn't the most classic Clint, but it is very entertaining.You do enjoy watching Clint escaping the bullets, as if he's forgetting his age.Not that Clint ever would age.

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    Well, it could have been. Mistresses, cover-ups of mysterious deaths... Okay, Clint plays a expert thief who breaks into what he thinks is an empty mansion. He witnesses sex gone bad between the owner's trophy wife and the President played by Gene Hackman. He's all set to flee with his ill-gotten loot when he simply can't stand the hypocrisy of it all and decides to expose the whole reeking business. this is a lot better than most movies of this sort because some of the characters are so well drawn. The Secret Service Agent who goes along with the cover-up, and then regrets it. The hardened detective who suspects Eastwood's involvement, but knows that he is no killer. The estranged daughter. the movie is taut, until it gets to the improbable ending, but if you've followed it this far, you don't care that much.

    After reading David Baldacci's "Absolute Power", I was really looking forward to seeing the film. However it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book. No Jack Graham AT ALL, in fact non of the legal team get a mention, which was one of the best bits of the book. The sex/rape/fight/murder scene at the beginning is pathetic! Luther doesn't get killed!!, central to the book story line! Typical American - Hollywood rubbish. If Hollywood feels the American audience cannot or will not take hard, gritty and sometimes not pleasant viewing/story lines, then stop making films, especially ones that ruin great books!! Absolute Power? ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!

    A jewel thief, Clint Eastwood, gets more than what he bargained for when he witnesses the president having violent sex with his chief benefactor's wife. Things get out of hand and the Secret Service Agents shoot the woman to death. The Eastwood character grabs the knife that she had used to stab the president. Now, everyone is after Eastwood when he flees. There is a very strong supporting performance by Judy Davis as Gloria Russell, a vicious Chief of Staff who will do just about anything to protect the president. (Gene Hackman) This is a taut thriller with a fine supporting cast consisting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and others. To say that all ends reasonably well and everyone gets what they deserve, is to put it mildly. How come actor Dennis Haysbert, who portrays one of the agents, has been reduced to selling insurance in various commercials?

    ABSOLUTE POWER I thought this was a really good movie. When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act. The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run. The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length. Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie. Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney & Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.

    Does anyone know what is the picture appeared in the scene where Kate and police Seth were talking in front of at Luther's hideout apartment? According to information here, the location was writer Christopher Hitchens's apartment. I have the same painting (oil on canvas ) bought almost 20 years ago but never know or ask what the original work is. Mine is probably a reproduction or imitation. We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great! We always love Clint Eastwood; his work like Flags of the Fathers and Letters from Iwojima...etc.

    ***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months. With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton & Tim Collins, Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do! Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating! ***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton & Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!

    First the plusses. It's watchable. The plot moves smartly and the viewer can understand what's going on. That's about it for the plusses. The biggest minus is the absolute predictability. I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged." That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning. I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint. Don't bother.

    Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall. In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.

    Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film. Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film. Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

    Allen Richmond, the President of the United States, brings a date to the house of a billionaire called Walter Sullivan.The woman is Christy, Sullivan's wife.Things get pretty violent, and the woman ends up dead, after Secret Service agents shoot her.But there's a witness, a jewel thief called Luther Whitney.He has seen the whole thing through a one-way mirror.The story also involves a detective called Seth Frank and Luther's estranged daughter Kate.Absolute Power (1997) is directed by Clint Eastwood.It's based on David Baldacci's novel.William Goldman, who turned 80 on August, is behind the screenplay.Eastwood also plays the lead of this movie, and he's superb as always.And what's great is that it also has Gene Hackman playing the president.Clint and Gene gave memorable performances in Unforgiven (1992), as we all can remember.Ed Harris is terrific as the detective.Laura Linney gives a marvelous performance as Kate.Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert are excellent as the agents.Judy Davis is wonderful as Chief of Staff Gloria Russell.E.G. Marshall is magnificent as Walter.Melora Hardin is very good as Christy.Richard Jenkins plays Michael McCarty, and he's great.Also Clint's daughters, Alison and Kimber Eastwood are seen in this movie.I just watched this movie on a DVD, having seen it once before.This isn't the most classic Clint, but it is very entertaining.You do enjoy watching Clint escaping the bullets, as if he's forgetting his age.Not that Clint ever would age.
