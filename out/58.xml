    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    The Black Sox Scandal of Early Television: Outstanding Snap-Shot of the 1950's

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier.

However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    The Black Sox Scandal of Early Television: Outstanding Snap-Shot of the 1950's

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

    Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, The Insider, Scent of Woman, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Big Lebowski ,Pulp Fiction ....1990s - In my opinion the best time for Hollywood. Having said that I admit I haven't watched many 80's , 70's , black n white movies. This is one of the good 90s movies. Based on true events , Quiz show tells the story of a rigged quiz show called 21 aired in 1958. I think Ralph Fienns is the stand out actor out of the talented cast . His part is more than just the charming young professor. Robert Redford has done superb directing job. Rob Morrow's accent bothered me a bit but his "I know you are lying" scene is a classic . Good story , good acting , good direction - very good movie.

    Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points. Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions. As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased. Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

    This film makes you question what you see and hear, especially via the television. In the grander scheme it seems to highlight corporate power and big business propaganda delivered through the newest and most popular medium. The photography and costume design are virtually perfect for a time period piece and allows you to see, despite the clothing and material things, how corrupt so many of our institutions are, at the expense of a very trusting public. Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro are outstanding, but the casting and acting are so excellent in this film that anyone involved in this film should be proud of. There is no better film that shows the world what America is very much like.

    In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. "Quiz Show" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism. Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons. The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show "Twenty One." Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, "take a dive") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture. Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up Â— everyone wins. The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth. "Quiz Show" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the "slight" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really? Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. "Quiz Show" paints an honest portrait of "the business" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as "it's what the people want." Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. "Quiz Show," even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?"

He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really? ~Steven Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!

    The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation. In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case. Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the "Uncle Tom of the Jews" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that "audiences forget, corporations don't". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process. Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film. What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Based on a true story, Robert Redford's 1994 film Quiz Show deals with the socio-political and moral issues of cheating, rigging, and lying. The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns: the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that "Quiz Show"Â—as enjoyable as it isÂ—pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

    QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10). The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way). Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

    Robert Redford masterfully directs this tale of rigged games show 21. John Turturro is perfectly cast as the know-all Jew who is beaten by Ralph Fiennes. What happens after words and the investigation of the television show form the core of the movie. The story is very involving and the lines are witty. The acting is pretty competent and the movie never drags even though it is more than two hours long. This was nominated for the Best Picture along with Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption and though not in the same class as those it holds its own prett nicely even after nearly twenty years. 4 out of 5 for this intriguing and interesting tale of fixed game shows and quirky contestants. Take a bow Mr. Redford.

    The Black Sox Scandal of Early Television: Outstanding Snap-Shot of the 1950's

    Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as "the $64,000 Question" and "21", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions. "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight. Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting. The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show "21" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of "gentile" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, "Marty". Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic. In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed "rules". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent "21" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged. An incredible film with a first-rate cast. "Quiz Show" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

    Although Stempel did follow orders and miss the question about "Marty," the question that eliminated him was a three-parter about a famous editorial. He was told to answer the first two parts: the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would "blank" on the name of the editorial: "What's The Matter With Kansas?" Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier. Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo. Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about "Twenty-One" in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.
