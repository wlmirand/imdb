    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe.

The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio.

As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio.

As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects. The movie adeptly places objects at the right places so as to take the viewer back to a previous moment in the film and give him a feeling of understanding and continuity. It's a refined treatment of the principle of smaller objectives building up to bring out the main objective of the film. Three Colors: Red gives a complex insight of human lives; it tells us something we already know but it's told in a way we've never seen. 'We are so close yet so far, only fate decides whether we'll ever meet' I already know that but to make a movie on this subject and execute it so immaculately is the work of a genius. Krzysztof's handling of his films is tender and invigorating; there is a drop of fiction in his films but the characters have believability in them. This is perhaps the perfect final film for the virtuoso and it should not be missed by people who love cinema and people who love life. My Rating: 10/10

    Rouge's story revolves around a model who, among other things, to get to know a cynical old judge who spies on his neighbors. However, it is not the story itself which is the focus of the movie, it's rather a depiction of characters and relationships, in which some events just happens to occur. There are many scenes that feels very random, for instance some characters passing each other on the street without noticing each other, random conversations that don't contribute much to any main story. Guess it will symbolize various things about people's relationship to each other...but I don't get the point. It just feels random and there's not much story to captivate you the whole way through. I have a hard time seeing the greatness of this movie. As usual with Kieslowski's films is the masterfully filmed and the acting is great, (but think Irene Jacob is overly low-key, feels quite unnatural). To truly love Red I think you have to be the film buff type who would blabber lustfully about how the movie is an 'insight into the true nature of human relationships', you have to think it's very interesting that characters can pass each other at times, and want to philosophize about things like 'what is the meaning of that fountain pens do not work in this film?'. I myself, would prefer a stronger story.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: Red. The last of a spectacular sequence. Red represents passion, beauty and guilt. This third movie, written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz , takes place in Gen&egrave;ve, Switzerland. Valentine (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob), a model is talking on the phone to her boyfriend, who along the movie we come to find him quite childish, that was abroad. In her way back home from a dancing lesson she runs over a dog, named Rita, which she takes immediately to the vet. Later she looks to take the dog back to its owner, who happens to be a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who's name is not given. The judge revealed himself cold and antisocial, spending is time spying or listening his neighbors phone conversations. He says he doesn't want the dog and so Valentine takes it with her. Anyway, the movie develops from here. The argument is good, not as interesting as the second but way better than the first. About the movie I would elect the Judge and the end as the best features. Another curious scene concerns the old-aged lady struggling herself to put a bottle in the bottle in the bottle bank, though this time, the main character doesn't find fun in the situation, quite the opposite since approaches her and helps. For the movie individually, 9/10. The trilogy turned out remarkably well! All of them very interconnected, created and philosophically very rich. Krzysztof Kieslowski does an amazing job as the main composer of the series. The thematic is incredibly original. I tried to relate the movies with the french flag but I've been unable to detect any sort of relation to the trilogies power-peace-bloodshed or clergy-nobility-bourgeoisie. In all of them, Krzysztof managed to shape the plot according to the color brilliantly, in such a way that made the trilogy result better than the movies themselves, because I didn't find any of them worthy of a 10/10 but the trilogy is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I also invite you to pay some attention to the little details of the trilogy: first you have the shared scenes, sometimes characters from one movie appear in another, you have presages, coincidences, etc. Curiously, the three pieces end up well, however in different ways. The first two have more in common between them than with the last one. Both start with some sort of "separation" filled with misery and depression but end up well, but not Rouge. Rouge's disaster is more subtle. Instead of developing a relationship, the characters are the ones changing. The award for best performance goes undoubtedly to Trintignant and the best movie to Bialy. Recommended!

    "I turned myself in because you wanted it and keep my dog", whispers the old judge to the woman he does not know. Red. The injured dog is going to have puppies. Please let it live. Please do not abandon the dog. Red. The whispering man keeps a collection of the stones his neighbors threw through his windows. It's is such a nice collection of minerals, the perpetrators really took care to only pick aesthetically pleasing ones, and the wind blows through the open windows. Red. "She left me for the one that could please her and I never loved again, never touched a woman again", and the wind blows banging the doors and shutters. Red. Look, can you see the paralyzed lady, she has such a hard time to throw the bottle into the container. Help her, help her! Red. Don't take the ferry. The weather is going to be sunny and calm. But, big eyed girl, don't take the ferry. Red.

    Three Colors: Red. the last of the fantastic trilogy, and i think it could be my favorite. Red is a multi-layered reflection on fate and human relations, and more than that, the film juggles with many universal themes: law vs justice, love, the parallels of individuals lives.. the performances are sublime, and i felt that Kieslowski really has a great affection for his characters, he lets them be without preaching or passing any judgement and gradually alludes to their emotional scars from the past. the musical score is lovely, it's amazing how each film has a unique timbre in music. i also think that Red is my favorite color, and in this film the color palate works greatly, visually and by psychological bearing, as Red symbolizes guilt, suffering, passion and love

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's twelfth and last feature film which he co-wrote with Polish screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, is the third and final part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and "White" (1994) and which is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. It premiered In competition at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Geneva, Switzerland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Valentin Dusot, a part-time model who one night while on her way home runs into a dog and immediately brings it to it's owner who oddly enough doesn't want anything to do with his dog. After taking the dog to the vet the following day, Valentin receives an anonymous letter which contains money. Assuming that the dog's owner might be the sender, Valentin visits him again and this time he shows her a better side of himself and invites her into his home, where she surprisingly learns that he is a retired judge who devotes his time to listening in on other people's telephone conversations. Distinctly, acutely and compassionately directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this quietly paced and deeply humane fictional tale which is narrated from the two protagonist's point of view, draws a genuinely humane and incisive portrayal of a relationship between a university student and a pensioner who after a coincidental meeting in Geneva, Switzerland finds a rare companionship. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric urban milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (1958-2001), the fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven, dialog-driven and narrative-driven drama depicts two dense and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish film score composer Zbigniew Preisner. This profoundly moving and atmospheric study in human psychology about an unconventional and life-changing friendship between two strangers which examines themes like loneliness, voyeurism, fraternity, faithfulness, interpersonal relations, love and destiny, is impelled and reinforced by it's substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog, brilliant narrative structure, multiple viewpoints and the poignant and empathic acting performances by French-born Swiss actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and French actor Jean Louis-Trintignant. A poetic, existentialistic and masterful piece of cinema which gained Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards in 1995 and, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 29th National Society Of Film Critics Awards in 1994.

    Irene Jacob, so good in The Double Life of Veronique, is equally compelling in Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski's final film. Jacob is Valentine Dusot, a model working in an ad for chewing gum. She is also a student in Geneva who argues with her possessive boyfriend in London. At the shoot for the gum, she is told to look very sad for the picture. While driving home, she gets distracted and accidentally runs over a dog. She finds the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, and he shows little concern for his dog, so she takes the doggy to the vet and then home. She also tells the judge that Rita is o.k. but pregnant. The dog runs back to Kern's house and when Valentine follows her, she catches the ex judge spying on his neighbors phone calls. She threatens to report him to the police, and he says he doesn't care, and that everyone's life eventually turns to hell. She overhears a phone call between her neighbor, Auguste, and his girlfriend, Karin, discussing a bowling date. She believes that they sound like they are in love, but Kern disagrees, telling a story of a girl he was in love with who left him and broke his heart. This event has caused him to have a cynical outlook. Auguste catches Karin cheating on him with another man, and they break up. Kern tells Valentine about a dream he had in which she was in her 50s and happily married. He advises her to take a cruise and she takes a ferry to England where characters from the first two films of the trilogy, White, and Blue, are passengers, and it is all tied together. Red is an interesting look at human nature and justice.

    "Rouge", the conclusion of Kieslowski's and screenwriter Piesecwicz's "Three Colors Trilogy", is a peculiar take on fraternity and friendship. As always with Kieslowski's works this one is about getting to know and respect the motivations of characters, learn to see the humanity in them, the hopes and aspirations they have or had and made them to what they are. It's about moral decisions and how what is presented on screen reflects our own lives and makes us reconsider once we've left the cinema. The film portrays the unlikely relationship between a young Swiss model living in Geneva (Irene Jacob) and a grumpy, cynical retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who don't seem to have much in common. After all his only enjoyment seems to be eavesdropping on his neighbors' telephone conversations, while she's got her own problems with a boyfriend, who doesn't care as much about her as she does for him. Through a struck of fate the judge and the model are brought together and while keeping a certain distance they learn to understand each other in a unique sort of way. Alas, they've missed each other romantically by a generation, as the judge says himself, but then again there's a second story paralleling the main one, and fate is pulling the strings... - or is it? "Rouge" is definitely the most accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy, as it is a love story, even though of the very different kind, and thus appeals to a larger audience than the no less brilliant "Bleu" and "Blanc". Seeing the trilogy in order is not necessary, but rewarding once you get to "Rouge" as one will discover that all these characters actually live in the same universe. Which poses the question: And you?

    One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski closes his remarkable Three Colors trilogy with Red, which is the most thematically strong of the three and also happened to be the final film of his career. Whereas Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy, Red presents itself almost as an anti-romance, as the loners Valentine (Irene Jacob) and "The Judge" (Jean-Louis Trintignant) cross paths and find a strange connection with one another. Both of these people have become isolated from most of the world. Valentine is a model and finds herself constantly on display through billboards and stage shows, but she is in a relationship with a possessive man that exists only via telephone and she has retreated away from her family which so desperately needs her support. The Judge is a former judge who has retired and now spends his days alone in his house spying on his neighbors and listening to their phone conversations. Kieslowski's trilogy has several times tapped into the dangers of modern technology and here that theme is most evident, as he explores the invasions of privacy that are currently possible (even more ominously so now, since the film was released twenty years ago). The two experience a meet cute that isn't "cute" at all, and what begins as a tense and awkward encounter soon develops into this strange relationship of two people finding something kindred in one another. As Valentine spends more time around The Judge, we discover more about who he is and what motivates him, and I found him to be quite the fascinating character. Kieslowski's exploration into voyeurism is intriguing, and it's long been one of my favorite cinematic themes, but this thematic study eventually becomes more of a character piece as The Judge opens up more to Valentine and reveals bits of his past. He's quite the tragic figure and Trintignant plays him with a closeted vulnerability that I found heartbreaking. Kieslowski introduces a lot of questions into the nature of romance, predestination and chance, all of which I found to be precise and very thought-provoking, but I think my favorite aspect of the film was the character of Valentine herself. Continuing along the journey of the trilogy, Valentine is a drastic opposition to the protagonists of the first two films. Blue's Julie Vignon had suffered unimaginable loss and was shut off from the world, retreating into herself and lashing against those who once surrounded her. White's Karol Karol was filled with bitterness and resentment, doing whatever he had to in order to meet his ultimate, devious goal. Valentine, however, was an open spirit who had deep concern for other souls and was constantly going out of her way to help others. She had a strong moral compass and a compassion that I found beautiful, as wonderfully portrayed by the open and expressive Jacob. Irene Jacob has such a warmth to her that you quickly feel for this woman and strive for everything to be alright in her world. As a model there is a photograph of her that is labeled "A Breath of Life", and this title is the perfect representation of her as a whole. She breathes life into the people she comes into contact with, even though her own life is far from perfect. The finest example of this is the recurring sequence Kieslowski uses in the trilogy of an elderly person trying to get a bottle into a recycling container. In Blue, Julie sees this woman struggling but is so shut off in her grief that she just stares, removed from the rest of the world. In White, Karol sees an old man struggling and laughs, happy in his resentment to see someone in the world worse off than he is. In Red though, Julie sees the woman struggling and helps her, pushing the bottle in for her. It's a beautiful display of what these themes, and these characters, represent. The film deals with plenty of things, but Kieslowski grounds it all in these two characters who are so refreshingly genuine, a constant aspect in the trilogy. Never does it feel like we're just watching fictional people travel along some predetermined narrative, but rather he (along with his tremendous actors) is able to make these feel like full, whole human beings and therefore anything could await them around the corner. It's a wonderful journey that all builds to a stunning finale, which once again touches on the "Breath of Life" theme in a more literal way. A strong end to an impressive trilogy.

    Three Colors: Red is Krzysztof Kieslowski's magnum opus: a grand finale that rages like a storm and drowns the viewer in amazement. Repeated viewings are required to truly 'get' and appreciate the film. My aunt saw parts of the movie and was left cold and disoriented. I myself watched it thrice before I could get a 'meaning' from the film. In terms of justifying the color and the virtue of 'brotherhood', Red outshines its predecessors Blue and White. Valentine is an aspiring model who crosses path with a retired judge one day. Both have contrasting personalities: she is naive, prudent and kind-hearted while he is distant, cynical and indifferent. Both eventually bond to form a platonic relationship that has its own consequences for both the characters. Interspersed are characters that seem to share little connection with the leads but form an integral part of the movie and its message. Roger Ebert correctly pointed out that the viewers just had to wait in anticipation for the director to paint the film in his way. Nothing in the movie is predictable; in fact everything has a touch of mystery. Some may even call term some of the situations as improbable but to me, the movie would have been banal had it not had this air of mystery. It is similar to Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which blurs the lines between reality and fiction. An important aspect in the film, which I cherished, is the connection, not only amongst human beings, but also among simple objects.
