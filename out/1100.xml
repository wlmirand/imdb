    Taking place entirely in the Soho loft of a young secretary played by the remarkable, seldom-seen Karen Silias, What Happened Was is an excursion in date torture, pitting a self-conscious paralegal (played to perfection by director/writer Tom Noonan) against Silias' lonely, easily impressed young woman. What I found most fascinating about this film's script is that it introduces two people who are not at all what they seem to be at first...and we don't know this until the film progresses. We witness their veneers slowly stripped down and they are alternately weird, ugly, frightening, and hilarious. It's an uncomfortable film to watch, especially the last third, but it's richly rewarding. The ending is plausible, appropriate, and heart-rending. Its sheer rawness is marvelous. A great ride.

    I found this film emotionally wrenching but with no catharsis. Neither of its only two characters was particularly likable and yet the film permeated and enveloped in such a way as to make it imperative to care about and root for them. Both individually and as a couple. But the rooting was not without an ambivalence. The film unfolds and draws the viewer in but it never throws out a liferope with a hint of buoyancy to cling to. The man and the woman are intriguing but each of them has very evident psychological obstacles in their makeup. Maybe insurmountable obstacles. You want things to work out for them but you have to ask yourself to what end. Their lives are each severely wanting and problematical to put it mildly but there is no indication that joining forces would in any way ease the situation. Noonan never makes it easy for the viewer. It's kind of daring and exciting to realize at the end what choices he made as a writer and as a director. The characters are without any easily accessible wit or accessible charm and yet their dialogue is fascinating. Their exchanges are agonizingly awkward and yet completely engrossing. Engrossing in a very uncomforable sort of way. The discomfort was probably because it rang so raw and without any tarting up. I longed for more theatricality in the delivery of the lines. That would have provided an emotional distance and made it easier to take the film. But I have to admire Noonan for not choosing that route as a director. By going completely naturalistic, there was no barrier, nothing to shield you from the film's impact. I wish Noonan had chosen to end the film differently, though. I wish there had been more of a glimmer of hope. Although it's beyond presumptuous to discuss changes to the script, I wish that Noonan had ended the film with the Jackie character giving a different response to the Michael character's invitation to go out with him Friday night. Rather than responding that he should ask her again when they saw each other at work (accompanied by an expression on her face indicating that she had already lost complete interest in him), I wish she had instead said that she would be glad to have dinner with him if it could be a celebratory dinner. It would be conditional. That when he had finished making the preliminary arrangements to complete the credits for his law degree, she would be glad to join him for dinner. And that would be only a small indication of the kind of congratulatory blowout she would plan for him after he had gone on to pass the bar exam. And if Michael had also in turn given some reciprocal show of support to Jackie. She had no writing talent but judging from her apartment, she had creativity and a good eye. There was promise there. Promise to be encouraged. I guess I just wanted to believe that there was some small glimmer of hope that they could help rescue each other. But instead the ending was relentlessly and piercingly grim. Well worth seeing, though! The acting was brilliant, the set design, the cinematography, the music, all exceptional. And the last shot of all the buildings and all the apartment windows was very powerful carrying as it did the message that behind each window was more drama.

    Tom Noonan and Karen Sillas portray a disaffected NYC couple- co-workers who are now on a dinner date. Tom Noonan is somewhat menacing and unpredictable. Interesting presence. (You may recall him from "Manhunter"). Basically, the film develops as the two discuss their jobs(which they hate) but they have other projects in the works, Sillas published a children's book. Tom Noonan portrays an Ivy League graduate, working as a paralegal who is both amused and disgusted by the attorneys at the firm. He is defensive about why he works at said firm, and Sillas finds him interesting, saying he must have some grand plan to get revenge on the attorneys at the firm. The only somewhat nebulous plot point is where Sillas reads the "children's book" she has written, which turns out to be quite violent. I will not spoil it for those who have not yet seen this movie, but suffice it to say, it is very strange. All in all an entertaining film, about alienation and dating in NYC, which has a creative distinction- it is one film in the past ten years that does NOT try to imitate Woody Allen!. 8/10

    I can not believe how absolutely idiotic some of the people who waste their time and ours are writing their rubbish for IMDb. They're completely myopic. Go somewhere else and spew your nonsense! This movie is wonderful..its only flaw is that it was too short. I could have watched these characters navigate through this first "date" another hour. The only scene that didn't draw me in as much, though at least served as some sort of bridge to reveal that Jackie actually accomplished something that her date hasn't (yet? perhaps, but unlikely), is the one in which she read her story. I didn't like the story at all, though it may have tried to reveal that her character had some painful memories in her life to work out...we don't really know. Nonetheless, I loved this film. The awkwardness in the beginning of their conversation, after he first arrives at her apartment, especially on her part, and the revelation at the end of his character were both very touching. Moreover, I loved the ending. ***Spoiler to come*** Once he unleashes his burden by revealing what he does reveal about himself to her, he is ready to continue their conversation, more or less, and ask her out on a second date. I loved her reaction, in turn. They're both hurt, lonely people, and want to tread cautiously with this relationship, each at different points in the film. I very highly recommend this film if you're interested in delving into a character's psyche. If you need a loud soundtrack, goo-goo eyes, and a really happy ending, this is not the film for you. It takes place in one apartment the entire length of the film (and I love the apartment, its blue hues and its simplicity of design, even though it is really small...you just imagine her small lonely life, but sort of marvel that she gets up every morning and goes to work every day, and keeps afloat). The music used in the opening and at the end is great as well, which Tom Noonan composed. I wish I could find the soundtrack. It's a great little film that I've been watching very frequently lately. I only wish it were longer. Or, maybe Noonan should do what Ethan Hawke did with Before Sunrise, and make a sequel, ten years later. Do these characters still work at the same firm? Are they dating? Do they have separate lives altogether but happen to run into each other one day? Does he salvage himself to any degree? I'd love to see each of their stories and how they may or may not intertwine again.

    I can't say if it is a good or bad movie, but what I believe is that it is a real life movie: I must know it, it describes what many of us have lived in real life, actually, it is a mirror image of many lives. I do not mean by that I am some dysfunctional guy, but everybody has a little of that. You should watch it; it is possible that you may find yourself re-living some personal experience. It is not a typical Hollywood movie, it is a rather practical and real life experience that as you watch you begin feeling as if some knew about you and made it a movie. I watched this movie with my wife and she kept on joking about how similar the story was with our first dates.

    What Happened Was is a movie of creepy intensity that is both affecting and disturbing. Talented writer/director/actor Tom Noonan allows the viewer to be a fly on the wall for a first date that starts off awkward and painful and then veers into the uncomfortably intimate. Michael and Jackie could be anyone you work with, pass every day in the hall, and never realize what's going on in their strange inner worlds. Lonely and simultaneously starved for meaningful human companionship and afraid of it, by the end of the date Michael and Jackie reveal themselves in ways that are real and fascinating while also being scary in a way that few movies are. A must see for anyone interested in the dark recesses of the human mind.

    I watched this movie the other night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, you must be in the proper mood to enjoy a movie such as this. This movie centers around 2 lonely characters, man and woman, on a 'first' date at the woman's apartment. This movie is not too funny nor is it fast paced. The movie simply tries to flesh out each person's character for 90 minutes. This movie also led to some candid discussion between my fianc&eacute; and I, especially about the man's 'troubles' at the end of the film. We also discussed if there would be a 'second' date between them. The movie is steeped in realism and is shot very well. Worth a look if you're in the proper mood for a slow but interesting, character development story. 6 out of 10.

    ***SPOILERS*** " What Happened Was" is a story about hurt and loneliness in the big city and how it effects two people Michael & Jackie Tom Noonan & Karen Sillas, who are co-workers at a big NYC law firm. Michael is a paralegal and Jackie is an executive assistant as they both spend what at first seems to be a quite evening dinner at Jackie's apartment that leads to an emotional explosion which exposes the mask that they've been wearing at their job all these years. Jackie really likes Michael very much and finds in him the reason for her to get up every morning and go to work. Single like Michael she as well as him want to have a relationship to put a wedge between the loneliness that they both feel but living as they do in a major modern metropolis in a way forces them not to be themselves. Michael is far more deluded then Jackie, who's more down to earth and honest about herself, in him thinking that he's a big time social activist who's writing a book, that he tells Jackie took him fifteen years to write, about the law profession and how it hurts those that it deals with. Michael in fact is really a very insecure young man afraid of facing life and thus losing himself in a fantasy world that he created for himself inside his living room watching TV shows mostly on the Discovery Channel. It comes as a great shock to Michael's ego when Jackie shows him a children book that she wrote that was published unlike his imaginary work on social injustice. Throughout the entire film Jackie does what she can to loosen Michael up, with almost an entire bottle of wine, and in the end he does seem to come out of his shell and really starts to get it on with Jackie. Still his insecurity keeps him from really being responsive to her feelings about him and it's that reaction that leaves Jackie in tears as she feels she made a fool of herself trying to get Michael to fall in love with her like she's with him. Michael is finally brought down to earth when he realizes how he hurt Jackie with his overwhelming sense of self-importance. Michael's clumsy attempt to make things right after he tried to leave her just as Jackie thought he would stay over night left her with a sense of outraged. It's then that she tells Michael just what she thought of him, this after how she felt all this time about him, and how he was the only person to make her happy in the office that they both worked at. That revelation by Jackie hit Michael so hard that for once he opens up to her and is honest about himself, not at first realizing her feelings that she had for him, and tries to make amends for what he, unconsciously, put her through that evening. Heart-felt and moving film about how people have trouble connecting with each other and how two people who worked and were friends for years at the job together are like fish out of water and strangers when they meet and try to start up a serious relationship out of the workplace.

    this is a wonderfully emotional film with truly authentic characters and a gripping climax. exactly what film-making should be: two people in a room, an intro, a plot point, a midpoint, a second plot point and the outro where everything is the exact reverse from what it was in the beginning. a lesson in storytelling. naturally, the location is less than exciting, it literally all plays in a room, but then aren't these production limits exactly what seems to continuously spark enormous creativity? I watched this on charlie kaufman's recommendation (uh, from an interview), so take it from him. 10/10

    I really loved this movie. The situation is easy to relate to, at least at the beginning. These two office workers are lonely and want to find someone, but each is struggling with "how to begin" and "what to reveal." I laughed at each of the characters and felt sorrow for each of them as well. The climax, I believe, is her monologue about the children's book she is writing. She delivers a fine performance, and Mr. Noonan's response is perhaps that of the audience. I shifted in my seat, peering into a soul perverted by anxiety and solitude. In one final coup, however, Noonan leaves us hanging, with the man more interested in trying again than the woman. Nice. I was never bored with this film, not once.

Still his insecurity keeps him from really being responsive to her feelings about him and it's that reaction that leaves Jackie in tears as she feels she made a fool of herself trying to get Michael to fall in love with her like she's with him. Michael is finally brought down to earth when he realizes how he hurt Jackie with his overwhelming sense of self-importance. Michael's clumsy attempt to make things right after he tried to leave her just as Jackie thought he would stay over night left her with a sense of outraged. It's then that she tells Michael just what she thought of him, this after how she felt all this time about him, and how he was the only person to make her happy in the office that they both worked at. That revelation by Jackie hit Michael so hard that for once he opens up to her and is honest about himself, not at first realizing her feelings that she had for him, and tries to make amends for what he, unconsciously, put her through that evening. Heart-felt and moving film about how people have trouble connecting with each other and how two people who worked and were friends for years at the job together are like fish out of water and strangers when they meet and try to start up a serious relationship out of the workplace.

    this is a wonderfully emotional film with truly authentic characters and a gripping climax. exactly what film-making should be: two people in a room, an intro, a plot point, a midpoint, a second plot point and the outro where everything is the exact reverse from what it was in the beginning. a lesson in storytelling. naturally, the location is less than exciting, it literally all plays in a room, but then aren't these production limits exactly what seems to continuously spark enormous creativity? I watched this on charlie kaufman's recommendation (uh, from an interview), so take it from him. 10/10

    I really loved this movie. The situation is easy to relate to, at least at the beginning. These two office workers are lonely and want to find someone, but each is struggling with "how to begin" and "what to reveal." I laughed at each of the characters and felt sorrow for each of them as well. The climax, I believe, is her monologue about the children's book she is writing. She delivers a fine performance, and Mr. Noonan's response is perhaps that of the audience. I shifted in my seat, peering into a soul perverted by anxiety and solitude. In one final coup, however, Noonan leaves us hanging, with the man more interested in trying again than the woman. Nice. I was never bored with this film, not once.

    Taking place entirely in the Soho loft of a young secretary played by the remarkable, seldom-seen Karen Silias, What Happened Was is an excursion in date torture, pitting a self-conscious paralegal (played to perfection by director/writer Tom Noonan) against Silias' lonely, easily impressed young woman. What I found most fascinating about this film's script is that it introduces two people who are not at all what they seem to be at first...and we don't know this until the film progresses. We witness their veneers slowly stripped down and they are alternately weird, ugly, frightening, and hilarious. It's an uncomfortable film to watch, especially the last third, but it's richly rewarding. The ending is plausible, appropriate, and heart-rending. Its sheer rawness is marvelous. A great ride.

    I found this film emotionally wrenching but with no catharsis. Neither of its only two characters was particularly likable and yet the film permeated and enveloped in such a way as to make it imperative to care about and root for them. Both individually and as a couple. But the rooting was not without an ambivalence. The film unfolds and draws the viewer in but it never throws out a liferope with a hint of buoyancy to cling to. The man and the woman are intriguing but each of them has very evident psychological obstacles in their makeup. Maybe insurmountable obstacles. You want things to work out for them but you have to ask yourself to what end. Their lives are each severely wanting and problematical to put it mildly but there is no indication that joining forces would in any way ease the situation. Noonan never makes it easy for the viewer. It's kind of daring and exciting to realize at the end what choices he made as a writer and as a director. The characters are without any easily accessible wit or accessible charm and yet their dialogue is fascinating. Their exchanges are agonizingly awkward and yet completely engrossing. Engrossing in a very uncomforable sort of way. The discomfort was probably because it rang so raw and without any tarting up. I longed for more theatricality in the delivery of the lines. That would have provided an emotional distance and made it easier to take the film. But I have to admire Noonan for not choosing that route as a director. By going completely naturalistic, there was no barrier, nothing to shield you from the film's impact. I wish Noonan had chosen to end the film differently, though. I wish there had been more of a glimmer of hope. Although it's beyond presumptuous to discuss changes to the script, I wish that Noonan had ended the film with the Jackie character giving a different response to the Michael character's invitation to go out with him Friday night. Rather than responding that he should ask her again when they saw each other at work (accompanied by an expression on her face indicating that she had already lost complete interest in him), I wish she had instead said that she would be glad to have dinner with him if it could be a celebratory dinner. It would be conditional. That when he had finished making the preliminary arrangements to complete the credits for his law degree, she would be glad to join him for dinner. And that would be only a small indication of the kind of congratulatory blowout she would plan for him after he had gone on to pass the bar exam. And if Michael had also in turn given some reciprocal show of support to Jackie. She had no writing talent but judging from her apartment, she had creativity and a good eye. There was promise there. Promise to be encouraged. I guess I just wanted to believe that there was some small glimmer of hope that they could help rescue each other. But instead the ending was relentlessly and piercingly grim. Well worth seeing, though! The acting was brilliant, the set design, the cinematography, the music, all exceptional. And the last shot of all the buildings and all the apartment windows was very powerful carrying as it did the message that behind each window was more drama.

    Tom Noonan and Karen Sillas portray a disaffected NYC couple- co-workers who are now on a dinner date. Tom Noonan is somewhat menacing and unpredictable. Interesting presence. (You may recall him from "Manhunter"). Basically, the film develops as the two discuss their jobs(which they hate) but they have other projects in the works, Sillas published a children's book. Tom Noonan portrays an Ivy League graduate, working as a paralegal who is both amused and disgusted by the attorneys at the firm. He is defensive about why he works at said firm, and Sillas finds him interesting, saying he must have some grand plan to get revenge on the attorneys at the firm. The only somewhat nebulous plot point is where Sillas reads the "children's book" she has written, which turns out to be quite violent. I will not spoil it for those who have not yet seen this movie, but suffice it to say, it is very strange. All in all an entertaining film, about alienation and dating in NYC, which has a creative distinction- it is one film in the past ten years that does NOT try to imitate Woody Allen!. 8/10

    I can not believe how absolutely idiotic some of the people who waste their time and ours are writing their rubbish for IMDb. They're completely myopic. Go somewhere else and spew your nonsense! This movie is wonderful..its only flaw is that it was too short. I could have watched these characters navigate through this first "date" another hour. The only scene that didn't draw me in as much, though at least served as some sort of bridge to reveal that Jackie actually accomplished something that her date hasn't (yet? perhaps, but unlikely), is the one in which she read her story. I didn't like the story at all, though it may have tried to reveal that her character had some painful memories in her life to work out...we don't really know. Nonetheless, I loved this film. The awkwardness in the beginning of their conversation, after he first arrives at her apartment, especially on her part, and the revelation at the end of his character were both very touching. Moreover, I loved the ending. ***Spoiler to come*** Once he unleashes his burden by revealing what he does reveal about himself to her, he is ready to continue their conversation, more or less, and ask her out on a second date. I loved her reaction, in turn. They're both hurt, lonely people, and want to tread cautiously with this relationship, each at different points in the film. I very highly recommend this film if you're interested in delving into a character's psyche. If you need a loud soundtrack, goo-goo eyes, and a really happy ending, this is not the film for you. It takes place in one apartment the entire length of the film (and I love the apartment, its blue hues and its simplicity of design, even though it is really small...you just imagine her small lonely life, but sort of marvel that she gets up every morning and goes to work every day, and keeps afloat). The music used in the opening and at the end is great as well, which Tom Noonan composed. I wish I could find the soundtrack. It's a great little film that I've been watching very frequently lately. I only wish it were longer. Or, maybe Noonan should do what Ethan Hawke did with Before Sunrise, and make a sequel, ten years later. Do these characters still work at the same firm? Are they dating? Do they have separate lives altogether but happen to run into each other one day? Does he salvage himself to any degree? I'd love to see each of their stories and how they may or may not intertwine again.

    I can't say if it is a good or bad movie, but what I believe is that it is a real life movie: I must know it, it describes what many of us have lived in real life, actually, it is a mirror image of many lives. I do not mean by that I am some dysfunctional guy, but everybody has a little of that. You should watch it; it is possible that you may find yourself re-living some personal experience. It is not a typical Hollywood movie, it is a rather practical and real life experience that as you watch you begin feeling as if some knew about you and made it a movie. I watched this movie with my wife and she kept on joking about how similar the story was with our first dates.

    What Happened Was is a movie of creepy intensity that is both affecting and disturbing. Talented writer/director/actor Tom Noonan allows the viewer to be a fly on the wall for a first date that starts off awkward and painful and then veers into the uncomfortably intimate. Michael and Jackie could be anyone you work with, pass every day in the hall, and never realize what's going on in their strange inner worlds. Lonely and simultaneously starved for meaningful human companionship and afraid of it, by the end of the date Michael and Jackie reveal themselves in ways that are real and fascinating while also being scary in a way that few movies are. A must see for anyone interested in the dark recesses of the human mind.

    I watched this movie the other night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, you must be in the proper mood to enjoy a movie such as this. This movie centers around 2 lonely characters, man and woman, on a 'first' date at the woman's apartment. This movie is not too funny nor is it fast paced. The movie simply tries to flesh out each person's character for 90 minutes. This movie also led to some candid discussion between my fianc&eacute; and I, especially about the man's 'troubles' at the end of the film. We also discussed if there would be a 'second' date between them. The movie is steeped in realism and is shot very well. Worth a look if you're in the proper mood for a slow but interesting, character development story. 6 out of 10.

    ***SPOILERS*** " What Happened Was" is a story about hurt and loneliness in the big city and how it effects two people Michael & Jackie Tom Noonan & Karen Sillas, who are co-workers at a big NYC law firm. Michael is a paralegal and Jackie is an executive assistant as they both spend what at first seems to be a quite evening dinner at Jackie's apartment that leads to an emotional explosion which exposes the mask that they've been wearing at their job all these years. Jackie really likes Michael very much and finds in him the reason for her to get up every morning and go to work. Single like Michael she as well as him want to have a relationship to put a wedge between the loneliness that they both feel but living as they do in a major modern metropolis in a way forces them not to be themselves. Michael is far more deluded then Jackie, who's more down to earth and honest about herself, in him thinking that he's a big time social activist who's writing a book, that he tells Jackie took him fifteen years to write, about the law profession and how it hurts those that it deals with. Michael in fact is really a very insecure young man afraid of facing life and thus losing himself in a fantasy world that he created for himself inside his living room watching TV shows mostly on the Discovery Channel. It comes as a great shock to Michael's ego when Jackie shows him a children book that she wrote that was published unlike his imaginary work on social injustice. Throughout the entire film Jackie does what she can to loosen Michael up, with almost an entire bottle of wine, and in the end he does seem to come out of his shell and really starts to get it on with Jackie. Still his insecurity keeps him from really being responsive to her feelings about him and it's that reaction that leaves Jackie in tears as she feels she made a fool of herself trying to get Michael to fall in love with her like she's with him. Michael is finally brought down to earth when he realizes how he hurt Jackie with his overwhelming sense of self-importance.

That revelation by Jackie hit Michael so hard that for once he opens up to her and is honest about himself, not at first realizing her feelings that she had for him, and tries to make amends for what he, unconsciously, put her through that evening. Heart-felt and moving film about how people have trouble connecting with each other and how two people who worked and were friends for years at the job together are like fish out of water and strangers when they meet and try to start up a serious relationship out of the workplace.

Michael is a paralegal and Jackie is an executive assistant as they both spend what at first seems to be a quite evening dinner at Jackie's apartment that leads to an emotional explosion which exposes the mask that they've been wearing at their job all these years. Jackie really likes Michael very much and finds in him the reason for her to get up every morning and go to work. Single like Michael she as well as him want to have a relationship to put a wedge between the loneliness that they both feel but living as they do in a major modern metropolis in a way forces them not to be themselves. Michael is far more deluded then Jackie, who's more down to earth and honest about herself, in him thinking that he's a big time social activist who's writing a book, that he tells Jackie took him fifteen years to write, about the law profession and how it hurts those that it deals with. Michael in fact is really a very insecure young man afraid of facing life and thus losing himself in a fantasy world that he created for himself inside his living room watching TV shows mostly on the Discovery Channel. It comes as a great shock to Michael's ego when Jackie shows him a children book that she wrote that was published unlike his imaginary work on social injustice. Throughout the entire film Jackie does what she can to loosen Michael up, with almost an entire bottle of wine, and in the end he does seem to come out of his shell and really starts to get it on with Jackie. Still his insecurity keeps him from really being responsive to her feelings about him and it's that reaction that leaves Jackie in tears as she feels she made a fool of herself trying to get Michael to fall in love with her like she's with him. Michael is finally brought down to earth when he realizes how he hurt Jackie with his overwhelming sense of self-importance. Michael's clumsy attempt to make things right after he tried to leave her just as Jackie thought he would stay over night left her with a sense of outraged. It's then that she tells Michael just what she thought of him, this after how she felt all this time about him, and how he was the only person to make her happy in the office that they both worked at. That revelation by Jackie hit Michael so hard that for once he opens up to her and is honest about himself, not at first realizing her feelings that she had for him, and tries to make amends for what he, unconsciously, put her through that evening. Heart-felt and moving film about how people have trouble connecting with each other and how two people who worked and were friends for years at the job together are like fish out of water and strangers when they meet and try to start up a serious relationship out of the workplace.

    this is a wonderfully emotional film with truly authentic characters and a gripping climax. exactly what film-making should be: two people in a room, an intro, a plot point, a midpoint, a second plot point and the outro where everything is the exact reverse from what it was in the beginning. a lesson in storytelling. naturally, the location is less than exciting, it literally all plays in a room, but then aren't these production limits exactly what seems to continuously spark enormous creativity? I watched this on charlie kaufman's recommendation (uh, from an interview), so take it from him. 10/10

    I really loved this movie. The situation is easy to relate to, at least at the beginning. These two office workers are lonely and want to find someone, but each is struggling with "how to begin" and "what to reveal." I laughed at each of the characters and felt sorrow for each of them as well. The climax, I believe, is her monologue about the children's book she is writing. She delivers a fine performance, and Mr. Noonan's response is perhaps that of the audience. I shifted in my seat, peering into a soul perverted by anxiety and solitude. In one final coup, however, Noonan leaves us hanging, with the man more interested in trying again than the woman. Nice. I was never bored with this film, not once.
