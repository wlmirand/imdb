 <sinopse>
  Tom Ripley is a talented mimic, moocher, forger and all-around criminal improviser; but there's more to Tom Ripley than even he can guess.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Tom Ripley is sent to Europe by Mr. Greenleaf to fetch his spoiled, playboy son, Philippe, and bring him back home to the States. In return, Tom will receive $5,000. Philippe toys with Tom, pretending he will go back home, but has no intentions of leaving his bride to be, Marge, and honoring his father's wishes. After some time passes, Mr. Greenleaf considers the mission a failure and cuts Tom off. Tom, in desperation, kills Philippe, assumes his identity, and lives the life of a rich playboy. However, he will need all his conman abilities to keep Philippe's friends and the police off the trail.

    In films like "L'Atalante" (1934), "Der Blaue Engel" (1930) and "Fa yeung nin wa" (2000) it's imperative that the audience falls in love with the women the camera loves. In "Plein soleil" (1960) the means is quite similar: for us to become part of the film, partners in crime, we have to invest in Deloin's Ripley, and to do so we have to fall in love with him, become dependent on him, be seduced by him just like all the characters are seduced by him. The film, for me, is thus summarized in the card game on deck: the risk is known to both parties yet it's exactly the risk that makes it worth it. The film, then, plays cards at us the whole time, the knife under its thigh, and we love it for it. Deloin, of course, is beyond superb. The nerve, the distance, the excitement, all of this in his eyes, out of breath. Cl&eacute;ment's pacing is intimate, even cunning, and I love seeing Italy through his eyes. He builds suspense masterfully, and when the police visit Ripley at the hotel for the second time I gasped out loud at the moment when the cupboard door opened. These kinds of moments sneakily come and go, the whole balanced, believable enough to offer chills and make us accomplices.

    This modest French film from 1960 has dated quite badly compared to the nouvelle vague offerings that came out at the same time. The static camera work, elaborate sets and stilted, formal acting must have already seemed quite tired by the time it reached the cinema and the intervening years have not been kind. It feels, in many ways like a French attempt to do a Steve McQueen-style Hollywood film. Despite the dated style, this remains an effective character study of a sociopath. Delon's villain is amoral and lacking in any visible trace of compassion as he murders his friend and seeks to take control of his fortune only to be undone by his own arrogance and sloppiness. The transitions from playfulness to murderousness to fear are well-handled and one gains an insight into his shallow, greed-driven world. The bright colour photography unfortunately contrasts with the dark, brooding nature of the tale, further undermining the story. There is little innovation in the editing and the minor characters, such as the female love interest, are little more than ciphers. One cannot help but feel that this story, based on an American novel, has lost something in its transition between cultures. With better direction and a little more thought, this could have become a classic. Instead it feels like a strange dinosaur, caught between the old and the new.

    When I got this film, I had no idea that it was later remade as the Mr. Ripley films in the US. Now I have not yet seen any of them--but after seeing "Purple Noon" I am much more inclined to seek them out in the near future. This is because the film is so intelligently written--darn clever and quite original. Tom Ripley appears to be a mouse of a man. He's been sent to retrieve an American playboy back to the States, but with no luck. So instead, he hangs with this spoiled rich guy as he wanders through Europe having a good time. During these travels, the rich guy keeps treating Ripley like dirt--and enjoys seeing just how far he can push him. As for Ripley (Alan Delon), you are hoping that he does SOMETHING to stand up for himself. Unfortunately, this means killing the rich guy and assuming his identity! Now you think that this plan is really flawed--after all, how long can he pretend to be this rich guy and spend his money. BUT, this is NOT Ripley's plan--it's much more complicated and intelligent than that. Tune in to see the plan unfold. What I liked about this scenario is that HOW and WHAT Ripley did really worked well. It's NOT the half-baked plan it seems to be and was fascinating throughout. In addition, Delon, who is a fine actor, is really good in this role. Well worth seeing and one of the better films I've seen in recent weeks--and I watch A LOT of films!

    I saw this gem again last night after seeing "The talented Mr. Ripley" a few months ago, and with all my admiration for the excellent art direction in the Minguella film, Rene Clement's is far much better even with the liberties it takes with the novel's original plot. Its visual stylishness and the music score, and mostly Alain Delon's cool, cold-blooded and totally amoral character are the best things in this gorgeous-looking movie. About the 1999 version I have to say that Matt Damon's Ripley remains closer to Highsmith's conception of the character. But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book: loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in "Plein Soleil" is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time: Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s: visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come: "Charade", "Topkapi", James Bond... And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images: a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

    Alain Delon stars as Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon," an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley." There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow, which I didn't care for. Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending, which differs from her book, the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley, and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave, charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matin&eacute;e idols, really at the height of his fabulous looks here. Unlike the Minghella version, which I found preposterous, this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director, and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge (Marie Laforet) is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual. I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's. One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film, which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it, it was easier to take in this film. Like the Minghella version, Purple Noon is glorious to look at, with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.

    Purple Noon (1960) It might be hard to see "Purple Noon" with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 "The Talented Mr. Ripley." But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier "Purple Noon" is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie. But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that "which is better" comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the "talented" Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head. Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon. There are some weird flaws in "Purple Noon." One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In "Purple Noon" the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it. Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes "Purple Noon" more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. "Purple Noon" does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake. Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing "New Wave" era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

    I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Purple Noon, the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension. The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him. The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings: in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Cl&eacute;m&eacute;nt shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder. Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl. The character of Marge (Marie Lafor&ecirc;t) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafor&ecirc;t doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone. Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him. Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Cl&eacute;ment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca&euml;, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Cl&eacute;ment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man. I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is: a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

    Sun-swept adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel "Monsieur Ripley" involves two French playboys in Rome--one a millionaire's son, the other a ne'er-do-well who worships money and the people who have it--who come to an impasse at sea, resulting in tragedy and an elaborate cover-up. Hitchcockian drama presents a whirlpool of murder and deceit in exquisitely beautiful visual terms, with luscious color cinematography and locations. Like Alfred Hitchcock, director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in the How rather than the Why; the film doesn't run so much on emotion as it does on a rather far-fetched level of logic (though the final twist is really pressing things). The film's American counterpart, 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", played up the thriller aspects of Highsmith's story, while Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in letting the scenes unfold through careful pacing and detail. It's often extraordinary--and, by the end, extraordinarily empty. **1/2 from ****

    Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

    Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.

About the 1999 version I have to say that Matt Damon's Ripley remains closer to Highsmith's conception of the character. But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book: loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in "Plein Soleil" is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time: Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s: visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come: "Charade", "Topkapi", James Bond... And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images: a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

    Alain Delon stars as Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon," an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley." There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow, which I didn't care for. Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending, which differs from her book, the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley, and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave, charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matin&eacute;e idols, really at the height of his fabulous looks here. Unlike the Minghella version, which I found preposterous, this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director, and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge (Marie Laforet) is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual. I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's. One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film, which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it, it was easier to take in this film. Like the Minghella version, Purple Noon is glorious to look at, with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.

    Purple Noon (1960) It might be hard to see "Purple Noon" with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 "The Talented Mr. Ripley." But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier "Purple Noon" is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie. But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that "which is better" comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the "talented" Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head. Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon. There are some weird flaws in "Purple Noon." One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In "Purple Noon" the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it. Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes "Purple Noon" more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. "Purple Noon" does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake. Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing "New Wave" era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

    I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Purple Noon, the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension. The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him. The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings: in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Cl&eacute;m&eacute;nt shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder. Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl. The character of Marge (Marie Lafor&ecirc;t) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafor&ecirc;t doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone. Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him. Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Cl&eacute;ment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca&euml;, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Cl&eacute;ment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man. I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is: a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

    Sun-swept adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel "Monsieur Ripley" involves two French playboys in Rome--one a millionaire's son, the other a ne'er-do-well who worships money and the people who have it--who come to an impasse at sea, resulting in tragedy and an elaborate cover-up. Hitchcockian drama presents a whirlpool of murder and deceit in exquisitely beautiful visual terms, with luscious color cinematography and locations. Like Alfred Hitchcock, director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in the How rather than the Why; the film doesn't run so much on emotion as it does on a rather far-fetched level of logic (though the final twist is really pressing things). The film's American counterpart, 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", played up the thriller aspects of Highsmith's story, while Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in letting the scenes unfold through careful pacing and detail. It's often extraordinary--and, by the end, extraordinarily empty. **1/2 from ****

    Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

    Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.

    In films like "L'Atalante" (1934), "Der Blaue Engel" (1930) and "Fa yeung nin wa" (2000) it's imperative that the audience falls in love with the women the camera loves. In "Plein soleil" (1960) the means is quite similar: for us to become part of the film, partners in crime, we have to invest in Deloin's Ripley, and to do so we have to fall in love with him, become dependent on him, be seduced by him just like all the characters are seduced by him. The film, for me, is thus summarized in the card game on deck: the risk is known to both parties yet it's exactly the risk that makes it worth it. The film, then, plays cards at us the whole time, the knife under its thigh, and we love it for it. Deloin, of course, is beyond superb. The nerve, the distance, the excitement, all of this in his eyes, out of breath. Cl&eacute;ment's pacing is intimate, even cunning, and I love seeing Italy through his eyes. He builds suspense masterfully, and when the police visit Ripley at the hotel for the second time I gasped out loud at the moment when the cupboard door opened. These kinds of moments sneakily come and go, the whole balanced, believable enough to offer chills and make us accomplices.

    This modest French film from 1960 has dated quite badly compared to the nouvelle vague offerings that came out at the same time. The static camera work, elaborate sets and stilted, formal acting must have already seemed quite tired by the time it reached the cinema and the intervening years have not been kind. It feels, in many ways like a French attempt to do a Steve McQueen-style Hollywood film. Despite the dated style, this remains an effective character study of a sociopath. Delon's villain is amoral and lacking in any visible trace of compassion as he murders his friend and seeks to take control of his fortune only to be undone by his own arrogance and sloppiness. The transitions from playfulness to murderousness to fear are well-handled and one gains an insight into his shallow, greed-driven world. The bright colour photography unfortunately contrasts with the dark, brooding nature of the tale, further undermining the story. There is little innovation in the editing and the minor characters, such as the female love interest, are little more than ciphers. One cannot help but feel that this story, based on an American novel, has lost something in its transition between cultures. With better direction and a little more thought, this could have become a classic. Instead it feels like a strange dinosaur, caught between the old and the new.

    When I got this film, I had no idea that it was later remade as the Mr. Ripley films in the US. Now I have not yet seen any of them--but after seeing "Purple Noon" I am much more inclined to seek them out in the near future. This is because the film is so intelligently written--darn clever and quite original. Tom Ripley appears to be a mouse of a man. He's been sent to retrieve an American playboy back to the States, but with no luck. So instead, he hangs with this spoiled rich guy as he wanders through Europe having a good time. During these travels, the rich guy keeps treating Ripley like dirt--and enjoys seeing just how far he can push him. As for Ripley (Alan Delon), you are hoping that he does SOMETHING to stand up for himself. Unfortunately, this means killing the rich guy and assuming his identity! Now you think that this plan is really flawed--after all, how long can he pretend to be this rich guy and spend his money. BUT, this is NOT Ripley's plan--it's much more complicated and intelligent than that. Tune in to see the plan unfold. What I liked about this scenario is that HOW and WHAT Ripley did really worked well. It's NOT the half-baked plan it seems to be and was fascinating throughout. In addition, Delon, who is a fine actor, is really good in this role. Well worth seeing and one of the better films I've seen in recent weeks--and I watch A LOT of films!

    I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Purple Noon, the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension. The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him. The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings: in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Cl&eacute;m&eacute;nt shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder. Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl. The character of Marge (Marie Lafor&ecirc;t) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafor&ecirc;t doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone. Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him. Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Cl&eacute;ment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca&euml;, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Cl&eacute;ment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man. I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is: a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

    Sun-swept adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel "Monsieur Ripley" involves two French playboys in Rome--one a millionaire's son, the other a ne'er-do-well who worships money and the people who have it--who come to an impasse at sea, resulting in tragedy and an elaborate cover-up. Hitchcockian drama presents a whirlpool of murder and deceit in exquisitely beautiful visual terms, with luscious color cinematography and locations. Like Alfred Hitchcock, director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in the How rather than the Why; the film doesn't run so much on emotion as it does on a rather far-fetched level of logic (though the final twist is really pressing things). The film's American counterpart, 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", played up the thriller aspects of Highsmith's story, while Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in letting the scenes unfold through careful pacing and detail. It's often extraordinary--and, by the end, extraordinarily empty. **1/2 from ****

    Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

    Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.

    In films like "L'Atalante" (1934), "Der Blaue Engel" (1930) and "Fa yeung nin wa" (2000) it's imperative that the audience falls in love with the women the camera loves. In "Plein soleil" (1960) the means is quite similar: for us to become part of the film, partners in crime, we have to invest in Deloin's Ripley, and to do so we have to fall in love with him, become dependent on him, be seduced by him just like all the characters are seduced by him. The film, for me, is thus summarized in the card game on deck: the risk is known to both parties yet it's exactly the risk that makes it worth it. The film, then, plays cards at us the whole time, the knife under its thigh, and we love it for it. Deloin, of course, is beyond superb. The nerve, the distance, the excitement, all of this in his eyes, out of breath. Cl&eacute;ment's pacing is intimate, even cunning, and I love seeing Italy through his eyes. He builds suspense masterfully, and when the police visit Ripley at the hotel for the second time I gasped out loud at the moment when the cupboard door opened. These kinds of moments sneakily come and go, the whole balanced, believable enough to offer chills and make us accomplices.

    This modest French film from 1960 has dated quite badly compared to the nouvelle vague offerings that came out at the same time. The static camera work, elaborate sets and stilted, formal acting must have already seemed quite tired by the time it reached the cinema and the intervening years have not been kind. It feels, in many ways like a French attempt to do a Steve McQueen-style Hollywood film. Despite the dated style, this remains an effective character study of a sociopath. Delon's villain is amoral and lacking in any visible trace of compassion as he murders his friend and seeks to take control of his fortune only to be undone by his own arrogance and sloppiness. The transitions from playfulness to murderousness to fear are well-handled and one gains an insight into his shallow, greed-driven world. The bright colour photography unfortunately contrasts with the dark, brooding nature of the tale, further undermining the story. There is little innovation in the editing and the minor characters, such as the female love interest, are little more than ciphers. One cannot help but feel that this story, based on an American novel, has lost something in its transition between cultures. With better direction and a little more thought, this could have become a classic. Instead it feels like a strange dinosaur, caught between the old and the new.

    When I got this film, I had no idea that it was later remade as the Mr. Ripley films in the US. Now I have not yet seen any of them--but after seeing "Purple Noon" I am much more inclined to seek them out in the near future. This is because the film is so intelligently written--darn clever and quite original. Tom Ripley appears to be a mouse of a man. He's been sent to retrieve an American playboy back to the States, but with no luck. So instead, he hangs with this spoiled rich guy as he wanders through Europe having a good time. During these travels, the rich guy keeps treating Ripley like dirt--and enjoys seeing just how far he can push him. As for Ripley (Alan Delon), you are hoping that he does SOMETHING to stand up for himself. Unfortunately, this means killing the rich guy and assuming his identity! Now you think that this plan is really flawed--after all, how long can he pretend to be this rich guy and spend his money. BUT, this is NOT Ripley's plan--it's much more complicated and intelligent than that. Tune in to see the plan unfold. What I liked about this scenario is that HOW and WHAT Ripley did really worked well. It's NOT the half-baked plan it seems to be and was fascinating throughout. In addition, Delon, who is a fine actor, is really good in this role. Well worth seeing and one of the better films I've seen in recent weeks--and I watch A LOT of films!

    I saw this gem again last night after seeing "The talented Mr. Ripley" a few months ago, and with all my admiration for the excellent art direction in the Minguella film, Rene Clement's is far much better even with the liberties it takes with the novel's original plot. Its visual stylishness and the music score, and mostly Alain Delon's cool, cold-blooded and totally amoral character are the best things in this gorgeous-looking movie. About the 1999 version I have to say that Matt Damon's Ripley remains closer to Highsmith's conception of the character. But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book: loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in "Plein Soleil" is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time: Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s: visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come: "Charade", "Topkapi", James Bond... And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images: a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

    Alain Delon stars as Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon," an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley." There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow, which I didn't care for. Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending, which differs from her book, the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley, and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave, charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matin&eacute;e idols, really at the height of his fabulous looks here. Unlike the Minghella version, which I found preposterous, this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director, and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge (Marie Laforet) is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual. I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's. One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film, which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it, it was easier to take in this film. Like the Minghella version, Purple Noon is glorious to look at, with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.

    Purple Noon (1960) It might be hard to see "Purple Noon" with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 "The Talented Mr. Ripley." But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier "Purple Noon" is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie. But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that "which is better" comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the "talented" Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head. Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon. There are some weird flaws in "Purple Noon." One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In "Purple Noon" the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it. Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes "Purple Noon" more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. "Purple Noon" does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake. Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing "New Wave" era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

    Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.

    In films like "L'Atalante" (1934), "Der Blaue Engel" (1930) and "Fa yeung nin wa" (2000) it's imperative that the audience falls in love with the women the camera loves. In "Plein soleil" (1960) the means is quite similar: for us to become part of the film, partners in crime, we have to invest in Deloin's Ripley, and to do so we have to fall in love with him, become dependent on him, be seduced by him just like all the characters are seduced by him. The film, for me, is thus summarized in the card game on deck: the risk is known to both parties yet it's exactly the risk that makes it worth it. The film, then, plays cards at us the whole time, the knife under its thigh, and we love it for it. Deloin, of course, is beyond superb. The nerve, the distance, the excitement, all of this in his eyes, out of breath. Cl&eacute;ment's pacing is intimate, even cunning, and I love seeing Italy through his eyes. He builds suspense masterfully, and when the police visit Ripley at the hotel for the second time I gasped out loud at the moment when the cupboard door opened. These kinds of moments sneakily come and go, the whole balanced, believable enough to offer chills and make us accomplices.

    This modest French film from 1960 has dated quite badly compared to the nouvelle vague offerings that came out at the same time. The static camera work, elaborate sets and stilted, formal acting must have already seemed quite tired by the time it reached the cinema and the intervening years have not been kind. It feels, in many ways like a French attempt to do a Steve McQueen-style Hollywood film. Despite the dated style, this remains an effective character study of a sociopath. Delon's villain is amoral and lacking in any visible trace of compassion as he murders his friend and seeks to take control of his fortune only to be undone by his own arrogance and sloppiness. The transitions from playfulness to murderousness to fear are well-handled and one gains an insight into his shallow, greed-driven world. The bright colour photography unfortunately contrasts with the dark, brooding nature of the tale, further undermining the story. There is little innovation in the editing and the minor characters, such as the female love interest, are little more than ciphers. One cannot help but feel that this story, based on an American novel, has lost something in its transition between cultures. With better direction and a little more thought, this could have become a classic. Instead it feels like a strange dinosaur, caught between the old and the new.

    When I got this film, I had no idea that it was later remade as the Mr. Ripley films in the US. Now I have not yet seen any of them--but after seeing "Purple Noon" I am much more inclined to seek them out in the near future. This is because the film is so intelligently written--darn clever and quite original. Tom Ripley appears to be a mouse of a man. He's been sent to retrieve an American playboy back to the States, but with no luck. So instead, he hangs with this spoiled rich guy as he wanders through Europe having a good time. During these travels, the rich guy keeps treating Ripley like dirt--and enjoys seeing just how far he can push him. As for Ripley (Alan Delon), you are hoping that he does SOMETHING to stand up for himself. Unfortunately, this means killing the rich guy and assuming his identity! Now you think that this plan is really flawed--after all, how long can he pretend to be this rich guy and spend his money. BUT, this is NOT Ripley's plan--it's much more complicated and intelligent than that. Tune in to see the plan unfold. What I liked about this scenario is that HOW and WHAT Ripley did really worked well. It's NOT the half-baked plan it seems to be and was fascinating throughout. In addition, Delon, who is a fine actor, is really good in this role. Well worth seeing and one of the better films I've seen in recent weeks--and I watch A LOT of films!

    I saw this gem again last night after seeing "The talented Mr. Ripley" a few months ago, and with all my admiration for the excellent art direction in the Minguella film, Rene Clement's is far much better even with the liberties it takes with the novel's original plot. Its visual stylishness and the music score, and mostly Alain Delon's cool, cold-blooded and totally amoral character are the best things in this gorgeous-looking movie. About the 1999 version I have to say that Matt Damon's Ripley remains closer to Highsmith's conception of the character. But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book: loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in "Plein Soleil" is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time: Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s: visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come: "Charade", "Topkapi", James Bond... And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images: a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

    Alain Delon stars as Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon," an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley." There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow, which I didn't care for. Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending, which differs from her book, the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley, and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave, charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matin&eacute;e idols, really at the height of his fabulous looks here. Unlike the Minghella version, which I found preposterous, this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director, and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge (Marie Laforet) is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual. I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's. One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film, which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it, it was easier to take in this film. Like the Minghella version, Purple Noon is glorious to look at, with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.

    Purple Noon (1960) It might be hard to see "Purple Noon" with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 "The Talented Mr. Ripley." But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier "Purple Noon" is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie. But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that "which is better" comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the "talented" Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head. Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon. There are some weird flaws in "Purple Noon." One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In "Purple Noon" the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it. Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes "Purple Noon" more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. "Purple Noon" does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake. Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing "New Wave" era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

    I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Purple Noon, the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension. The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him. The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings: in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Cl&eacute;m&eacute;nt shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder. Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl. The character of Marge (Marie Lafor&ecirc;t) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafor&ecirc;t doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone. Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him. Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Cl&eacute;ment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca&euml;, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Cl&eacute;ment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man. I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is: a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

    Sun-swept adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel "Monsieur Ripley" involves two French playboys in Rome--one a millionaire's son, the other a ne'er-do-well who worships money and the people who have it--who come to an impasse at sea, resulting in tragedy and an elaborate cover-up. Hitchcockian drama presents a whirlpool of murder and deceit in exquisitely beautiful visual terms, with luscious color cinematography and locations. Like Alfred Hitchcock, director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in the How rather than the Why; the film doesn't run so much on emotion as it does on a rather far-fetched level of logic (though the final twist is really pressing things). The film's American counterpart, 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", played up the thriller aspects of Highsmith's story, while Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in letting the scenes unfold through careful pacing and detail. It's often extraordinary--and, by the end, extraordinarily empty. **1/2 from ****

    Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book: loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in "Plein Soleil" is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time: Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s: visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come: "Charade", "Topkapi", James Bond... And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images: a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

    Alain Delon stars as Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon," an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley." There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow, which I didn't care for. Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending, which differs from her book, the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley, and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave, charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matin&eacute;e idols, really at the height of his fabulous looks here. Unlike the Minghella version, which I found preposterous, this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director, and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge (Marie Laforet) is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual. I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's. One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film, which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it, it was easier to take in this film. Like the Minghella version, Purple Noon is glorious to look at, with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.

    Purple Noon (1960) It might be hard to see "Purple Noon" with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 "The Talented Mr. Ripley." But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier "Purple Noon" is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie. But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that "which is better" comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the "talented" Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head. Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon. There are some weird flaws in "Purple Noon." One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In "Purple Noon" the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it. Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes "Purple Noon" more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. "Purple Noon" does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake. Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing "New Wave" era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

    I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Purple Noon, the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension. The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him. The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings: in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Cl&eacute;m&eacute;nt shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder. Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl. The character of Marge (Marie Lafor&ecirc;t) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafor&ecirc;t doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone. Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him. Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Cl&eacute;ment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca&euml;, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Cl&eacute;ment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man. I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is: a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

    Sun-swept adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel "Monsieur Ripley" involves two French playboys in Rome--one a millionaire's son, the other a ne'er-do-well who worships money and the people who have it--who come to an impasse at sea, resulting in tragedy and an elaborate cover-up. Hitchcockian drama presents a whirlpool of murder and deceit in exquisitely beautiful visual terms, with luscious color cinematography and locations. Like Alfred Hitchcock, director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in the How rather than the Why; the film doesn't run so much on emotion as it does on a rather far-fetched level of logic (though the final twist is really pressing things). The film's American counterpart, 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", played up the thriller aspects of Highsmith's story, while Cl&eacute;ment is more interested in letting the scenes unfold through careful pacing and detail. It's often extraordinary--and, by the end, extraordinarily empty. **1/2 from ****

    Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler): The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

    Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.
