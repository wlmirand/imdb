    After the abysmally dour filth instalment "The Amityville Curse", the sixth outing "It's about time" was a step in the right direction. Not perfect, but at least far from boring. Like the fourth film which had a cursed lamp (yep you're reading that right), this one too sets the curse in another household in another town, but the instrument used here is an antique clock that is purchased in Amityville. It unleashes a dark supernatural force that begins to control the family, as they start turning on each other and acting out of character. Directed by Tony Randel ("Hellraiser II: Hellbound" & "Ticks"), the straight-to-video "It's about time" is a nasty little horror film concentrating more so on its vivid special effects and grisly jolts then building anything in the way of suspense. Some of the imagery is atmospherically staged, while the ghastly make-up effects (outside of the black goo) had me thinking of "Hellraiser". Even throw in a touch of incest. The performances hold up well enough. Strong turns by Stephen Macht and Shawn Weatherly with the likes of Megan Ward and Nita Talbot rounding it off. Also Dick Millar makes a cameo. The concept had creative touches, however the story mechanics are quite fundamental, but at times it can go over-the- top and be very hysterical in its silly outbursts. Too bad I find the payoff to be weak. "It's about time".

    It might be about time (Yeah? Geddit?) but were audiences really waiting with bated breath for this fifth or sixth or twentieth instalment in the seemingly neverending Amityville series? Probably not. Irritatingly, this one has a few decent ideas but never makes use of them, preferring instead to waste the slow-burning build-up on short cuts in the plot and a reliance on that most clich&eacute;d of horror movie characters, the batty neighbour who somehow knows exactly what's going on and helpfully fills in all the blanks. Almost as annoying is the film's insistence that its ending is clever, when it's clearly utter cobblers. To be fair it's probably the best sequel, but faint praise and all that.

    Amityville 1992: It's About Time (1992) ** (out of 4) Jacob Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns from a business trip in NY and has an antique clock with him. It turns out that this clock has a bad history including being present in the infamous Amityville house. Soon all sorts of bad things are going on so Jacob's son (Damon Martin) and girlfriend (Shawn Weatherly) must try and destroy the clock. This here was the sixth film in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR series and it was one (of many) that went direct-to-VHS back in the day. I think what really hurts this film's reputation is the "Amityville" title because I'm sure there are fans of the original three movies (why I don't know) who come to this cheap horror film and are disappointed that it's really not connected. Like HALLOWEEN III, if this film was released on its own and not part of a series then perhaps it would be enjoyed more. With that said, no one should mistake this for a good movie because it's not. However, it's still better than your typical low-budget film. The story itself isn't the greatest in the world but I think there are enough interesting ideas to where you can stay entertained. The film also benefits from some pretty good special effects and you're going to be shocked at how good they are compared to most movies like this. We get a rather vicious dog attack that looks quite real and the leftover impact of the attack is on full display throughout the rest of the movie as the wounds continue to ooze blood and other stuff. There are also a few other creative death scenes but one is without question really bad and I'm not going to spoil it but it's something that happens after an almost death by car. You won't miss the scene. The performances are also better than normal with Weatherly really coming across good as the girlfriend. AMITYVILLE 1992: IT'S ABOUT TIME shouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece or any sort of good cinema but it's certainly much better than most films in the series.

    Amityville 1992 is the best of the Amityville sequels by a country mile. I even enjoyed it more than the original. The story completely ignores the dreadful Amityville Curse (thankfully) and carries on the story of the evil/possessed objects being sold off from the original house. In part 4, there was an evil lamp which possessed a little girl. This time it's a clock. A family buys the clock and within days, some of the family members become possessed by the evil of Amityville. Pretty soon time starts to move forward and backwards at a rapid pace. All of this leading to a neat conclusion. There are some really cool time travel moments in this as well. Hours pass by in minutes for some characters without anyone else noticing. It's the most unique of the Amityville movies to say the least. and WOW, finally the acting is pretty good. The cast did a great job in this one. And the house the family lives in even has the windows which look like eyes, similar to the actual Amityville house. Good special effects in this too. There's a vicious dog bite and a man who melts. All pretty real looking. Amityville 1992: It's About Time is the best of the Amityville movies by a mile. The acting is great, there's realistic special effects, and an intriguing plot. This one does not disappoint. 8/10

    A dad come home and bring this clock that he got of the Amityville house for the family. (I saw this movie back to back with Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes as they are Very similar to each, bear with me if i write about scene of the 4th movie instead of this one.) What I do remember of this movie is that It's dose not take long before strange thing happen in the house, like when boy come down at night to turn the living room light off in room, when he dose there room turns red and nothing like it was before every time he turns off the light that will happen. The next day when the Dad is out jogging he then attacked by neighbour who let her dogs lose on him and then stabs the dogs that cuts dogs nose and dog runs off and later at home he dose not want to get treated but the bite is getting more painful every tick of the clock, later he goes to see neighbour and see that dog never did attack him at all, as she or never left out that day. a lot more odd thing happen in the house to many thing to mention this movie never get boring. The ending of the movie was just like it start of the movie as it was about start all over again, I was like you have got to be bloody kidding me (At this point) but I am clad it did not end that way.

    'It's About Time' rehashes a concept last seen in 'Amityville IV: The Evil Escapes', in that an artifact from the infamous Long Island house is relocated into the home of another family, where it soon begins to take over their lives with its demonic intentions. Hardly surprising, given that John G. Jones was the scribe for both installments. This, I have to say, is the better attempt, and it goes a long way towards rebuilding the damage done by the painful and indeed execrable 5th film, 'The Amityville Curse'. This time around, the artifact is a clock, and its hellish influence not only possesses both the house and its occupants (naturally), but plays around with time itself, breathing at long last some new ideas into the franchise. The tension is reasonably well-paced, allowing for a gradual build until all hell breaks loose. At the same time however, 'Amityville 1992' still suffers from a fairly silly and uneven storyline, aggravated by sloppy editing choices that prevent the overall effort from meshing together seamlessly. Add to this some rather hammy acting from veteran performers Steven Macht and Nita Talbot, along with some just plain bloody awful acting from Jonathan Penner, and it becomes difficult to take the film seriously. Thankfully the principal lead is Shawn Weatherly, who avoids the obvious temptation the script offers to go over-the-top and gives a creditable performance under the circumstances, as does Damon Martin, in what looks to be his final film. Nonetheless, 'It's About Time' makes a far better effort to remember its roots than its two predecessors. With minimal rewrites, IV and V could very easily just be standalone horror flicks, but the plot of VI rests upon the apparently again-destroyed Amityville house's past history. On the one hand, it has no conscious ties to the DeFeo murders, but in the universe of the film franchise, these were supposed to be influenced by the house's long-present demonic incumbents, and it is here where 'It's About Time' builds its story. In the process, it grafts yet another unnecessary centuries-old European explanation for its dark history which I didn't really buy into, but I can let it slide since new ground is being explored. After all, I also have to put aside the obvious fact that if this clock has been in the house all along, why does it only manifest its powers now? Yet this is the most interesting aspect of the film, and if anything, Jones should have really let fly with the time distortion element and tried harder to pull it together into what could have been an even better and possibly mind-bending tale. At any rate, 'It's About Time' pulls the franchise out of the mire that the previous installment dumped it into. It's still fairly silly, but a great improvement nonetheless.

    ***SPOILERS*** The fifth installment of the Amityville Horror that really has nothing to do with the famed haunted house. It has to do with an antique French clock that supposedly was found, before the cursed dwelling was finally demolished, in it. Getting the clock for a steal widowed architect Jacob Sterling, Stephen Macht, brings it back to his home to Southern California as memento of his trip back east. The clock as it soon turned out is in league with the Devil in being able to drive people to do evil and ungodly things. It also can drive those who are in possession of it insane as it soon does to the unsuspecting Jacob. Jacob ends up being brutally mauled by his neighbor's sweet and lovable dog peaches ending up with both rabies and a gangrenous right leg. Mad and deranged Jacob, not seeking medical help, goes completely insane locking himself up in his room and playing with toy houses as his two kids Lisa & Rusty,Megan Ward & Damon Martin, and live in housemaid and lover Andrea, Shawn Weatherly, flee in panic. It soon becomes evident to Rusty that it's that damn clock that driving everybody in the Sterling home crazy which now includes, besides his already cracked-up dad Jacob, his sexy hot to trot sister Lisa. Things get so out of control that Andera calls for help in having her former boyfriend psychiatrist Dr. Lenoard Stafford, Jonathan Penner, come over and get the now criminally deranged Jacob committed to the nearest mental institution before he cause any more damage! This all backfires with Jonathan not the crazed and out of control Jacob left hanging, or better yet twisting, in the wind. ***SPOILERS*** The movie ends much like it began but with the knowledge, to those watching, that it was that clock that was responsible for all the mental and psychical carnage that happened in the movie. It was there and then that Andrea did what she should have done right from the start which would have prevented all the mass hysteria, and insanity, from occurring! And thus saved the world, or those in the movie, a whole lot of pain and suffering.

    After the special effects heavy '3-D,' the hokiness of 'The Evil Escapes,' and the barely related 'The Amityville Curse,' the haunted house series that started in 1979 either needed a permanent rest or a shot of life in the arm. In 1992 Republic Pictures released the sixth installment straight to video and after the blandness that was the previous installment I don't imagine it was met with much enthusiasm. And lets be honest, the world really didn't need another 'Amityville' sequel did it? But to the surprise of some viewers this sequel was actually not too bad. In fact it's actually rather good; more than it has any right to be. Pros: Has some of the best writing in the series. Strong performances from everyone involved. A really nice score from Daniel Licht, who kind of made a career out scoring direct-to-video sequels in the 90s. Moves at a fine pace. Some creative and graphic death scenes. Excellent work on the special and make-up effects. A couple really intense and scary sequences. Predictable is not a word I would use when describing this film. Cool twist ending. Cons: Though not a bad directing job it's nothing spectacular, especially compared to Tony Randel's work on 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II.' The finale is exciting, but also maybe a bit too over-the-top. Lacks the feeling of dread and sharp scares of the first two. Final thoughts: I'd always enjoyed the first four films in this series, but never thought that highly of them. I also never expected this sequel to be as good as it is. Nowadays the majority of sequels that go straight to the video store shelf aren't watchable and a complete waste of time and money, but 'Amityville 1992' is one of those rare examples of one done right. My rating: 4/5

    "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" is a lot better than expected for one of these entries. **SPOILERS** Returning home from work, Jacob Sterling, (Stephen Macht) shows his girlfriend Andrea Livingstone, (Shawn Weatherly) and his family, Lisa, (Megan Ward) and Rusty, (Damon Martin) a new clock that he picked up from his work. As they continue on with their lives, they start to notice that there's something wrong with the house, and when he is attacked by a local dog, he is bed-ridden and forces her to bring her friend Dr. Leonard Stafford, (Jonathan Penner) to come out to help her. As the weird events surrounding the family continue, and soon start to branch out to others in the community, they realize that the incidents are caused by the clock, which was brought along from a house in Amityville, New York that once belonged to a deranged teacher who's soul had possessed everything in the house. Realizing the danger, they try to leave the house before they all succumb to the house's evil powers. The Good News: This one here is a lot better than expected. One of the good things about it is the film has a couple really great cheesy scenes that work wonderfully. The trick with the light-switch in the living room at the beginning is pretty cool, mainly due to what the room switches over into, a call-out to the original with goo that appears in people's bed one minute and not the next, a really tense moment where a game of sibling roughhousing turns violent and much more. There's also a fantastic sequence where, as one character waits for a microwave to finish, it stops and another character appears suddenly in front of them, going off on a rant about the effectiveness of a particular firearm before turning it on them to question whether or not anything sexual happened between a former couple, then is revealed to all have been a subconscious hallucination. It's big one, though, is when the changed daughter lures the boyfriend down into the basement to sleep with him, only to have the tables turned in a sequence so glorious that the end result has to be seen. It also decides to give way to the sleaze when desired, with the simply superb sequence where, dressed in a night-gown, she proceeds to check herself out in a full-length mirror, and after a couple seconds, the mirror-image begins doing other activities, and soon after pleasuring herself, reaches out of the mirror and repeats it on her in person. It's sleazy and certainly leaves a wonderful impression on it. There's even a pretty nifty, sweat-filled sex-scene that keeps the sleaze moniker intact through most of the film. Aside from the cheese, it has some good stuff in it, most notably the realistic and brutal dog-mauling. This one is incredibly realistic, due to the dog continually going after the same wound time and time again, the absolute refusal to let go and bring the target back closer to it when it tries to escape and ends with it showing a lot of brutality. It's a really great, fantastic scene that really has a lot going it. The last big part in the film that works is the cheesy deaths, which are pretty bloody. There's a fire-poker through the leg, a radio's power cord shoved into the mouth and electrocutes, leaving a dark, festering wound around the point of insertion, impaled in the chest and a rope-hanging, among others to get some nice blood and gore in here. All these here make the film more than enjoyable. The Bad News: This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws, but they are there. The fact that this one is still a really big cheese-fest is one of the main concerns with this one. It's not completely serious, at least in tone, despite what is offered as being definitely cheesy in appearance, or at least in execution. The conclusion to the basement sequence is quite a perfect example, and is one of the main reasons as to why this one will score lower than most of the other flaws. The ending is another small factor, using a time-honored trick to end it that can be seen coming from a mile away and doesn't have any differences away from the usual. The slow, more methodical pace is something that could've been fixed, mainly since it would've shortened it a bit since there's no reason why this goes on for as long as it does, but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws. The Final Verdict: A lot better than expected, this one here has a lot more going on for it than the others and is one of the better entries. Give this one a shot if the series is entertaining or if there's something in it that appeals to you, otherwise then stick away from this one as there's a lot better ones out there. Rated R: Violence, Language, animal violence, Nudity and a mild sex scene

    A widowed father Jake Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns home from a business meeting in Amityville. He brings home a gift for his two teenage kids: an eerie looking old mantle clock. What he doesn't know, is the clock has an evil past being created by a 15th century French necromancer (eater of the dead). The clock is tied to the evil past of Amityville. Soon after placing it on the fireplace mantle, he is attacked by the local neighborhood dog, leaving his ex-girlfriend Andrea (Shawn Weatherly) to take care of him. As Jake's son and a neighbor get closer to finding out the legend of the clock, all hell breaks loose as hedges are set on fire, the dog is murdered, time begins to skip hours and slow down, Jake's daughter becomes seductive, and many people around them begin to die. Now, no one is safe from the terror as the clock begins to become the house itself. I really it's time they put the Amityville series to rest. Awful scripting, bad direction and even the stupid scream scenes can't save this one. The abrupt ending doesn't help either. Unrated for Violence.

    'It's About Time' rehashes a concept last seen in 'Amityville IV: The Evil Escapes', in that an artifact from the infamous Long Island house is relocated into the home of another family, where it soon begins to take over their lives with its demonic intentions. Hardly surprising, given that John G. Jones was the scribe for both installments. This, I have to say, is the better attempt, and it goes a long way towards rebuilding the damage done by the painful and indeed execrable 5th film, 'The Amityville Curse'. This time around, the artifact is a clock, and its hellish influence not only possesses both the house and its occupants (naturally), but plays around with time itself, breathing at long last some new ideas into the franchise. The tension is reasonably well-paced, allowing for a gradual build until all hell breaks loose. At the same time however, 'Amityville 1992' still suffers from a fairly silly and uneven storyline, aggravated by sloppy editing choices that prevent the overall effort from meshing together seamlessly. Add to this some rather hammy acting from veteran performers Steven Macht and Nita Talbot, along with some just plain bloody awful acting from Jonathan Penner, and it becomes difficult to take the film seriously. Thankfully the principal lead is Shawn Weatherly, who avoids the obvious temptation the script offers to go over-the-top and gives a creditable performance under the circumstances, as does Damon Martin, in what looks to be his final film. Nonetheless, 'It's About Time' makes a far better effort to remember its roots than its two predecessors. With minimal rewrites, IV and V could very easily just be standalone horror flicks, but the plot of VI rests upon the apparently again-destroyed Amityville house's past history. On the one hand, it has no conscious ties to the DeFeo murders, but in the universe of the film franchise, these were supposed to be influenced by the house's long-present demonic incumbents, and it is here where 'It's About Time' builds its story. In the process, it grafts yet another unnecessary centuries-old European explanation for its dark history which I didn't really buy into, but I can let it slide since new ground is being explored. After all, I also have to put aside the obvious fact that if this clock has been in the house all along, why does it only manifest its powers now? Yet this is the most interesting aspect of the film, and if anything, Jones should have really let fly with the time distortion element and tried harder to pull it together into what could have been an even better and possibly mind-bending tale. At any rate, 'It's About Time' pulls the franchise out of the mire that the previous installment dumped it into. It's still fairly silly, but a great improvement nonetheless.

    ***SPOILERS*** The fifth installment of the Amityville Horror that really has nothing to do with the famed haunted house. It has to do with an antique French clock that supposedly was found, before the cursed dwelling was finally demolished, in it. Getting the clock for a steal widowed architect Jacob Sterling, Stephen Macht, brings it back to his home to Southern California as memento of his trip back east. The clock as it soon turned out is in league with the Devil in being able to drive people to do evil and ungodly things. It also can drive those who are in possession of it insane as it soon does to the unsuspecting Jacob. Jacob ends up being brutally mauled by his neighbor's sweet and lovable dog peaches ending up with both rabies and a gangrenous right leg. Mad and deranged Jacob, not seeking medical help, goes completely insane locking himself up in his room and playing with toy houses as his two kids Lisa & Rusty,Megan Ward & Damon Martin, and live in housemaid and lover Andrea, Shawn Weatherly, flee in panic. It soon becomes evident to Rusty that it's that damn clock that driving everybody in the Sterling home crazy which now includes, besides his already cracked-up dad Jacob, his sexy hot to trot sister Lisa. Things get so out of control that Andera calls for help in having her former boyfriend psychiatrist Dr. Lenoard Stafford, Jonathan Penner, come over and get the now criminally deranged Jacob committed to the nearest mental institution before he cause any more damage! This all backfires with Jonathan not the crazed and out of control Jacob left hanging, or better yet twisting, in the wind. ***SPOILERS*** The movie ends much like it began but with the knowledge, to those watching, that it was that clock that was responsible for all the mental and psychical carnage that happened in the movie. It was there and then that Andrea did what she should have done right from the start which would have prevented all the mass hysteria, and insanity, from occurring! And thus saved the world, or those in the movie, a whole lot of pain and suffering.

    After the special effects heavy '3-D,' the hokiness of 'The Evil Escapes,' and the barely related 'The Amityville Curse,' the haunted house series that started in 1979 either needed a permanent rest or a shot of life in the arm. In 1992 Republic Pictures released the sixth installment straight to video and after the blandness that was the previous installment I don't imagine it was met with much enthusiasm. And lets be honest, the world really didn't need another 'Amityville' sequel did it? But to the surprise of some viewers this sequel was actually not too bad. In fact it's actually rather good; more than it has any right to be. Pros: Has some of the best writing in the series. Strong performances from everyone involved. A really nice score from Daniel Licht, who kind of made a career out scoring direct-to-video sequels in the 90s. Moves at a fine pace. Some creative and graphic death scenes. Excellent work on the special and make-up effects. A couple really intense and scary sequences. Predictable is not a word I would use when describing this film. Cool twist ending. Cons: Though not a bad directing job it's nothing spectacular, especially compared to Tony Randel's work on 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II.' The finale is exciting, but also maybe a bit too over-the-top. Lacks the feeling of dread and sharp scares of the first two. Final thoughts: I'd always enjoyed the first four films in this series, but never thought that highly of them. I also never expected this sequel to be as good as it is. Nowadays the majority of sequels that go straight to the video store shelf aren't watchable and a complete waste of time and money, but 'Amityville 1992' is one of those rare examples of one done right. My rating: 4/5

    "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" is a lot better than expected for one of these entries. **SPOILERS** Returning home from work, Jacob Sterling, (Stephen Macht) shows his girlfriend Andrea Livingstone, (Shawn Weatherly) and his family, Lisa, (Megan Ward) and Rusty, (Damon Martin) a new clock that he picked up from his work. As they continue on with their lives, they start to notice that there's something wrong with the house, and when he is attacked by a local dog, he is bed-ridden and forces her to bring her friend Dr. Leonard Stafford, (Jonathan Penner) to come out to help her. As the weird events surrounding the family continue, and soon start to branch out to others in the community, they realize that the incidents are caused by the clock, which was brought along from a house in Amityville, New York that once belonged to a deranged teacher who's soul had possessed everything in the house. Realizing the danger, they try to leave the house before they all succumb to the house's evil powers. The Good News: This one here is a lot better than expected. One of the good things about it is the film has a couple really great cheesy scenes that work wonderfully. The trick with the light-switch in the living room at the beginning is pretty cool, mainly due to what the room switches over into, a call-out to the original with goo that appears in people's bed one minute and not the next, a really tense moment where a game of sibling roughhousing turns violent and much more. There's also a fantastic sequence where, as one character waits for a microwave to finish, it stops and another character appears suddenly in front of them, going off on a rant about the effectiveness of a particular firearm before turning it on them to question whether or not anything sexual happened between a former couple, then is revealed to all have been a subconscious hallucination. It's big one, though, is when the changed daughter lures the boyfriend down into the basement to sleep with him, only to have the tables turned in a sequence so glorious that the end result has to be seen. It also decides to give way to the sleaze when desired, with the simply superb sequence where, dressed in a night-gown, she proceeds to check herself out in a full-length mirror, and after a couple seconds, the mirror-image begins doing other activities, and soon after pleasuring herself, reaches out of the mirror and repeats it on her in person. It's sleazy and certainly leaves a wonderful impression on it. There's even a pretty nifty, sweat-filled sex-scene that keeps the sleaze moniker intact through most of the film. Aside from the cheese, it has some good stuff in it, most notably the realistic and brutal dog-mauling. This one is incredibly realistic, due to the dog continually going after the same wound time and time again, the absolute refusal to let go and bring the target back closer to it when it tries to escape and ends with it showing a lot of brutality. It's a really great, fantastic scene that really has a lot going it. The last big part in the film that works is the cheesy deaths, which are pretty bloody. There's a fire-poker through the leg, a radio's power cord shoved into the mouth and electrocutes, leaving a dark, festering wound around the point of insertion, impaled in the chest and a rope-hanging, among others to get some nice blood and gore in here. All these here make the film more than enjoyable. The Bad News: This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws, but they are there. The fact that this one is still a really big cheese-fest is one of the main concerns with this one. It's not completely serious, at least in tone, despite what is offered as being definitely cheesy in appearance, or at least in execution. The conclusion to the basement sequence is quite a perfect example, and is one of the main reasons as to why this one will score lower than most of the other flaws. The ending is another small factor, using a time-honored trick to end it that can be seen coming from a mile away and doesn't have any differences away from the usual. The slow, more methodical pace is something that could've been fixed, mainly since it would've shortened it a bit since there's no reason why this goes on for as long as it does, but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws. The Final Verdict: A lot better than expected, this one here has a lot more going on for it than the others and is one of the better entries. Give this one a shot if the series is entertaining or if there's something in it that appeals to you, otherwise then stick away from this one as there's a lot better ones out there. Rated R: Violence, Language, animal violence, Nudity and a mild sex scene

    A widowed father Jake Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns home from a business meeting in Amityville. He brings home a gift for his two teenage kids: an eerie looking old mantle clock. What he doesn't know, is the clock has an evil past being created by a 15th century French necromancer (eater of the dead). The clock is tied to the evil past of Amityville. Soon after placing it on the fireplace mantle, he is attacked by the local neighborhood dog, leaving his ex-girlfriend Andrea (Shawn Weatherly) to take care of him. As Jake's son and a neighbor get closer to finding out the legend of the clock, all hell breaks loose as hedges are set on fire, the dog is murdered, time begins to skip hours and slow down, Jake's daughter becomes seductive, and many people around them begin to die. Now, no one is safe from the terror as the clock begins to become the house itself. I really it's time they put the Amityville series to rest. Awful scripting, bad direction and even the stupid scream scenes can't save this one. The abrupt ending doesn't help either. Unrated for Violence.

    After the abysmally dour filth instalment "The Amityville Curse", the sixth outing "It's about time" was a step in the right direction. Not perfect, but at least far from boring. Like the fourth film which had a cursed lamp (yep you're reading that right), this one too sets the curse in another household in another town, but the instrument used here is an antique clock that is purchased in Amityville. It unleashes a dark supernatural force that begins to control the family, as they start turning on each other and acting out of character. Directed by Tony Randel ("Hellraiser II: Hellbound" & "Ticks"), the straight-to-video "It's about time" is a nasty little horror film concentrating more so on its vivid special effects and grisly jolts then building anything in the way of suspense. Some of the imagery is atmospherically staged, while the ghastly make-up effects (outside of the black goo) had me thinking of "Hellraiser". Even throw in a touch of incest. The performances hold up well enough. Strong turns by Stephen Macht and Shawn Weatherly with the likes of Megan Ward and Nita Talbot rounding it off. Also Dick Millar makes a cameo. The concept had creative touches, however the story mechanics are quite fundamental, but at times it can go over-the- top and be very hysterical in its silly outbursts. Too bad I find the payoff to be weak. "It's about time".

    It might be about time (Yeah? Geddit?) but were audiences really waiting with bated breath for this fifth or sixth or twentieth instalment in the seemingly neverending Amityville series? Probably not. Irritatingly, this one has a few decent ideas but never makes use of them, preferring instead to waste the slow-burning build-up on short cuts in the plot and a reliance on that most clich&eacute;d of horror movie characters, the batty neighbour who somehow knows exactly what's going on and helpfully fills in all the blanks. Almost as annoying is the film's insistence that its ending is clever, when it's clearly utter cobblers. To be fair it's probably the best sequel, but faint praise and all that.

    Amityville 1992: It's About Time (1992) ** (out of 4) Jacob Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns from a business trip in NY and has an antique clock with him. It turns out that this clock has a bad history including being present in the infamous Amityville house. Soon all sorts of bad things are going on so Jacob's son (Damon Martin) and girlfriend (Shawn Weatherly) must try and destroy the clock. This here was the sixth film in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR series and it was one (of many) that went direct-to-VHS back in the day. I think what really hurts this film's reputation is the "Amityville" title because I'm sure there are fans of the original three movies (why I don't know) who come to this cheap horror film and are disappointed that it's really not connected. Like HALLOWEEN III, if this film was released on its own and not part of a series then perhaps it would be enjoyed more. With that said, no one should mistake this for a good movie because it's not. However, it's still better than your typical low-budget film. The story itself isn't the greatest in the world but I think there are enough interesting ideas to where you can stay entertained. The film also benefits from some pretty good special effects and you're going to be shocked at how good they are compared to most movies like this. We get a rather vicious dog attack that looks quite real and the leftover impact of the attack is on full display throughout the rest of the movie as the wounds continue to ooze blood and other stuff. There are also a few other creative death scenes but one is without question really bad and I'm not going to spoil it but it's something that happens after an almost death by car. You won't miss the scene. The performances are also better than normal with Weatherly really coming across good as the girlfriend. AMITYVILLE 1992: IT'S ABOUT TIME shouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece or any sort of good cinema but it's certainly much better than most films in the series.

    Amityville 1992 is the best of the Amityville sequels by a country mile. I even enjoyed it more than the original. The story completely ignores the dreadful Amityville Curse (thankfully) and carries on the story of the evil/possessed objects being sold off from the original house. In part 4, there was an evil lamp which possessed a little girl. This time it's a clock. A family buys the clock and within days, some of the family members become possessed by the evil of Amityville. Pretty soon time starts to move forward and backwards at a rapid pace. All of this leading to a neat conclusion. There are some really cool time travel moments in this as well. Hours pass by in minutes for some characters without anyone else noticing. It's the most unique of the Amityville movies to say the least. and WOW, finally the acting is pretty good. The cast did a great job in this one. And the house the family lives in even has the windows which look like eyes, similar to the actual Amityville house. Good special effects in this too. There's a vicious dog bite and a man who melts. All pretty real looking. Amityville 1992: It's About Time is the best of the Amityville movies by a mile. The acting is great, there's realistic special effects, and an intriguing plot. This one does not disappoint. 8/10

    A dad come home and bring this clock that he got of the Amityville house for the family. (I saw this movie back to back with Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes as they are Very similar to each, bear with me if i write about scene of the 4th movie instead of this one.) What I do remember of this movie is that It's dose not take long before strange thing happen in the house, like when boy come down at night to turn the living room light off in room, when he dose there room turns red and nothing like it was before every time he turns off the light that will happen. The next day when the Dad is out jogging he then attacked by neighbour who let her dogs lose on him and then stabs the dogs that cuts dogs nose and dog runs off and later at home he dose not want to get treated but the bite is getting more painful every tick of the clock, later he goes to see neighbour and see that dog never did attack him at all, as she or never left out that day. a lot more odd thing happen in the house to many thing to mention this movie never get boring. The ending of the movie was just like it start of the movie as it was about start all over again, I was like you have got to be bloody kidding me (At this point) but I am clad it did not end that way.

The conclusion to the basement sequence is quite a perfect example, and is one of the main reasons as to why this one will score lower than most of the other flaws. The ending is another small factor, using a time-honored trick to end it that can be seen coming from a mile away and doesn't have any differences away from the usual. The slow, more methodical pace is something that could've been fixed, mainly since it would've shortened it a bit since there's no reason why this goes on for as long as it does, but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws. The Final Verdict: A lot better than expected, this one here has a lot more going on for it than the others and is one of the better entries. Give this one a shot if the series is entertaining or if there's something in it that appeals to you, otherwise then stick away from this one as there's a lot better ones out there. Rated R: Violence, Language, animal violence, Nudity and a mild sex scene

    A widowed father Jake Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns home from a business meeting in Amityville. He brings home a gift for his two teenage kids: an eerie looking old mantle clock. What he doesn't know, is the clock has an evil past being created by a 15th century French necromancer (eater of the dead). The clock is tied to the evil past of Amityville. Soon after placing it on the fireplace mantle, he is attacked by the local neighborhood dog, leaving his ex-girlfriend Andrea (Shawn Weatherly) to take care of him. As Jake's son and a neighbor get closer to finding out the legend of the clock, all hell breaks loose as hedges are set on fire, the dog is murdered, time begins to skip hours and slow down, Jake's daughter becomes seductive, and many people around them begin to die. Now, no one is safe from the terror as the clock begins to become the house itself. I really it's time they put the Amityville series to rest. Awful scripting, bad direction and even the stupid scream scenes can't save this one. The abrupt ending doesn't help either. Unrated for Violence.

    After the abysmally dour filth instalment "The Amityville Curse", the sixth outing "It's about time" was a step in the right direction. Not perfect, but at least far from boring. Like the fourth film which had a cursed lamp (yep you're reading that right), this one too sets the curse in another household in another town, but the instrument used here is an antique clock that is purchased in Amityville. It unleashes a dark supernatural force that begins to control the family, as they start turning on each other and acting out of character. Directed by Tony Randel ("Hellraiser II: Hellbound" & "Ticks"), the straight-to-video "It's about time" is a nasty little horror film concentrating more so on its vivid special effects and grisly jolts then building anything in the way of suspense. Some of the imagery is atmospherically staged, while the ghastly make-up effects (outside of the black goo) had me thinking of "Hellraiser". Even throw in a touch of incest. The performances hold up well enough. Strong turns by Stephen Macht and Shawn Weatherly with the likes of Megan Ward and Nita Talbot rounding it off. Also Dick Millar makes a cameo. The concept had creative touches, however the story mechanics are quite fundamental, but at times it can go over-the- top and be very hysterical in its silly outbursts. Too bad I find the payoff to be weak. "It's about time".

    It might be about time (Yeah? Geddit?) but were audiences really waiting with bated breath for this fifth or sixth or twentieth instalment in the seemingly neverending Amityville series? Probably not. Irritatingly, this one has a few decent ideas but never makes use of them, preferring instead to waste the slow-burning build-up on short cuts in the plot and a reliance on that most clich&eacute;d of horror movie characters, the batty neighbour who somehow knows exactly what's going on and helpfully fills in all the blanks. Almost as annoying is the film's insistence that its ending is clever, when it's clearly utter cobblers. To be fair it's probably the best sequel, but faint praise and all that.

    Amityville 1992: It's About Time (1992) ** (out of 4) Jacob Sterling (Stephen Macht) returns from a business trip in NY and has an antique clock with him. It turns out that this clock has a bad history including being present in the infamous Amityville house. Soon all sorts of bad things are going on so Jacob's son (Damon Martin) and girlfriend (Shawn Weatherly) must try and destroy the clock. This here was the sixth film in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR series and it was one (of many) that went direct-to-VHS back in the day. I think what really hurts this film's reputation is the "Amityville" title because I'm sure there are fans of the original three movies (why I don't know) who come to this cheap horror film and are disappointed that it's really not connected. Like HALLOWEEN III, if this film was released on its own and not part of a series then perhaps it would be enjoyed more. With that said, no one should mistake this for a good movie because it's not. However, it's still better than your typical low-budget film. The story itself isn't the greatest in the world but I think there are enough interesting ideas to where you can stay entertained. The film also benefits from some pretty good special effects and you're going to be shocked at how good they are compared to most movies like this. We get a rather vicious dog attack that looks quite real and the leftover impact of the attack is on full display throughout the rest of the movie as the wounds continue to ooze blood and other stuff. There are also a few other creative death scenes but one is without question really bad and I'm not going to spoil it but it's something that happens after an almost death by car. You won't miss the scene. The performances are also better than normal with Weatherly really coming across good as the girlfriend. AMITYVILLE 1992: IT'S ABOUT TIME shouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece or any sort of good cinema but it's certainly much better than most films in the series.

    Amityville 1992 is the best of the Amityville sequels by a country mile. I even enjoyed it more than the original. The story completely ignores the dreadful Amityville Curse (thankfully) and carries on the story of the evil/possessed objects being sold off from the original house. In part 4, there was an evil lamp which possessed a little girl. This time it's a clock. A family buys the clock and within days, some of the family members become possessed by the evil of Amityville. Pretty soon time starts to move forward and backwards at a rapid pace. All of this leading to a neat conclusion. There are some really cool time travel moments in this as well. Hours pass by in minutes for some characters without anyone else noticing. It's the most unique of the Amityville movies to say the least. and WOW, finally the acting is pretty good. The cast did a great job in this one. And the house the family lives in even has the windows which look like eyes, similar to the actual Amityville house. Good special effects in this too. There's a vicious dog bite and a man who melts. All pretty real looking. Amityville 1992: It's About Time is the best of the Amityville movies by a mile. The acting is great, there's realistic special effects, and an intriguing plot. This one does not disappoint. 8/10

    A dad come home and bring this clock that he got of the Amityville house for the family. (I saw this movie back to back with Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes as they are Very similar to each, bear with me if i write about scene of the 4th movie instead of this one.) What I do remember of this movie is that It's dose not take long before strange thing happen in the house, like when boy come down at night to turn the living room light off in room, when he dose there room turns red and nothing like it was before every time he turns off the light that will happen. The next day when the Dad is out jogging he then attacked by neighbour who let her dogs lose on him and then stabs the dogs that cuts dogs nose and dog runs off and later at home he dose not want to get treated but the bite is getting more painful every tick of the clock, later he goes to see neighbour and see that dog never did attack him at all, as she or never left out that day. a lot more odd thing happen in the house to many thing to mention this movie never get boring. The ending of the movie was just like it start of the movie as it was about start all over again, I was like you have got to be bloody kidding me (At this point) but I am clad it did not end that way.

    'It's About Time' rehashes a concept last seen in 'Amityville IV: The Evil Escapes', in that an artifact from the infamous Long Island house is relocated into the home of another family, where it soon begins to take over their lives with its demonic intentions. Hardly surprising, given that John G. Jones was the scribe for both installments. This, I have to say, is the better attempt, and it goes a long way towards rebuilding the damage done by the painful and indeed execrable 5th film, 'The Amityville Curse'. This time around, the artifact is a clock, and its hellish influence not only possesses both the house and its occupants (naturally), but plays around with time itself, breathing at long last some new ideas into the franchise. The tension is reasonably well-paced, allowing for a gradual build until all hell breaks loose. At the same time however, 'Amityville 1992' still suffers from a fairly silly and uneven storyline, aggravated by sloppy editing choices that prevent the overall effort from meshing together seamlessly. Add to this some rather hammy acting from veteran performers Steven Macht and Nita Talbot, along with some just plain bloody awful acting from Jonathan Penner, and it becomes difficult to take the film seriously. Thankfully the principal lead is Shawn Weatherly, who avoids the obvious temptation the script offers to go over-the-top and gives a creditable performance under the circumstances, as does Damon Martin, in what looks to be his final film. Nonetheless, 'It's About Time' makes a far better effort to remember its roots than its two predecessors. With minimal rewrites, IV and V could very easily just be standalone horror flicks, but the plot of VI rests upon the apparently again-destroyed Amityville house's past history. On the one hand, it has no conscious ties to the DeFeo murders, but in the universe of the film franchise, these were supposed to be influenced by the house's long-present demonic incumbents, and it is here where 'It's About Time' builds its story. In the process, it grafts yet another unnecessary centuries-old European explanation for its dark history which I didn't really buy into, but I can let it slide since new ground is being explored. After all, I also have to put aside the obvious fact that if this clock has been in the house all along, why does it only manifest its powers now? Yet this is the most interesting aspect of the film, and if anything, Jones should have really let fly with the time distortion element and tried harder to pull it together into what could have been an even better and possibly mind-bending tale. At any rate, 'It's About Time' pulls the franchise out of the mire that the previous installment dumped it into. It's still fairly silly, but a great improvement nonetheless.

    ***SPOILERS*** The fifth installment of the Amityville Horror that really has nothing to do with the famed haunted house. It has to do with an antique French clock that supposedly was found, before the cursed dwelling was finally demolished, in it. Getting the clock for a steal widowed architect Jacob Sterling, Stephen Macht, brings it back to his home to Southern California as memento of his trip back east. The clock as it soon turned out is in league with the Devil in being able to drive people to do evil and ungodly things. It also can drive those who are in possession of it insane as it soon does to the unsuspecting Jacob. Jacob ends up being brutally mauled by his neighbor's sweet and lovable dog peaches ending up with both rabies and a gangrenous right leg. Mad and deranged Jacob, not seeking medical help, goes completely insane locking himself up in his room and playing with toy houses as his two kids Lisa & Rusty,Megan Ward & Damon Martin, and live in housemaid and lover Andrea, Shawn Weatherly, flee in panic. It soon becomes evident to Rusty that it's that damn clock that driving everybody in the Sterling home crazy which now includes, besides his already cracked-up dad Jacob, his sexy hot to trot sister Lisa. Things get so out of control that Andera calls for help in having her former boyfriend psychiatrist Dr. Lenoard Stafford, Jonathan Penner, come over and get the now criminally deranged Jacob committed to the nearest mental institution before he cause any more damage! This all backfires with Jonathan not the crazed and out of control Jacob left hanging, or better yet twisting, in the wind. ***SPOILERS*** The movie ends much like it began but with the knowledge, to those watching, that it was that clock that was responsible for all the mental and psychical carnage that happened in the movie. It was there and then that Andrea did what she should have done right from the start which would have prevented all the mass hysteria, and insanity, from occurring! And thus saved the world, or those in the movie, a whole lot of pain and suffering.

    After the special effects heavy '3-D,' the hokiness of 'The Evil Escapes,' and the barely related 'The Amityville Curse,' the haunted house series that started in 1979 either needed a permanent rest or a shot of life in the arm. In 1992 Republic Pictures released the sixth installment straight to video and after the blandness that was the previous installment I don't imagine it was met with much enthusiasm. And lets be honest, the world really didn't need another 'Amityville' sequel did it? But to the surprise of some viewers this sequel was actually not too bad. In fact it's actually rather good; more than it has any right to be. Pros: Has some of the best writing in the series. Strong performances from everyone involved. A really nice score from Daniel Licht, who kind of made a career out scoring direct-to-video sequels in the 90s. Moves at a fine pace. Some creative and graphic death scenes. Excellent work on the special and make-up effects. A couple really intense and scary sequences. Predictable is not a word I would use when describing this film. Cool twist ending. Cons: Though not a bad directing job it's nothing spectacular, especially compared to Tony Randel's work on 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II.' The finale is exciting, but also maybe a bit too over-the-top. Lacks the feeling of dread and sharp scares of the first two. Final thoughts: I'd always enjoyed the first four films in this series, but never thought that highly of them. I also never expected this sequel to be as good as it is. Nowadays the majority of sequels that go straight to the video store shelf aren't watchable and a complete waste of time and money, but 'Amityville 1992' is one of those rare examples of one done right. My rating: 4/5

    "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" is a lot better than expected for one of these entries. **SPOILERS** Returning home from work, Jacob Sterling, (Stephen Macht) shows his girlfriend Andrea Livingstone, (Shawn Weatherly) and his family, Lisa, (Megan Ward) and Rusty, (Damon Martin) a new clock that he picked up from his work. As they continue on with their lives, they start to notice that there's something wrong with the house, and when he is attacked by a local dog, he is bed-ridden and forces her to bring her friend Dr. Leonard Stafford, (Jonathan Penner) to come out to help her. As the weird events surrounding the family continue, and soon start to branch out to others in the community, they realize that the incidents are caused by the clock, which was brought along from a house in Amityville, New York that once belonged to a deranged teacher who's soul had possessed everything in the house. Realizing the danger, they try to leave the house before they all succumb to the house's evil powers. The Good News: This one here is a lot better than expected. One of the good things about it is the film has a couple really great cheesy scenes that work wonderfully. The trick with the light-switch in the living room at the beginning is pretty cool, mainly due to what the room switches over into, a call-out to the original with goo that appears in people's bed one minute and not the next, a really tense moment where a game of sibling roughhousing turns violent and much more. There's also a fantastic sequence where, as one character waits for a microwave to finish, it stops and another character appears suddenly in front of them, going off on a rant about the effectiveness of a particular firearm before turning it on them to question whether or not anything sexual happened between a former couple, then is revealed to all have been a subconscious hallucination. It's big one, though, is when the changed daughter lures the boyfriend down into the basement to sleep with him, only to have the tables turned in a sequence so glorious that the end result has to be seen. It also decides to give way to the sleaze when desired, with the simply superb sequence where, dressed in a night-gown, she proceeds to check herself out in a full-length mirror, and after a couple seconds, the mirror-image begins doing other activities, and soon after pleasuring herself, reaches out of the mirror and repeats it on her in person. It's sleazy and certainly leaves a wonderful impression on it. There's even a pretty nifty, sweat-filled sex-scene that keeps the sleaze moniker intact through most of the film. Aside from the cheese, it has some good stuff in it, most notably the realistic and brutal dog-mauling. This one is incredibly realistic, due to the dog continually going after the same wound time and time again, the absolute refusal to let go and bring the target back closer to it when it tries to escape and ends with it showing a lot of brutality. It's a really great, fantastic scene that really has a lot going it. The last big part in the film that works is the cheesy deaths, which are pretty bloody. There's a fire-poker through the leg, a radio's power cord shoved into the mouth and electrocutes, leaving a dark, festering wound around the point of insertion, impaled in the chest and a rope-hanging, among others to get some nice blood and gore in here. All these here make the film more than enjoyable. The Bad News: This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws, but they are there. The fact that this one is still a really big cheese-fest is one of the main concerns with this one. It's not completely serious, at least in tone, despite what is offered as being definitely cheesy in appearance, or at least in execution. The conclusion to the basement sequence is quite a perfect example, and is one of the main reasons as to why this one will score lower than most of the other flaws. The ending is another small factor, using a time-honored trick to end it that can be seen coming from a mile away and doesn't have any differences away from the usual. The slow, more methodical pace is something that could've been fixed, mainly since it would've shortened it a bit since there's no reason why this goes on for as long as it does, but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws. The Final Verdict: A lot better than expected, this one here has a lot more going on for it than the others and is one of the better entries. Give this one a shot if the series is entertaining or if there's something in it that appeals to you, otherwise then stick away from this one as there's a lot better ones out there.
