    My friend and I were in the local used book/movie store and we came across Chairman of the Board, knowing us we thought it would be a fun idea to get it and watch it to try and poke fun at carrot top and the rest of the crew. We were horribly wrong. Once opening the box containing the film the ambiance of the room changed to a dark and gloomy atmosphere, then we made the worse decision of our lives and put it in the DVD player. I have never once in my life felt such anger towards a film and those who were apart of making it. There is a special seat in hell for those who participated in making this movie, if you can even call it that! If I could have one with it would be to get those 95min of my life back that Carrot Top robbed from me. Please, for the sake and health of others if you find a copy of chairman of the board do the following instructions A.)Once finding it, pick it up with latex gloves. DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN B.)Go deep into your local forest or desert and pour gasoline all over it and throw a lite match or lighter on it C.) Once burnt dig a hole as deep as you can and bury it The fate of cinema and of the future lives of others is in our hands to abolish the world of this film. God speed my fellow IMDb users......God speed.

    With this film there are two options. It might be utterly brilliant and deserving o praise, or it might be an abomination worthy of burning on the stake like a Witch of the 17th century. How so you ask? It might be that Mr Top and his crew have done a mind blowing role reversal, that the antagonist has become our protagonist and vice versa. They have somehow taken the utterly despicable red head, the blundering, insensitive, idiotic jerk that is called Carrot Top - who clearly is the bad guy - and turned him into the main character, the hero even. The movie then becomes a deep dive into the psyche of this evil genius, showing us all the painful details of his demented schemes. If this was the case, Chairman of the Board would be a brilliant film but alas, the last third of the film points strongly to the other possibility; that the film makers made a mistake of epic proportions when they turned walking catastrophe Carrot Top into the character we are supposed to identify with and root for. With such a protagonist, every effort in the world would not be able to save this catastrophe.

    Tim Allen's successful TV series Home Improvement was inspired by his stand-up comedy. Seinfeld was inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy. This movie has ripped off the Flintstones Movie with its unoriginal originality, crappy unfunny jokes, and an actor who looks like one of the Muppets with an afro. This movie stars Carrot Top as a wannabe inventor who becomes, what else, Chairman of the Board. However, a villain played by Larry Miller wants to overthrow Carrot Top to become, what else, Chairman of the freaking Board! And I guess the movie is obsessed with Larry Miller's genitals because the camera loves to zoom in that part. Stupid jokes, no original ideas, a ripped off plot of the Flintstones, and the camera focusing on Larry Miller's numb nuts are the reasons why you shouldn't buy the DVD copy of Chairman of the Board.

    It takes a person with an open mind and a heart of gold to find Carrot Top funny and I'm one of those people. I've found Carrot Top's prop comedy to be somewhat clever and at other times unneeded. While I think a movie showcasing his style is a tiny bit much, this one did manage to squeeze a few laughs out of me and deliver the type of slapstick comedy I've always admired. Chris Farley, John Candy, and Carrot Top are all examples of people of my favorite Comedy films. This one is just a movie that knows it's pure goofy and doesn't want to be a film for the critics. It wants to go off on it's own and be the strange fest it was born to be. Chairman of the Board is the only Carrot Top film ever made. Not counting the cameo he had in the Dennis the Menace film, this is the only film he has ever had a starring role in. Due to the overwhelming negative reception that plagued this film upon release, the limited release, and the box office beating it took I'm not surprised Thompson (Carrot Top) didn't make another film. The downside to this is that it doesn't showcase Carrot Top's acting skills enough. This film is funny and can be fun at times, but Carrot Top's overactive personality and his jumpy attitude could easily anger the viewer. Which I believe is the prime complaint of this film. Carrot Top plays Edison, a surfer boy who loves inventing gizmos and gadgets that one day he hopes will change the world. It doesn't take a genius, or Edison for that matter, to realize why his name is after the famous inventor himself. Edison is quickly discovered by Armand McMillan, an money making inventor who works for a company called McMillan Industries and also find a way to coincidentally die before him and Edison become real close. Nonetheless, during the funeral using a video he made, Armand makes Edison the new "Chairman of the board" of McMillan Industries. Edison treats the job like a fast-food boy and screws around a whole lot. But like every protagonist who's this silly, they have a heart and they just want to express themselves. In a way, Edison reminds me of Fabio from the current season of Survivor: Nicaragua. He's not as dumb as people make him out to be an is truly very passionate, but many overlook that trait. Chairman of the Board is cited as one of the worst films of all time, and truth be told, it's not great. I did like Carrot Top on the other hand which is definitely the upside of this film. Just like his stand up/prop comedy, a lot of the jokes were hit and miss, but around 1/3 of the jokes worked which is more that could be said about films of similar style/approach like Busted. It's an amusing comedy, but not one to watch all the time. Starring: Carrot Top. Directed by: Alex Zamm.

    I have to admit, the only reason is an interview Courtney Thorne-Smith gave back in '98 on the Conan show (plugging this film) during which she had the misfortune to have Norm MacDonald as the preceding guest. He proceeded to excoriate this film, Carrot Top, and, by implication, the film industry, modern civilization, and the nature of existence itself with admirable aplomb. See here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0WayC7jW0 It's funnier than the film. MacDonald is incredible. He actually got me to watch a Carrot Top movie based on his sight-unseen opinion of the film. Courtney: "It's like 9 1/2 Weeks, but Carrot Top." Norm: "So, it's like 9 1/2 Seconds?" (long pause) "'Cause he prematurely ejaculated." Seriously, watch the interview.

    I have seen Carrot Top on TV, showing off his wacky inventions. I have never heard of this movie until I saw it on TV two years ago. Of course, critics hated it (of the few that saw it). But with him doing what he does, you can't or don't expect this movie to be the least bit realistic, right? I thought some of his gadgets here were pretty clever, although not necessarily funny. My only quibble is the movie's title. Couldn't and Shouldn't this movie instead be called: "Carrot Top: the Movie"? Or maybe something like "Wacky Genius". Carrot Top's character may be aspiring this position, but the title in or of itself doesn't really fit the tone of the film. Anyway, I found the movie a hoot. And actor Larry Miller is a hoot also. Yes, his character is obvious and predictable, bur so what? That's the kind of character you'll find in these types of comedies. *** out of ****

    Carrot Top is one of those actors who is the epitome of Andy Warhol's assertion that "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." Clearly, Mr. Top's claim to fame was very, very short-lived and the world's fascination of him expired long ago--probably long before this movie debuted! I think that this film's appearance on the infamous "IMDB Bottom 100" is due to this disaffection with the red-headed 'comic'. In other words, while the film IS bad, it's not as bad as its rating would suggest--and is more a reflection of the world being tired of Mr. Top than anything else. After all, a little bit of his shtick sure goes a long way! The film is very formulaic and the plot is basically the same as Weird Al's film "UHF"--except that "UHF" is very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is tired and occasionally tedious film. Now that I think about it, the plot is a lot like Steve Martin's "The Jerk"--which was also very, very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is a dull pile of bat droppings. Mr. Top is an out of work guy who makes crazy and generally useless inventions (wow--that's a radical departure from his stage routine). Despite this, he IS able to make it big because he meets up with a nice old guy (Jack Warden--who deserved better than this) who unknown to Herr Top is the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. When Warden dies, he leaves the company to the Top-Meister. Warden's nephew, Larry Miller (who does not deserve better than this) wants the company himself and decides to work behind Topper's back to ruin the company's stock so he can take over the company. Sadly for Miller, La Zanahoria's crazy inventions work out great--making the company more successful than ever before...but Miller has an evil plan.... As I said above, the basic plot idea, while recycled, is workable. The problem is all the fart jokes, crotch jokes and the fact you see so much of the Carrot that the film is ponderous and rarely charming. The bottom line is that if the leading man had been a bit actor instead of THE film it might have worked...providing the film also had writers who were not chimps. All in all, pretty dopey but watchable...and not nearly as horrible as the really, really bad films of William Grefe, Al Adamson, Ed Wood, Larry Buchanan, Arch Hall, Sr. or Ray Dennis Steckler!! Now these guys really, really, really made bad films--apocalytically bad films!! By the way, there was one very good thing about the film--seriously. The surfer-inspired music (including a great song from the Ramones) made this a terrific soundtrack--one of the best in recent memory. Really.

    Edison is a genius who has a talent for inventing crazy gadgets. He seems to be able to make a living at it, though he lives with two friends on the beach where he can surf. Eventually, Edison is fired because he doesn't produce enough money for the company. Fortunately, the slightly eccentric Armand McMillan also likes to surf, and he and Edison become friends. When McMillan dies, he puts Edison in charge of the company. This does not please the more conservative big shots, who plot to get rid of Edison. The results are predictable but also enjoyable. I was surprised at how much I liked Carrot Top in this movie. I can't stand him normally, but he did a capable job and made his character likable. Jack Warden was also impressive considering the material. Courtney Thorne-Smith was cute. I was thinking she is a respected actress, but I'm not sure, and this movie doesn't prove anything. She wasn't bad here. Yes, this is a live-action cartoon, but it's a lot of fun. The visual effects and the gadgets are pretty good. I'm not sure I would recommend this to children because of the off-color humor (the movie opens with two girls in bed with Edison--or does it?). This is unfortunate since it has a limited audience if kids can't watch it. But there are plenty of us who enjoyed Saturday mornings as a kid and still like silly fun even though we're supposedly grown up.

    People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same type of people that see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top funny? Of course not. Was this movie anything special? Of course not. It was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and pretty much any movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think Carrot Top is hilarious. Please people if you ready know Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

    This movie is excellent. Carrot Top did an excellent job as Edison. He is my favorite comedian. He is a great comedian. He's also a genius. Edison is a great inventor who nobody cares to acknowledge because they have egos too big. But then he meets a man named Armand who loves his ideas and inventions. Then when Armand dies Edison inherits money and his company from him. All goes well until the bastard nephew tries to destroy Edison by foil his ideas in an evil plot and plan to take over. But will it really work? The truth is yours to find out!

Jack Warden was also impressive considering the material. Courtney Thorne-Smith was cute. I was thinking she is a respected actress, but I'm not sure, and this movie doesn't prove anything. She wasn't bad here. Yes, this is a live-action cartoon, but it's a lot of fun. The visual effects and the gadgets are pretty good. I'm not sure I would recommend this to children because of the off-color humor (the movie opens with two girls in bed with Edison--or does it?). This is unfortunate since it has a limited audience if kids can't watch it. But there are plenty of us who enjoyed Saturday mornings as a kid and still like silly fun even though we're supposedly grown up.

    People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same type of people that see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top funny? Of course not. Was this movie anything special? Of course not. It was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and pretty much any movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think Carrot Top is hilarious. Please people if you ready know Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

    This movie is excellent. Carrot Top did an excellent job as Edison. He is my favorite comedian. He is a great comedian. He's also a genius. Edison is a great inventor who nobody cares to acknowledge because they have egos too big. But then he meets a man named Armand who loves his ideas and inventions. Then when Armand dies Edison inherits money and his company from him. All goes well until the bastard nephew tries to destroy Edison by foil his ideas in an evil plot and plan to take over. But will it really work? The truth is yours to find out!

    My friend and I were in the local used book/movie store and we came across Chairman of the Board, knowing us we thought it would be a fun idea to get it and watch it to try and poke fun at carrot top and the rest of the crew. We were horribly wrong. Once opening the box containing the film the ambiance of the room changed to a dark and gloomy atmosphere, then we made the worse decision of our lives and put it in the DVD player. I have never once in my life felt such anger towards a film and those who were apart of making it. There is a special seat in hell for those who participated in making this movie, if you can even call it that! If I could have one with it would be to get those 95min of my life back that Carrot Top robbed from me. Please, for the sake and health of others if you find a copy of chairman of the board do the following instructions A.)Once finding it, pick it up with latex gloves. DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN B.)Go deep into your local forest or desert and pour gasoline all over it and throw a lite match or lighter on it C.) Once burnt dig a hole as deep as you can and bury it The fate of cinema and of the future lives of others is in our hands to abolish the world of this film. God speed my fellow IMDb users......God speed.

    With this film there are two options. It might be utterly brilliant and deserving o praise, or it might be an abomination worthy of burning on the stake like a Witch of the 17th century. How so you ask? It might be that Mr Top and his crew have done a mind blowing role reversal, that the antagonist has become our protagonist and vice versa. They have somehow taken the utterly despicable red head, the blundering, insensitive, idiotic jerk that is called Carrot Top - who clearly is the bad guy - and turned him into the main character, the hero even. The movie then becomes a deep dive into the psyche of this evil genius, showing us all the painful details of his demented schemes. If this was the case, Chairman of the Board would be a brilliant film but alas, the last third of the film points strongly to the other possibility; that the film makers made a mistake of epic proportions when they turned walking catastrophe Carrot Top into the character we are supposed to identify with and root for. With such a protagonist, every effort in the world would not be able to save this catastrophe.

    Tim Allen's successful TV series Home Improvement was inspired by his stand-up comedy. Seinfeld was inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy. This movie has ripped off the Flintstones Movie with its unoriginal originality, crappy unfunny jokes, and an actor who looks like one of the Muppets with an afro. This movie stars Carrot Top as a wannabe inventor who becomes, what else, Chairman of the Board. However, a villain played by Larry Miller wants to overthrow Carrot Top to become, what else, Chairman of the freaking Board! And I guess the movie is obsessed with Larry Miller's genitals because the camera loves to zoom in that part. Stupid jokes, no original ideas, a ripped off plot of the Flintstones, and the camera focusing on Larry Miller's numb nuts are the reasons why you shouldn't buy the DVD copy of Chairman of the Board.

    It takes a person with an open mind and a heart of gold to find Carrot Top funny and I'm one of those people. I've found Carrot Top's prop comedy to be somewhat clever and at other times unneeded. While I think a movie showcasing his style is a tiny bit much, this one did manage to squeeze a few laughs out of me and deliver the type of slapstick comedy I've always admired. Chris Farley, John Candy, and Carrot Top are all examples of people of my favorite Comedy films. This one is just a movie that knows it's pure goofy and doesn't want to be a film for the critics. It wants to go off on it's own and be the strange fest it was born to be. Chairman of the Board is the only Carrot Top film ever made. Not counting the cameo he had in the Dennis the Menace film, this is the only film he has ever had a starring role in. Due to the overwhelming negative reception that plagued this film upon release, the limited release, and the box office beating it took I'm not surprised Thompson (Carrot Top) didn't make another film. The downside to this is that it doesn't showcase Carrot Top's acting skills enough. This film is funny and can be fun at times, but Carrot Top's overactive personality and his jumpy attitude could easily anger the viewer. Which I believe is the prime complaint of this film. Carrot Top plays Edison, a surfer boy who loves inventing gizmos and gadgets that one day he hopes will change the world. It doesn't take a genius, or Edison for that matter, to realize why his name is after the famous inventor himself. Edison is quickly discovered by Armand McMillan, an money making inventor who works for a company called McMillan Industries and also find a way to coincidentally die before him and Edison become real close. Nonetheless, during the funeral using a video he made, Armand makes Edison the new "Chairman of the board" of McMillan Industries. Edison treats the job like a fast-food boy and screws around a whole lot. But like every protagonist who's this silly, they have a heart and they just want to express themselves. In a way, Edison reminds me of Fabio from the current season of Survivor: Nicaragua. He's not as dumb as people make him out to be an is truly very passionate, but many overlook that trait. Chairman of the Board is cited as one of the worst films of all time, and truth be told, it's not great. I did like Carrot Top on the other hand which is definitely the upside of this film. Just like his stand up/prop comedy, a lot of the jokes were hit and miss, but around 1/3 of the jokes worked which is more that could be said about films of similar style/approach like Busted. It's an amusing comedy, but not one to watch all the time. Starring: Carrot Top. Directed by: Alex Zamm.

    I have to admit, the only reason is an interview Courtney Thorne-Smith gave back in '98 on the Conan show (plugging this film) during which she had the misfortune to have Norm MacDonald as the preceding guest. He proceeded to excoriate this film, Carrot Top, and, by implication, the film industry, modern civilization, and the nature of existence itself with admirable aplomb. See here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0WayC7jW0 It's funnier than the film. MacDonald is incredible. He actually got me to watch a Carrot Top movie based on his sight-unseen opinion of the film. Courtney: "It's like 9 1/2 Weeks, but Carrot Top." Norm: "So, it's like 9 1/2 Seconds?" (long pause) "'Cause he prematurely ejaculated." Seriously, watch the interview.

    I have seen Carrot Top on TV, showing off his wacky inventions. I have never heard of this movie until I saw it on TV two years ago. Of course, critics hated it (of the few that saw it). But with him doing what he does, you can't or don't expect this movie to be the least bit realistic, right? I thought some of his gadgets here were pretty clever, although not necessarily funny. My only quibble is the movie's title. Couldn't and Shouldn't this movie instead be called: "Carrot Top: the Movie"? Or maybe something like "Wacky Genius". Carrot Top's character may be aspiring this position, but the title in or of itself doesn't really fit the tone of the film. Anyway, I found the movie a hoot. And actor Larry Miller is a hoot also. Yes, his character is obvious and predictable, bur so what? That's the kind of character you'll find in these types of comedies. *** out of ****

    Carrot Top is one of those actors who is the epitome of Andy Warhol's assertion that "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." Clearly, Mr. Top's claim to fame was very, very short-lived and the world's fascination of him expired long ago--probably long before this movie debuted! I think that this film's appearance on the infamous "IMDB Bottom 100" is due to this disaffection with the red-headed 'comic'. In other words, while the film IS bad, it's not as bad as its rating would suggest--and is more a reflection of the world being tired of Mr. Top than anything else. After all, a little bit of his shtick sure goes a long way! The film is very formulaic and the plot is basically the same as Weird Al's film "UHF"--except that "UHF" is very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is tired and occasionally tedious film. Now that I think about it, the plot is a lot like Steve Martin's "The Jerk"--which was also very, very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is a dull pile of bat droppings. Mr. Top is an out of work guy who makes crazy and generally useless inventions (wow--that's a radical departure from his stage routine). Despite this, he IS able to make it big because he meets up with a nice old guy (Jack Warden--who deserved better than this) who unknown to Herr Top is the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. When Warden dies, he leaves the company to the Top-Meister. Warden's nephew, Larry Miller (who does not deserve better than this) wants the company himself and decides to work behind Topper's back to ruin the company's stock so he can take over the company. Sadly for Miller, La Zanahoria's crazy inventions work out great--making the company more successful than ever before...but Miller has an evil plan.... As I said above, the basic plot idea, while recycled, is workable. The problem is all the fart jokes, crotch jokes and the fact you see so much of the Carrot that the film is ponderous and rarely charming. The bottom line is that if the leading man had been a bit actor instead of THE film it might have worked...providing the film also had writers who were not chimps. All in all, pretty dopey but watchable...and not nearly as horrible as the really, really bad films of William Grefe, Al Adamson, Ed Wood, Larry Buchanan, Arch Hall, Sr. or Ray Dennis Steckler!! Now these guys really, really, really made bad films--apocalytically bad films!! By the way, there was one very good thing about the film--seriously. The surfer-inspired music (including a great song from the Ramones) made this a terrific soundtrack--one of the best in recent memory. Really.

    Edison is a genius who has a talent for inventing crazy gadgets. He seems to be able to make a living at it, though he lives with two friends on the beach where he can surf. Eventually, Edison is fired because he doesn't produce enough money for the company. Fortunately, the slightly eccentric Armand McMillan also likes to surf, and he and Edison become friends. When McMillan dies, he puts Edison in charge of the company. This does not please the more conservative big shots, who plot to get rid of Edison. The results are predictable but also enjoyable. I was surprised at how much I liked Carrot Top in this movie. I can't stand him normally, but he did a capable job and made his character likable.

This is unfortunate since it has a limited audience if kids can't watch it.

Now these guys really, really, really made bad films--apocalytically bad films!! By the way, there was one very good thing about the film--seriously. The surfer-inspired music (including a great song from the Ramones) made this a terrific soundtrack--one of the best in recent memory. Really.

    Edison is a genius who has a talent for inventing crazy gadgets. He seems to be able to make a living at it, though he lives with two friends on the beach where he can surf. Eventually, Edison is fired because he doesn't produce enough money for the company. Fortunately, the slightly eccentric Armand McMillan also likes to surf, and he and Edison become friends. When McMillan dies, he puts Edison in charge of the company. This does not please the more conservative big shots, who plot to get rid of Edison. The results are predictable but also enjoyable. I was surprised at how much I liked Carrot Top in this movie. I can't stand him normally, but he did a capable job and made his character likable. Jack Warden was also impressive considering the material. Courtney Thorne-Smith was cute. I was thinking she is a respected actress, but I'm not sure, and this movie doesn't prove anything. She wasn't bad here. Yes, this is a live-action cartoon, but it's a lot of fun. The visual effects and the gadgets are pretty good. I'm not sure I would recommend this to children because of the off-color humor (the movie opens with two girls in bed with Edison--or does it?). This is unfortunate since it has a limited audience if kids can't watch it. But there are plenty of us who enjoyed Saturday mornings as a kid and still like silly fun even though we're supposedly grown up.

    People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same type of people that see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top funny? Of course not. Was this movie anything special? Of course not. It was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and pretty much any movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think Carrot Top is hilarious. Please people if you ready know Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

    This movie is excellent. Carrot Top did an excellent job as Edison. He is my favorite comedian. He is a great comedian. He's also a genius. Edison is a great inventor who nobody cares to acknowledge because they have egos too big. But then he meets a man named Armand who loves his ideas and inventions. Then when Armand dies Edison inherits money and his company from him. All goes well until the bastard nephew tries to destroy Edison by foil his ideas in an evil plot and plan to take over. But will it really work? The truth is yours to find out!

    My friend and I were in the local used book/movie store and we came across Chairman of the Board, knowing us we thought it would be a fun idea to get it and watch it to try and poke fun at carrot top and the rest of the crew. We were horribly wrong. Once opening the box containing the film the ambiance of the room changed to a dark and gloomy atmosphere, then we made the worse decision of our lives and put it in the DVD player. I have never once in my life felt such anger towards a film and those who were apart of making it. There is a special seat in hell for those who participated in making this movie, if you can even call it that! If I could have one with it would be to get those 95min of my life back that Carrot Top robbed from me. Please, for the sake and health of others if you find a copy of chairman of the board do the following instructions A.)Once finding it, pick it up with latex gloves. DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN B.)Go deep into your local forest or desert and pour gasoline all over it and throw a lite match or lighter on it C.) Once burnt dig a hole as deep as you can and bury it The fate of cinema and of the future lives of others is in our hands to abolish the world of this film. God speed my fellow IMDb users......God speed.

    With this film there are two options. It might be utterly brilliant and deserving o praise, or it might be an abomination worthy of burning on the stake like a Witch of the 17th century. How so you ask? It might be that Mr Top and his crew have done a mind blowing role reversal, that the antagonist has become our protagonist and vice versa. They have somehow taken the utterly despicable red head, the blundering, insensitive, idiotic jerk that is called Carrot Top - who clearly is the bad guy - and turned him into the main character, the hero even. The movie then becomes a deep dive into the psyche of this evil genius, showing us all the painful details of his demented schemes. If this was the case, Chairman of the Board would be a brilliant film but alas, the last third of the film points strongly to the other possibility; that the film makers made a mistake of epic proportions when they turned walking catastrophe Carrot Top into the character we are supposed to identify with and root for. With such a protagonist, every effort in the world would not be able to save this catastrophe.

    Tim Allen's successful TV series Home Improvement was inspired by his stand-up comedy. Seinfeld was inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy. This movie has ripped off the Flintstones Movie with its unoriginal originality, crappy unfunny jokes, and an actor who looks like one of the Muppets with an afro. This movie stars Carrot Top as a wannabe inventor who becomes, what else, Chairman of the Board. However, a villain played by Larry Miller wants to overthrow Carrot Top to become, what else, Chairman of the freaking Board! And I guess the movie is obsessed with Larry Miller's genitals because the camera loves to zoom in that part. Stupid jokes, no original ideas, a ripped off plot of the Flintstones, and the camera focusing on Larry Miller's numb nuts are the reasons why you shouldn't buy the DVD copy of Chairman of the Board.

    It takes a person with an open mind and a heart of gold to find Carrot Top funny and I'm one of those people. I've found Carrot Top's prop comedy to be somewhat clever and at other times unneeded. While I think a movie showcasing his style is a tiny bit much, this one did manage to squeeze a few laughs out of me and deliver the type of slapstick comedy I've always admired. Chris Farley, John Candy, and Carrot Top are all examples of people of my favorite Comedy films. This one is just a movie that knows it's pure goofy and doesn't want to be a film for the critics. It wants to go off on it's own and be the strange fest it was born to be. Chairman of the Board is the only Carrot Top film ever made. Not counting the cameo he had in the Dennis the Menace film, this is the only film he has ever had a starring role in. Due to the overwhelming negative reception that plagued this film upon release, the limited release, and the box office beating it took I'm not surprised Thompson (Carrot Top) didn't make another film. The downside to this is that it doesn't showcase Carrot Top's acting skills enough. This film is funny and can be fun at times, but Carrot Top's overactive personality and his jumpy attitude could easily anger the viewer. Which I believe is the prime complaint of this film. Carrot Top plays Edison, a surfer boy who loves inventing gizmos and gadgets that one day he hopes will change the world. It doesn't take a genius, or Edison for that matter, to realize why his name is after the famous inventor himself. Edison is quickly discovered by Armand McMillan, an money making inventor who works for a company called McMillan Industries and also find a way to coincidentally die before him and Edison become real close. Nonetheless, during the funeral using a video he made, Armand makes Edison the new "Chairman of the board" of McMillan Industries. Edison treats the job like a fast-food boy and screws around a whole lot. But like every protagonist who's this silly, they have a heart and they just want to express themselves. In a way, Edison reminds me of Fabio from the current season of Survivor: Nicaragua. He's not as dumb as people make him out to be an is truly very passionate, but many overlook that trait. Chairman of the Board is cited as one of the worst films of all time, and truth be told, it's not great. I did like Carrot Top on the other hand which is definitely the upside of this film. Just like his stand up/prop comedy, a lot of the jokes were hit and miss, but around 1/3 of the jokes worked which is more that could be said about films of similar style/approach like Busted. It's an amusing comedy, but not one to watch all the time. Starring: Carrot Top. Directed by: Alex Zamm.

    I have to admit, the only reason is an interview Courtney Thorne-Smith gave back in '98 on the Conan show (plugging this film) during which she had the misfortune to have Norm MacDonald as the preceding guest. He proceeded to excoriate this film, Carrot Top, and, by implication, the film industry, modern civilization, and the nature of existence itself with admirable aplomb. See here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0WayC7jW0 It's funnier than the film. MacDonald is incredible. He actually got me to watch a Carrot Top movie based on his sight-unseen opinion of the film. Courtney: "It's like 9 1/2 Weeks, but Carrot Top." Norm: "So, it's like 9 1/2 Seconds?" (long pause) "'Cause he prematurely ejaculated." Seriously, watch the interview.

    I have seen Carrot Top on TV, showing off his wacky inventions. I have never heard of this movie until I saw it on TV two years ago. Of course, critics hated it (of the few that saw it). But with him doing what he does, you can't or don't expect this movie to be the least bit realistic, right? I thought some of his gadgets here were pretty clever, although not necessarily funny. My only quibble is the movie's title. Couldn't and Shouldn't this movie instead be called: "Carrot Top: the Movie"? Or maybe something like "Wacky Genius". Carrot Top's character may be aspiring this position, but the title in or of itself doesn't really fit the tone of the film. Anyway, I found the movie a hoot. And actor Larry Miller is a hoot also. Yes, his character is obvious and predictable, bur so what? That's the kind of character you'll find in these types of comedies. *** out of ****

    Carrot Top is one of those actors who is the epitome of Andy Warhol's assertion that "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." Clearly, Mr. Top's claim to fame was very, very short-lived and the world's fascination of him expired long ago--probably long before this movie debuted! I think that this film's appearance on the infamous "IMDB Bottom 100" is due to this disaffection with the red-headed 'comic'. In other words, while the film IS bad, it's not as bad as its rating would suggest--and is more a reflection of the world being tired of Mr. Top than anything else. After all, a little bit of his shtick sure goes a long way! The film is very formulaic and the plot is basically the same as Weird Al's film "UHF"--except that "UHF" is very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is tired and occasionally tedious film. Now that I think about it, the plot is a lot like Steve Martin's "The Jerk"--which was also very, very funny and "Chairman of the Board" is a dull pile of bat droppings. Mr. Top is an out of work guy who makes crazy and generally useless inventions (wow--that's a radical departure from his stage routine). Despite this, he IS able to make it big because he meets up with a nice old guy (Jack Warden--who deserved better than this) who unknown to Herr Top is the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. When Warden dies, he leaves the company to the Top-Meister. Warden's nephew, Larry Miller (who does not deserve better than this) wants the company himself and decides to work behind Topper's back to ruin the company's stock so he can take over the company. Sadly for Miller, La Zanahoria's crazy inventions work out great--making the company more successful than ever before...but Miller has an evil plan.... As I said above, the basic plot idea, while recycled, is workable. The problem is all the fart jokes, crotch jokes and the fact you see so much of the Carrot that the film is ponderous and rarely charming. The bottom line is that if the leading man had been a bit actor instead of THE film it might have worked...providing the film also had writers who were not chimps. All in all, pretty dopey but watchable...and not nearly as horrible as the really, really bad films of William Grefe, Al Adamson, Ed Wood, Larry Buchanan, Arch Hall, Sr. or Ray Dennis Steckler!! Now these guys really, really, really made bad films--apocalytically bad films!! By the way, there was one very good thing about the film--seriously. The surfer-inspired music (including a great song from the Ramones) made this a terrific soundtrack--one of the best in recent memory. Really.

Mr. Top is an out of work guy who makes crazy and generally useless inventions (wow--that's a radical departure from his stage routine). Despite this, he IS able to make it big because he meets up with a nice old guy (Jack Warden--who deserved better than this) who unknown to Herr Top is the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. When Warden dies, he leaves the company to the Top-Meister. Warden's nephew, Larry Miller (who does not deserve better than this) wants the company himself and decides to work behind Topper's back to ruin the company's stock so he can take over the company. Sadly for Miller, La Zanahoria's crazy inventions work out great--making the company more successful than ever before...but Miller has an evil plan.... As I said above, the basic plot idea, while recycled, is workable. The problem is all the fart jokes, crotch jokes and the fact you see so much of the Carrot that the film is ponderous and rarely charming. The bottom line is that if the leading man had been a bit actor instead of THE film it might have worked...providing the film also had writers who were not chimps. All in all, pretty dopey but watchable...and not nearly as horrible as the really, really bad films of William Grefe, Al Adamson, Ed Wood, Larry Buchanan, Arch Hall, Sr. or Ray Dennis Steckler!! Now these guys really, really, really made bad films--apocalytically bad films!! By the way, there was one very good thing about the film--seriously. The surfer-inspired music (including a great song from the Ramones) made this a terrific soundtrack--one of the best in recent memory. Really.

    Edison is a genius who has a talent for inventing crazy gadgets. He seems to be able to make a living at it, though he lives with two friends on the beach where he can surf. Eventually, Edison is fired because he doesn't produce enough money for the company. Fortunately, the slightly eccentric Armand McMillan also likes to surf, and he and Edison become friends. When McMillan dies, he puts Edison in charge of the company. This does not please the more conservative big shots, who plot to get rid of Edison. The results are predictable but also enjoyable. I was surprised at how much I liked Carrot Top in this movie. I can't stand him normally, but he did a capable job and made his character likable. Jack Warden was also impressive considering the material. Courtney Thorne-Smith was cute. I was thinking she is a respected actress, but I'm not sure, and this movie doesn't prove anything. She wasn't bad here. Yes, this is a live-action cartoon, but it's a lot of fun. The visual effects and the gadgets are pretty good. I'm not sure I would recommend this to children because of the off-color humor (the movie opens with two girls in bed with Edison--or does it?). This is unfortunate since it has a limited audience if kids can't watch it. But there are plenty of us who enjoyed Saturday mornings as a kid and still like silly fun even though we're supposedly grown up.

    People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same type of people that see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top funny? Of course not. Was this movie anything special? Of course not. It was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and pretty much any movie Pauly Shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think Carrot Top is hilarious. Please people if you ready know Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

    This movie is excellent. Carrot Top did an excellent job as Edison. He is my favorite comedian. He is a great comedian. He's also a genius. Edison is a great inventor who nobody cares to acknowledge because they have egos too big. But then he meets a man named Armand who loves his ideas and inventions. Then when Armand dies Edison inherits money and his company from him. All goes well until the bastard nephew tries to destroy Edison by foil his ideas in an evil plot and plan to take over. But will it really work? The truth is yours to find out!
