    Writer/director Michael Rymer's strong, realistic script and profound performances from John Lynch and Jacqueline McKenzie ensure "Angel Baby" is an impacting drama about two schizophrenic out-patients who begin a relationship and plan to start a family. Rymer has researched his material well, and this shows in the tellingly accurate screenplay and the sharply observed characters. John Lynch is superb as Harry, a mentally ill fellow who falls immediately for Kate, the bizarre young woman who consults a spiritual guide (her guardian angel who communicates with her through t.v.'s "Wheel of Fortune") for any decision she faces or information she needs. As the said Kate, McKenzie is incredible and has you completely absorbed with her amazing characterisation. The impressive support cast includes Colin Friels, Deborah Lee-Furness and David Argue. For all it's merits though, "Angel Baby" seems to have no point. Perhaps it is just a quiet statement about the prejudices society holds against the mentally ill, especially those who suffer from schizophrenia. Certainly Rymer never attempts to drive a point home. This can often make for a more enjoyable movie, but "Angel Baby's" hope-less ending, though moving, rather leaves its audience floundering. Tragically Mr. Rymer has killed off what was, up until then, a great movie with too realistic a conclusion, much as Peter Weir did with "Dead Poet's Society". Pic's other problem involves relating to the audience. Two fabulous performances and incisive writing can never help us get inside the skin of people we do not understand. Little explanation as to the origin of their illnesses, or even of the illness itself, is given, making it hard for us to comprehend the whys and wherefores. Of course the reality of schizophrenia is, we don't really understand it very well at all. There is surely much more to it than we know. Monday, June 2, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon

    Some films pull on your heart strings. This one rips them out. One of the most endearing and powerful films that stays in obscurity. If you like heavy romantic films with intense soundtracks and don't want to leave your movie-going experience the same - take a roller-coaster ride with this sometimes funny, sometimes hopeful and unrelentingly heartbreaking work of art. From it's comical beginning it's prepares you for something along the lines of Shaun of the Dead or Monty Python, lifts you up with laughter. You become drunk. Stupid drunk. Then the bottom drops. Powerful and flawless

    The issue presented in the Australian movie 'Angel Baby' is one that is very close to me. I am talking about mental illness and how destructive any of them can be to individuals that get it. I have been affected by both depression and a mild case of schizophrenia (the illness that is shown here) and the highs and lows that come with those illnesses. This film is important as shows what it takes to overcome a mental illness and what affects they can have on your life and those around you. A funny, haunting love story, 'Angel Baby' tells the story of two lost souls, Harry and Kate, who fall in love against the odds and find hope strength in each other to accomplish the impossible. Full of humour, compassion and hope, Angel Baby is a testament to the power of love and a roller-coaster journey to the magical fringes of the human psyche. There is a lot to like about and take in with this movie. The writer /director Michael Rymer has bought a very interesting Australian movie to our screen. The story that we get here is one that is probably not all that uncommon, but is not known in our community. It accentuates the difficulties that people have when they are battling any mental illness and what rash choices they make when they are unable function mentally. This story also had the wonderful aspects that show Kate's obsessions of seeing messages from a TV game-show, while I am glad that the story shows both Kate and Harry choosing a life that they are probably not able to keep in complete control of because of their mental illness issues. Then as director, Rymer makes some very impressive moves. I love how the movie makes us as the audience feel like we are experiencing what the mental illness is like that both Kate and Harry actually have. I believe this mainly through the extraordinary camera work that is used, with all of its different views and angles. This aspect of the movie is helped by its cinematographer Ellery Ryan, who captures it all perfectly. I also love the choice of scenery used in 'Angel Baby', such as the shots of the city and the grand 'West gate bridge', which is used to great effect in the film. The leading cast to this movie was outstanding. Harry (John Lynch) and Kate (Jacqueline Mackenzie) are wonderful on screen together. They were both very convincing as both very mentally ill patients and it is through their performances that I believe this. There were some very real moments (well that is what they felt like for me) in this film where I believed these actors were suffering a mental illness for real. One such incident is when Kate is totally taken aback by being hit by kid skate-boarding at the local shopping centre. What I saw was a haunting sort of vision, one that I can relate to, and one that I was glad too see. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well. Harry has concerned friends, the Goodman's. Morris (Colin Friels) and Louise (Deborra-Lee Furness) both show at individual times that they are truly concerned with the situation they find Harry and his girl in. Their son, Sam Goodman, (Daniel Daperis) was another important character, who has a terrific scene with Harry, about being unable to sleep one. What Harry helps Sam out with is ironic, considering the situation that we see Harry gets himself into. I watched Angel Baby and 'Cosi', (another Australian movie, which deals with mental illness) back to back. Cosi was not as good as Angel Baby in my view, but the two films are completely different. One is from a totally serious point of view, while the other is coming from the comedic perspective about mental illness. I am still yet to see the classic Australian film 'Shine', starring Geoffrey Rush. But from what I have been told, it must be another worthwhile movie about how mental illness affects people, even brilliant and successful individuals. I am a firm believer that mental illness is an issue in society that is culturally misunderstood by most people. I believe this because people are either misinformed or misdiagnosed, or they immediately dismiss a person with such a problem, saying either 'they are making excuses for themselves' or 'they should just snap out of it'. I personally hate that point of view as it is not only arrogant, but it is also a very na&iuml;ve point of view in my opinion. I say that compassion should be shown instead of criticism, while understanding and sensitivity should be learnt instead of straight dismissal and sheer arrogance. I guess my only criticism of Angel Baby is that it has a very limited cast, but perhaps that was a deliberate move, to show both Harry and Kate, for as long as they could. I would have preferred a bit bigger cast. I am glad that we were able to see all sorts of ideas, visions and images presented about how mental illness can affect people in 'Angel Baby', and are eternally grateful that an Australian movie is willing and daring enough to show it. For that, I thank the makers and actors from the bottom of my heart. CMRS gives 'Angel Baby': 4.5 (Very Good Â– Brilliant Film)

    When I first saw this film, I felt torn apart by the complexity of love. In particular, the love that exists between the lead characters. It is hard enough in the "real world" for people to have a love without the interference of others. In this film, the love story is exceptional. The two people have schizophrenia, an illness not of split personality, but of hallucinations that don't exist & voices that are heard but have no face. So, under all this still lies the human need for love. And these two people find it. Pure & simplified. Until things start to go wrong again. The challenges that faced the lead actors was to make believable both their love story & their illness. In particular, Jacqueline McKenzie is an amazing & articulate actor & remains true to her character's situation & beliefs throughout the film. I decided to make a point of mentioning the film for it's true portrayal of a greatly misunderstood & yet common illness. For all the films about cancer, alcoholism & other illnesses, mental illnesses are still generally misunderstood & ignorantly ill-portrayed. Previous to "A Beautiful Mind", this is one of the films that portrays this illness both realistically beautifully, and for those reasons alone it can help people to understand more about an illness that most probably affects someone you know.

    Little Aussie sleeper of a movie that takes on the challenging premise of love among the mentally retarded and handles all sides of the issue with surprising sensitivity and aplomb. All the key aspects from writing to directing to acting to editing are top drawer. This is a well intentioned and serious effort. Still, the subject matter is a tough one... I saw it at a preview screening and probably wouldn't have attended had I known what I was going to see. Still, I'm glad I saw it. Don't go in expecting fun and games or you will not be pleased. A hybrid of CHARLY, David AND LISA and SHINE but don't count on a happy ending. It's a classy, poignant, earnest and worthwhile effort, but ultimately, a bit of a buzz kill. 8.5/10

    I saw this movie recently and enjoyed it very much. It is a truly beautiful love story. I am an RN and I think the characters schitzophrenia and the activities of The Clubhouse and the hospital are realistically portrayed. John Lynch is absolutely adorable. I like Jacqueline MacKenzie, too. I can't believe that she is the same girl who was in Romper Stomper. (That movie is worth watching too.) I loved the music from this movie especially "On Your Shore" by Enya. It was the perfect music choice for the scene it is used in. This movie is definitely worth seeing once and is better the second time when you've got the accents down.

    Stunning, heartfelt film by little-known director Rymer is most notable for brilliant performances by Lynch and McKenzie, the latter in her best role ever. Maltin called it (incredibly) `over-elaborate treatment of the subject matter' - it's quite the opposite, as mental illness is far too often swept under the carpet in today's society. Friels' character is expertly written, as a brother who cares for his troubled sibling but can't offer any solution, and who doesn't want his family being dragged into Harry's problems. The film's significance was reflected in its performance at the AFI Awards.

    If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one,and well worth exploring.However on the negative side,the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses,and the music choices more and more bizarre,so that by the end I found myself laughing when I know the director intended for me to be crying.

    I don't know enough about psychosis to comment on the accuracy of the film, but it was certainly convincing to me. I can only hope that Australian society is as sympathetic as it is presented here. As a matter of fact, my personal contact with a psychotic showed American society off the screen much more civilized than Hollywood does. All the actors come through well, but my prize would go to the woman. Some may think the ending a cheap shot, but it's hard to stop a realistic film from going on forever.
