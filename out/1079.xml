    I went into Joe's Apartment I was expecting a crappy film, not going to lie. It was lampooned by critics, and is the first of it's kind as it's the first film by MTV. I saw bits and pieces of this flick when I was around eight years old with my dad, and thought it was a horror film. Thousands of cockroaches and their scratchy voices running around a ceiling kicking two guy's asses sounds like a Horror film. I was surprised to find out it was a comedy film by none other than MTV. After all, this was all when I was eight. Like I stated, I went into this expecting a horrible film. It looked like a cheesy MTV film that lacked talent and humor. I was totally wrong. This film is now on the list of favorite MTV films. I always complain in my other reviews that movies have lost creativity and idea in recent years, I think I got what I asked for. Singing cockroaches? Haven't seen that done before! Joe (O'Connell) is a College grad who is having a hard time after moving to New York City. He can't find a place or a job to manage. After posing as a recently dead elderly women's son, he is able to get her Apartment at very cheap. Little does he know the podunk joint is home to over 5,000 singing and talking cockroaches. Joe must now cope with the roaches irrational behavior, as well as trying to score big with a local, garden nut named Lily (Ward). But there isn't a huge market for women who dig jobless men who have a home infested with thousands of cockroaches last I checked. I could be wrong though. I have seen the original short that this film is based on, and I hate cockroaches. Though seeing cheesy beta versions of themselves somehow made me tolerate them for 80 minutes. Plus Jerry O'Connell's likable persona was something that flowed nicely throughout the film. Joe's Apartment crosses the line of disgusting and becomes utterly filled with gross out humor and repulsive scenery of Joe's apartment. But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment. Gives me an idea for my fourth short film. Starring: Jerry O'Connell, Megan Ward, Billy West, Robert Vaughn, Reginald Hudlin, Jim Turner, and Don Ho. Directed by: John Payson.

    I watched this movie a while back, and I have just Yesterday watched it again. For a movie made back then, I'm sort of impressed. The animations were pretty good, the acting was fine, the story was okay, but the humor was really good! I rate it so low because of the lack of stuff going on. Main character trying to fit into the new town. Normal story. Finds a girl, something bad happens, they soon meet up and everyone's happy. My favorite scenes were those with the animations and the interaction the actor had with them. Must be tough! And that constant swearing... goodness!

    This movie was a different one. But in every way possible was entertaining. I would give this a 6/10 at the least because it was a very different kind of story, but the acting for some characters could have been better, in my opinion. This is a great film for a more mature audiences simply because of its sexual humor and harsh language, which there is a lot of. But none the less, this was a fantastic movie, with a bunch of slap-stick humor, so anyone who loves this kind of humor should definitely watch. Also if your going to watch this film, be ready for some weird scenes and musical parts, because that is kind of what this movie is mostly put of. But overall, if your in the mood for a great slap-stick humor film, go watch Joe's Apartment.

    I absolutely detest roaches. Effing can't stand them, which is why the movie is a success. Making what I think to be one of the most disgusting creatures on Earth to be endearing, lovable characters was a huge stretch, but it was the most successful aspect of the movie. The story is simple, and oftentimes can be dull, but the occasional insect song and dance routine, along with several apartment-sized battles between roach and human that stay consistently silly, it's easy to look past the tired love story. A wholly original, fun movie, anyone willing to let loose and laugh at some three stooges- esquire comedy will most likely enjoy the slapstick and excrement-related humor. Chances are that you can buy this movie for less than five dollars on DVD at this point, so if you happen to pass it, pick it up. What do you have to lose?

    I cannot begin to express my disdain and hatred for this film. I think I actually got dumber from having seen it... This is honestly one of THE worst films I have ever had the discomfort of sitting through. I made myself watch the entire thing because it wouldn't be right to put down a film I hadn't fully given a chance to. It was almost painful folks. It's disgusting, it's not funny, it's poorly acted, it's poorly written, it's beyond ridiculous and to make it even worse - they added musical numbers!!!!! I mean, how on earth could this film have gotten ANY worse? (oh right, see musical numbers) It is so wrong on pretty much every level and I, for one, am surprised Jerry O'Connell even shows his face in Hollywood after this disaster. (for crying out loud, Kangaroo Jack is 10 times better than this piece of refuse) Save your brain cells, skip this one. (and yes, it WAS "that bad"!)

    I've seen this many years ago when it just came out and now decided to watch it again. I remember it was pretty funny but then I was maybe 7 years old so now I was expecting this film to be stupid. I was surprised how clever this film was. The humor was sometimes stupid but in a good way. It also was kinda original humor sometimes. Jerry O'Connell played a naive new arrival to New York very well. It was so funny when I first saw his naive physiognomy just before he got robed. Jerry O'Connell is a really good comical actor. I also liked that Walter Sh!t character (played by Jim Turner), actually he was the reason why this comedy appeared original to me. It's also a half musical so there were few songs performed by Cockroaches, it was pretty clever made.

    When I read that someone had made a musical with singing & dancing cockroaches in a filthy apartment I was surprised. That the movie tanked didn't surprise me. I finally saw it and I loved it. Too funny. The musical scenes are great. Whoever planned them out knows a lot about musicals and what makes a song work on screen. The homage to "Footlight Parade" and the Esther Williams aqua spectaculars (aka the song in the toilet bowl) proves it. Great special effects. I wouldn't show it to small kids though-I did and they cried-the bugs freaked them out. Showed it again 6 years later to the same kids and they laughed and laughed. Very imaginative and the musical numbers are better than a lot of what has had some mainstream critics soiling themselves over in recent screen musicals.

    As someone who usually appreciates the absurd and likes many "black comedies," I was a little disappointed in this one. I mean, showing cockroaches who talk and sing sounded hilarious, so I rented the VHS shortly after it came out, but didn't find the dark humor as good as I had hoped. Somebody told me this film was really gross, but I didn't find that the case. It's not bad in that department. It just isn't as funny as you might hope. Also, let's be honest: how many people want to look at cockroaches for over an hour? How many want to see one for a minute? Not many. Cockroaches have to be one of the most disgusting creatures on earth. Yet having the guts to make a movie about them, and having them sing and dance, especially in a Busby Berkeley-type number, is pretty outrageous and deserves an "E for effort," as the saying used to go. I think this would have been more tolerable, and funny, had it been a short film, something around 20-30 minutes. It might even have won awards for "Best Short." but the "joke" begins to wear thin after awhile. Still, if you are looking for something TOTALLY different and you are hard to offend, look no further!

    I wonder why it got criticized because to me the worth of a movie is how you react to it. I first saw it on video in 1996 and I can tell you that we had to watch the intro three times because we were laughing so damn hard. Even the 'mother' of the house was constantly telling us to shooooshhhh because we laughed so loud. Never has a movie had me laughing so loud. Now 11 yrs later, my 5 yr and 6 yr old boys watch it and get a huge laugh out of it. They love to see the roaches singing and dancing.. So if anyone cans it, they can go to buggery because we all get a lot of laughs and entertainment out of it.

    Not just an old-fashioned music-and-dance extravaganza in the style of Busby Berkeley, "Joe's Apartment" is also a heartwarming tale of a naive midwestern boy learning about life, seeking his destiny in the big city. You'll find yourself cheering for Joe, as a tender romance is played out against the backdrop of an epic of modern life, when New York's poorest and most forgotten residents learn to overcome their distrust of an outsider, and help him to find both success and love. Based on the novel of the same name (winner of both the 1994 Pulitzer Prize and the 1995 Nobel prize for literature) and adapted for the screen through the combined efforts of Maya Angelou and Salman Rushdie, the power and majesty of the screenplay has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce acid reflux, and cure eczema ("Wisconsin Dermatological Review", November 1999.) Both a critical success and smash hit (by the end of 2007, the cumulative worldwide box office exceeded $830 million) the film has been playing continuously to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, London, Prague, and Rio de Janeiro for over eleven years. Its theme music was adopted in 2004 as the national anthem of Norway (this led to a brief but violent conflict with neighboring Finland, which had also sought to use the music for its anthem, until UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared before the General Assembly that "Joe's Apartment" should be considered "part of humanity's common cultural heritage.") Upon his return from a much-publicized audience with Pope John Paul II, star Jerry O'Connell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. The Dalai Lama (who at the time of this writing has seen the movie over 2300 times) was recently quoted in Newsweek as saying "No feeling person can see "Joe's Apartment" and not be moved to tears by its urgent message: that we must all embrace biological diversity in the fight against homelessness, crime, and political corruption." That this simple truth remains as relevant in today's society as when the film was made, is simply more proof of the prescience and timeless universality of the message. With its magnificent cinematography, lush musical score, and sensitive direction of the outstanding performances, it's easy to see why "Joe's Apartment" swept every major category in the 1997 Oscars, and is third on the AFI's list of the most ground-breaking films of all time. The artistry of this film recalls the heyday of Hollywood's past greatness, and will leave you both profoundly moved, and filled with renewed hope for the future of the world. "Joe's Apartment" is THE feel-good movie of the late '90s, a film that will warm the hearts of young and old, from your grandmother to your grandchildren. See it today, with someone you love.

    I went into Joe's Apartment I was expecting a crappy film, not going to lie. It was lampooned by critics, and is the first of it's kind as it's the first film by MTV. I saw bits and pieces of this flick when I was around eight years old with my dad, and thought it was a horror film. Thousands of cockroaches and their scratchy voices running around a ceiling kicking two guy's asses sounds like a Horror film. I was surprised to find out it was a comedy film by none other than MTV. After all, this was all when I was eight. Like I stated, I went into this expecting a horrible film. It looked like a cheesy MTV film that lacked talent and humor. I was totally wrong. This film is now on the list of favorite MTV films. I always complain in my other reviews that movies have lost creativity and idea in recent years, I think I got what I asked for. Singing cockroaches? Haven't seen that done before! Joe (O'Connell) is a College grad who is having a hard time after moving to New York City. He can't find a place or a job to manage. After posing as a recently dead elderly women's son, he is able to get her Apartment at very cheap. Little does he know the podunk joint is home to over 5,000 singing and talking cockroaches. Joe must now cope with the roaches irrational behavior, as well as trying to score big with a local, garden nut named Lily (Ward). But there isn't a huge market for women who dig jobless men who have a home infested with thousands of cockroaches last I checked. I could be wrong though. I have seen the original short that this film is based on, and I hate cockroaches. Though seeing cheesy beta versions of themselves somehow made me tolerate them for 80 minutes. Plus Jerry O'Connell's likable persona was something that flowed nicely throughout the film. Joe's Apartment crosses the line of disgusting and becomes utterly filled with gross out humor and repulsive scenery of Joe's apartment. But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment. Gives me an idea for my fourth short film. Starring: Jerry O'Connell, Megan Ward, Billy West, Robert Vaughn, Reginald Hudlin, Jim Turner, and Don Ho. Directed by: John Payson.

    I watched this movie a while back, and I have just Yesterday watched it again. For a movie made back then, I'm sort of impressed. The animations were pretty good, the acting was fine, the story was okay, but the humor was really good! I rate it so low because of the lack of stuff going on. Main character trying to fit into the new town. Normal story. Finds a girl, something bad happens, they soon meet up and everyone's happy. My favorite scenes were those with the animations and the interaction the actor had with them. Must be tough! And that constant swearing... goodness!

    This movie was a different one. But in every way possible was entertaining. I would give this a 6/10 at the least because it was a very different kind of story, but the acting for some characters could have been better, in my opinion. This is a great film for a more mature audiences simply because of its sexual humor and harsh language, which there is a lot of. But none the less, this was a fantastic movie, with a bunch of slap-stick humor, so anyone who loves this kind of humor should definitely watch. Also if your going to watch this film, be ready for some weird scenes and musical parts, because that is kind of what this movie is mostly put of. But overall, if your in the mood for a great slap-stick humor film, go watch Joe's Apartment.

    I absolutely detest roaches. Effing can't stand them, which is why the movie is a success. Making what I think to be one of the most disgusting creatures on Earth to be endearing, lovable characters was a huge stretch, but it was the most successful aspect of the movie. The story is simple, and oftentimes can be dull, but the occasional insect song and dance routine, along with several apartment-sized battles between roach and human that stay consistently silly, it's easy to look past the tired love story. A wholly original, fun movie, anyone willing to let loose and laugh at some three stooges- esquire comedy will most likely enjoy the slapstick and excrement-related humor. Chances are that you can buy this movie for less than five dollars on DVD at this point, so if you happen to pass it, pick it up. What do you have to lose?

    I cannot begin to express my disdain and hatred for this film. I think I actually got dumber from having seen it... This is honestly one of THE worst films I have ever had the discomfort of sitting through. I made myself watch the entire thing because it wouldn't be right to put down a film I hadn't fully given a chance to. It was almost painful folks. It's disgusting, it's not funny, it's poorly acted, it's poorly written, it's beyond ridiculous and to make it even worse - they added musical numbers!!!!! I mean, how on earth could this film have gotten ANY worse? (oh right, see musical numbers) It is so wrong on pretty much every level and I, for one, am surprised Jerry O'Connell even shows his face in Hollywood after this disaster. (for crying out loud, Kangaroo Jack is 10 times better than this piece of refuse) Save your brain cells, skip this one. (and yes, it WAS "that bad"!)

    I've seen this many years ago when it just came out and now decided to watch it again. I remember it was pretty funny but then I was maybe 7 years old so now I was expecting this film to be stupid. I was surprised how clever this film was. The humor was sometimes stupid but in a good way. It also was kinda original humor sometimes. Jerry O'Connell played a naive new arrival to New York very well. It was so funny when I first saw his naive physiognomy just before he got robed. Jerry O'Connell is a really good comical actor. I also liked that Walter Sh!t character (played by Jim Turner), actually he was the reason why this comedy appeared original to me. It's also a half musical so there were few songs performed by Cockroaches, it was pretty clever made.

    When I read that someone had made a musical with singing & dancing cockroaches in a filthy apartment I was surprised. That the movie tanked didn't surprise me. I finally saw it and I loved it. Too funny. The musical scenes are great. Whoever planned them out knows a lot about musicals and what makes a song work on screen. The homage to "Footlight Parade" and the Esther Williams aqua spectaculars (aka the song in the toilet bowl) proves it. Great special effects. I wouldn't show it to small kids though-I did and they cried-the bugs freaked them out. Showed it again 6 years later to the same kids and they laughed and laughed. Very imaginative and the musical numbers are better than a lot of what has had some mainstream critics soiling themselves over in recent screen musicals.

    As someone who usually appreciates the absurd and likes many "black comedies," I was a little disappointed in this one. I mean, showing cockroaches who talk and sing sounded hilarious, so I rented the VHS shortly after it came out, but didn't find the dark humor as good as I had hoped. Somebody told me this film was really gross, but I didn't find that the case. It's not bad in that department. It just isn't as funny as you might hope. Also, let's be honest: how many people want to look at cockroaches for over an hour? How many want to see one for a minute? Not many. Cockroaches have to be one of the most disgusting creatures on earth. Yet having the guts to make a movie about them, and having them sing and dance, especially in a Busby Berkeley-type number, is pretty outrageous and deserves an "E for effort," as the saying used to go. I think this would have been more tolerable, and funny, had it been a short film, something around 20-30 minutes. It might even have won awards for "Best Short." but the "joke" begins to wear thin after awhile. Still, if you are looking for something TOTALLY different and you are hard to offend, look no further!

    I wonder why it got criticized because to me the worth of a movie is how you react to it. I first saw it on video in 1996 and I can tell you that we had to watch the intro three times because we were laughing so damn hard. Even the 'mother' of the house was constantly telling us to shooooshhhh because we laughed so loud. Never has a movie had me laughing so loud. Now 11 yrs later, my 5 yr and 6 yr old boys watch it and get a huge laugh out of it. They love to see the roaches singing and dancing.. So if anyone cans it, they can go to buggery because we all get a lot of laughs and entertainment out of it.

    Not just an old-fashioned music-and-dance extravaganza in the style of Busby Berkeley, "Joe's Apartment" is also a heartwarming tale of a naive midwestern boy learning about life, seeking his destiny in the big city. You'll find yourself cheering for Joe, as a tender romance is played out against the backdrop of an epic of modern life, when New York's poorest and most forgotten residents learn to overcome their distrust of an outsider, and help him to find both success and love. Based on the novel of the same name (winner of both the 1994 Pulitzer Prize and the 1995 Nobel prize for literature) and adapted for the screen through the combined efforts of Maya Angelou and Salman Rushdie, the power and majesty of the screenplay has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce acid reflux, and cure eczema ("Wisconsin Dermatological Review", November 1999.) Both a critical success and smash hit (by the end of 2007, the cumulative worldwide box office exceeded $830 million) the film has been playing continuously to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, London, Prague, and Rio de Janeiro for over eleven years. Its theme music was adopted in 2004 as the national anthem of Norway (this led to a brief but violent conflict with neighboring Finland, which had also sought to use the music for its anthem, until UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared before the General Assembly that "Joe's Apartment" should be considered "part of humanity's common cultural heritage.") Upon his return from a much-publicized audience with Pope John Paul II, star Jerry O'Connell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. The Dalai Lama (who at the time of this writing has seen the movie over 2300 times) was recently quoted in Newsweek as saying "No feeling person can see "Joe's Apartment" and not be moved to tears by its urgent message: that we must all embrace biological diversity in the fight against homelessness, crime, and political corruption." That this simple truth remains as relevant in today's society as when the film was made, is simply more proof of the prescience and timeless universality of the message. With its magnificent cinematography, lush musical score, and sensitive direction of the outstanding performances, it's easy to see why "Joe's Apartment" swept every major category in the 1997 Oscars, and is third on the AFI's list of the most ground-breaking films of all time. The artistry of this film recalls the heyday of Hollywood's past greatness, and will leave you both profoundly moved, and filled with renewed hope for the future of the world. "Joe's Apartment" is THE feel-good movie of the late '90s, a film that will warm the hearts of young and old, from your grandmother to your grandchildren. See it today, with someone you love.

But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment. Gives me an idea for my fourth short film. Starring: Jerry O'Connell, Megan Ward, Billy West, Robert Vaughn, Reginald Hudlin, Jim Turner, and Don Ho. Directed by: John Payson.

    I watched this movie a while back, and I have just Yesterday watched it again. For a movie made back then, I'm sort of impressed. The animations were pretty good, the acting was fine, the story was okay, but the humor was really good! I rate it so low because of the lack of stuff going on. Main character trying to fit into the new town. Normal story. Finds a girl, something bad happens, they soon meet up and everyone's happy. My favorite scenes were those with the animations and the interaction the actor had with them. Must be tough! And that constant swearing... goodness!

    This movie was a different one. But in every way possible was entertaining. I would give this a 6/10 at the least because it was a very different kind of story, but the acting for some characters could have been better, in my opinion. This is a great film for a more mature audiences simply because of its sexual humor and harsh language, which there is a lot of. But none the less, this was a fantastic movie, with a bunch of slap-stick humor, so anyone who loves this kind of humor should definitely watch. Also if your going to watch this film, be ready for some weird scenes and musical parts, because that is kind of what this movie is mostly put of. But overall, if your in the mood for a great slap-stick humor film, go watch Joe's Apartment.

    I absolutely detest roaches. Effing can't stand them, which is why the movie is a success. Making what I think to be one of the most disgusting creatures on Earth to be endearing, lovable characters was a huge stretch, but it was the most successful aspect of the movie. The story is simple, and oftentimes can be dull, but the occasional insect song and dance routine, along with several apartment-sized battles between roach and human that stay consistently silly, it's easy to look past the tired love story. A wholly original, fun movie, anyone willing to let loose and laugh at some three stooges- esquire comedy will most likely enjoy the slapstick and excrement-related humor. Chances are that you can buy this movie for less than five dollars on DVD at this point, so if you happen to pass it, pick it up. What do you have to lose?

    I cannot begin to express my disdain and hatred for this film. I think I actually got dumber from having seen it... This is honestly one of THE worst films I have ever had the discomfort of sitting through. I made myself watch the entire thing because it wouldn't be right to put down a film I hadn't fully given a chance to. It was almost painful folks. It's disgusting, it's not funny, it's poorly acted, it's poorly written, it's beyond ridiculous and to make it even worse - they added musical numbers!!!!! I mean, how on earth could this film have gotten ANY worse? (oh right, see musical numbers) It is so wrong on pretty much every level and I, for one, am surprised Jerry O'Connell even shows his face in Hollywood after this disaster. (for crying out loud, Kangaroo Jack is 10 times better than this piece of refuse) Save your brain cells, skip this one. (and yes, it WAS "that bad"!)

    I've seen this many years ago when it just came out and now decided to watch it again. I remember it was pretty funny but then I was maybe 7 years old so now I was expecting this film to be stupid. I was surprised how clever this film was. The humor was sometimes stupid but in a good way. It also was kinda original humor sometimes. Jerry O'Connell played a naive new arrival to New York very well. It was so funny when I first saw his naive physiognomy just before he got robed. Jerry O'Connell is a really good comical actor. I also liked that Walter Sh!t character (played by Jim Turner), actually he was the reason why this comedy appeared original to me. It's also a half musical so there were few songs performed by Cockroaches, it was pretty clever made.

    When I read that someone had made a musical with singing & dancing cockroaches in a filthy apartment I was surprised. That the movie tanked didn't surprise me. I finally saw it and I loved it. Too funny. The musical scenes are great. Whoever planned them out knows a lot about musicals and what makes a song work on screen. The homage to "Footlight Parade" and the Esther Williams aqua spectaculars (aka the song in the toilet bowl) proves it. Great special effects. I wouldn't show it to small kids though-I did and they cried-the bugs freaked them out. Showed it again 6 years later to the same kids and they laughed and laughed. Very imaginative and the musical numbers are better than a lot of what has had some mainstream critics soiling themselves over in recent screen musicals.

    As someone who usually appreciates the absurd and likes many "black comedies," I was a little disappointed in this one. I mean, showing cockroaches who talk and sing sounded hilarious, so I rented the VHS shortly after it came out, but didn't find the dark humor as good as I had hoped. Somebody told me this film was really gross, but I didn't find that the case. It's not bad in that department. It just isn't as funny as you might hope. Also, let's be honest: how many people want to look at cockroaches for over an hour? How many want to see one for a minute? Not many. Cockroaches have to be one of the most disgusting creatures on earth. Yet having the guts to make a movie about them, and having them sing and dance, especially in a Busby Berkeley-type number, is pretty outrageous and deserves an "E for effort," as the saying used to go. I think this would have been more tolerable, and funny, had it been a short film, something around 20-30 minutes. It might even have won awards for "Best Short." but the "joke" begins to wear thin after awhile. Still, if you are looking for something TOTALLY different and you are hard to offend, look no further!

    I wonder why it got criticized because to me the worth of a movie is how you react to it. I first saw it on video in 1996 and I can tell you that we had to watch the intro three times because we were laughing so damn hard. Even the 'mother' of the house was constantly telling us to shooooshhhh because we laughed so loud. Never has a movie had me laughing so loud. Now 11 yrs later, my 5 yr and 6 yr old boys watch it and get a huge laugh out of it. They love to see the roaches singing and dancing.. So if anyone cans it, they can go to buggery because we all get a lot of laughs and entertainment out of it.

    Not just an old-fashioned music-and-dance extravaganza in the style of Busby Berkeley, "Joe's Apartment" is also a heartwarming tale of a naive midwestern boy learning about life, seeking his destiny in the big city. You'll find yourself cheering for Joe, as a tender romance is played out against the backdrop of an epic of modern life, when New York's poorest and most forgotten residents learn to overcome their distrust of an outsider, and help him to find both success and love. Based on the novel of the same name (winner of both the 1994 Pulitzer Prize and the 1995 Nobel prize for literature) and adapted for the screen through the combined efforts of Maya Angelou and Salman Rushdie, the power and majesty of the screenplay has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce acid reflux, and cure eczema ("Wisconsin Dermatological Review", November 1999.) Both a critical success and smash hit (by the end of 2007, the cumulative worldwide box office exceeded $830 million) the film has been playing continuously to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, London, Prague, and Rio de Janeiro for over eleven years. Its theme music was adopted in 2004 as the national anthem of Norway (this led to a brief but violent conflict with neighboring Finland, which had also sought to use the music for its anthem, until UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared before the General Assembly that "Joe's Apartment" should be considered "part of humanity's common cultural heritage.") Upon his return from a much-publicized audience with Pope John Paul II, star Jerry O'Connell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. The Dalai Lama (who at the time of this writing has seen the movie over 2300 times) was recently quoted in Newsweek as saying "No feeling person can see "Joe's Apartment" and not be moved to tears by its urgent message: that we must all embrace biological diversity in the fight against homelessness, crime, and political corruption." That this simple truth remains as relevant in today's society as when the film was made, is simply more proof of the prescience and timeless universality of the message. With its magnificent cinematography, lush musical score, and sensitive direction of the outstanding performances, it's easy to see why "Joe's Apartment" swept every major category in the 1997 Oscars, and is third on the AFI's list of the most ground-breaking films of all time. The artistry of this film recalls the heyday of Hollywood's past greatness, and will leave you both profoundly moved, and filled with renewed hope for the future of the world. "Joe's Apartment" is THE feel-good movie of the late '90s, a film that will warm the hearts of young and old, from your grandmother to your grandchildren. See it today, with someone you love.

    I went into Joe's Apartment I was expecting a crappy film, not going to lie. It was lampooned by critics, and is the first of it's kind as it's the first film by MTV. I saw bits and pieces of this flick when I was around eight years old with my dad, and thought it was a horror film. Thousands of cockroaches and their scratchy voices running around a ceiling kicking two guy's asses sounds like a Horror film. I was surprised to find out it was a comedy film by none other than MTV. After all, this was all when I was eight. Like I stated, I went into this expecting a horrible film. It looked like a cheesy MTV film that lacked talent and humor. I was totally wrong. This film is now on the list of favorite MTV films. I always complain in my other reviews that movies have lost creativity and idea in recent years, I think I got what I asked for. Singing cockroaches? Haven't seen that done before! Joe (O'Connell) is a College grad who is having a hard time after moving to New York City. He can't find a place or a job to manage. After posing as a recently dead elderly women's son, he is able to get her Apartment at very cheap. Little does he know the podunk joint is home to over 5,000 singing and talking cockroaches. Joe must now cope with the roaches irrational behavior, as well as trying to score big with a local, garden nut named Lily (Ward). But there isn't a huge market for women who dig jobless men who have a home infested with thousands of cockroaches last I checked. I could be wrong though. I have seen the original short that this film is based on, and I hate cockroaches. Though seeing cheesy beta versions of themselves somehow made me tolerate them for 80 minutes. Plus Jerry O'Connell's likable persona was something that flowed nicely throughout the film. Joe's Apartment crosses the line of disgusting and becomes utterly filled with gross out humor and repulsive scenery of Joe's apartment. But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment.
