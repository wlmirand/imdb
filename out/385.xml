    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail.

Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film?

(Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis.

The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.

    "Sorry." "Sorry, sorry!" "SORRY!" says agent Harry Tasker. Repeatedly. Is it about lying in True Lies? No, about all the destruction he causes and knowing the true Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'm sure he improvised that into the film. Aside from that and the meandering in between multiple and unnecessary subplots, I truly liked this film. It helped it was, unbeknownst to us all, the second to last great Schwarzenegger-helmed projects for a long time (1996's Eraser is the last great one, until 2013's fun The Last Stand premiered.) Also, aiding in this film's success was the unapologetic R-Rating  I miss those movies and the fantastic and often hilarious performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. (Okay, you can include the mostly funny Tom Arnold.) Further, this was when Director James Cameron was having fun and making a quality living. (Later, he would get sucked into the clich&eacute;d-heavy world of Avatar and sadly, not look back.) Finally, I love the gorgeous Tia Carrere and was saddened that she rarely starred in anything big beyond this and the Wayne's World films. 'Double lives' movies weren't even new back in 1994, but thanks to the all-around performances and direction, True Lies made it feel fresh, and fun. In a thin, though normal-for-the-90s-action genre, plot, Schwarzenegger's Harry has a nice home life with a wife, Curtis's Helen and a boring  to her, albeit fake, job. Truly, he's a spy and is trying to thwart a terrorist attack in Florida. And no, it's not to end the fantastic Golden Girls TV series  that ended in 1992. But, since this movie was likely filmed in 1993, perhaps it was to end the terrible Golden Palace spin off that happened that year. That leads to this, this to that and Helen gets caught up in Harry's lies and despite the movie being fun (and funny) up to that point, the sh|t hits the fan and it gets even better with Curtis's role expanded in the last half. Now, you seriously cannot take this movie seriously, and like most 1990s action, this movie has more plot holes than Arnold had mistresses. And, I can forgive most of them. What I couldn't was the length and the over-the-top cartoon finale. (SEE: jet skiing in the air.) The movie was far too long (141 minutes!) and when we do get to that unintentionally laugh-out-loud climax, you'll agree that, despite how much fun the audience had up to that point, it should've been edited down a bit. Oh, wait, it's Cameron we're dealing with here. Never mind. He doesn't cut anything  he only produces gold, or so he'll tell you. Overall, despite a few drawbacks I had with the film  "Sorry!", overall, it's a fun ride and one of the best Schwarzenegger films in his collection. Side Note: As mentioned, for a period of almost 20 years, this was Schwarzenegger's second to last fantastic movie. The same goes for Cameron. His follow-up to this was the masterpiece Titanic. Sadly, aside from some water-related diving films, and the ho-hum of Avatar, he hasn't come back as Schwarzenegger has. I'm still waiting to see a great Cameron-directed film like beforeTitanic, True Lies, Terminator 1-2, The Abyss, Aliensanyone, anyone? Nowe get, the blah Avatar, and he wants to spend his remaining days on Earth doingthree sequels to those. Seriously? Come on.

    73/100: B (Great Movie) Before watching this I have to admit I did not expect it to be funny, instead I was looking for action because you know, Arnold is in it. Luckily I was able to get both as it was not at all what I expected. Harry (Arnold) is a secret agent who discovers that his wife may be having an affair. After using all of resources necessary he spies on his wife and some man claiming to also be a secret agent. What Harry does to both of the them in the future is funny and action packed. And not bad to watch. There were, however a few things that bothered me in the film. First off, Jamie Lee Curtis is not an actress I would say is enjoyable to watch and made the movie worse in my opinion. Arnold, of course, did a good job in his natural role as tough guy who can pretty much kill anything. As for overall about the movie it is definitely watchable and enjoyable too.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger plays secret agent Harry Trasker, who tries to keep his profession secret from his wife Helen(played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Harry doesn't realize how bored Helen has become, and is shocked when she contemplates having an affair with a sleazy used car dealer(played by Bill Paxton). Harry and his partner Albert(Tom Arnold) then concoct an elaborate plan to determine if Helen has cheated or not, but this plan is interrupted when Muslim terrorists plan to attack America with a nuclear warhead, so Helen instead ends up aiding Harry in this desperate mission to save the country. Good cast, and energetic direction by James Cameron compensate for rambling nature of the film, which spends too much time with its "Is Helen cheating" subplot. Still, the action scenes deliver the goods, and (now old-fashioned!) action/adventure film is quite entertaining(if not that credible) Charlton Heston has a good cameo role as Harry's tough boss.

    I only give this movie 2 stars because it is NOT available in an anamorphic format. (It is NOT "enhanced for widescreen TV"). The video quality is very poor. This movie and "The Abyss" ( both James Cameron films) need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu Ray) and on Blu Ray. It is my understanding that James Cameron must personally authorize a transfer to anamorphic DVD and a transfer to Blu Ray. I will not purchase either of these titles until they are available on Blu Ray. James Cameron needs to quit screwing around with his submarine and his other underwater adventures and get on the stick to get these two movies released in a proper format. He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases alone to finance more of his adventures!

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film.

If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix.

    I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me pretty cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that. Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst. Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it. The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that. I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way. There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this. Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise disappointing movie.

    True Lies is a great movie with a very exciting and energetic storyline and fantastic performances from both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis,she actually won a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie,with she deserved,she did a very impressive performance and she was also surprisingly very attractive.The movie is a typical one for Arnold Schwarzenegger,its not his best but its also not his worst,it is a character you would expect him to play but he does a very good job of it.Fans of both action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies will get a good kick out of True Lies. Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger),a secret agent who has hidden his job from his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) for fifteen years,must confess his secret while dealing with terrorists and suspecting his wife may be having an affair.

    It is a shame. All the Action and fun stuff is here trying and mostly succeeding in topping that what had gone before, but the sub-plot, actually another plot, of the frustrated Wife is mishandled. The rather raunchy, sleazy humor seems out of place here and at times Viewers may feel embarrassed, at the very least for the Performers. Some of the dirty lines and situations belong in another Movie and mix uneasily. What works best is the blistering Action Scenes. The attempted humor, excluding some cringe-inducing filthy sexual innuendos, can fit into this. Arnie's sidekick mostly supplies the punch lines and His Wife supplies most of the punches. So this is a mixed bag of enjoyment. If you can ignore the middle section with some really clunky stuff, and tolerate Bill Paxton's obnoxious, over the top Character, this can be Thrilling. in all, the Good outweighs the Bad. The Good is really Good, but the Bad is really Bad. The Hotel Scene, the Interrogation Scene, and the Trailer Scene almost ruin the Movie, but don't because there is so much of the incredible. The Chases and the Armaments, the Action and Violence, make this worth a watch.

    The 90s were great time for big action films, with films like Terminator 2, the Bond films, The Rock, Con Air, the Die Hard films and many more being released. One of them was comedy-action-thriller True Lies, a loose remake of a French film helmed by the great James Cameron and led by his Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is an American spy (despite having a thick Austrian accent) for a black ops agency investigating a terrorist organisation called Crimson Jihad with his team, Gib (Tom Arnold) and Faisal (Grant Heslov). Crimson Jihad, led by Aziz (Art Malik) is spectated of buying four Soviet nuclear weapons and plan to use them against the United States. But even worst for Harry is that finds out his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) might be having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Bill Paxton) who is pretending to be a spy. When I was younger I disliked True Lies, seeing it as an American attempt to make a Bond film. My opinion has soften and I see it for what is, a fun action-comedy. Its winning features are its action sequences and its quick pacing. It is never a dull film and Cameron is of course one of the best action directors around. There are plenty of fight scenes, shoots outs and chases. True Lies uses a combination of partial effects and excellent CGI for the time. The action is memorial, particular the first action sequence, the bathroom fight and chase in Washington D.C., the battle on the island and the highway chase. The Cameron was to make the action over the top, adding to the lighter, comic tone. Whilst True Lies works very well as an action film, the comedy is much weaker elements. There are some funs little jokes, but Cameron is naturally a more serious director. The worst offender of the humour comes from Tom Arnold who is not a funny comedian and his character came off as obnoxious more then the likable comic relief. At least Schwarzenegger has some one-liners and has the action chops, but of course he is not renounced for being the best actor. The other major problem is the detour the film takes when Harry stops his investigation into Crimson Jihad and follows his wife when he thinks she is having an affair. It was not funny and it led to a cruel, sadistic and creepy subplot as Harry uses a lot of government resources to follow his wife. It stops the film dead. The subplot should have been played different, from Harry trying to keep his secret identity from family or Helen finding Harry's identity by accident. Plot wise True Lies has a perfectly fine plot for a spy action-thriller for the time. Of course we have much more understanding of Islamic terrorism then pop culture did back in 1994. The plot was actually so similar to the plot the Bond series was going to use that they had to change it: but of it worked out for the best because we got a fun film with Arnie and one of the best Bond films with Goldeneye. Whilst I did compare True Lies to Bond there is enough differences to make True Lies its own film. There are some homages/parodies such the use of a gadget and Harry going to high society event (with the beginning being a clear reference to Goldfinger). If you enjoy the Mission Impossible films you should find enjoyment from True Lies. True Lies is a fun experience and is a fine addition to the high octane 90s action. Cameron and Schwarzenegger have better films in their filmography but True Lies is still good comfort viewing if you fancy an action fix. I would have liked to have seen a sequel made but sadly that is not going to happen now.

    Arnie and James Cameron team up again for a deliberately over-the-top, often amusing spy adventure, a homage to Bond, and perhaps Scarecrow and Mrs King too - it was based on a French short, La Total. It opens up with a neat homage to Goldfinger as secret agent Harry Tasker - Arnie - sneaks his way into the swimming pool of a mansion in Switzerland, and when he emerges, takes off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculately pressed dinner jacket underneath. As the mission goes sour when accosted by a guard upon leaving, we get the first epic action setpiece, a sign of what to come. When it's back to the States, we learn Harry has a wife - Jamie Lee Curtis - and daughter - Eliza Dushku. While Harry is concentrating on catching terrorists who may have in their possession a nuclear weapon, he's only beginning to realise his family life is falling apart, with his wife being courted by a sleazy used car salesman pretending to be a spy in trouble - Simon played to perfection by Bill Paxton, another Cameron regular. This mid-section may put off those who just want to watch things blow up, but stick with it. Just as an attempt to fix his marriage is about to backfire horribly, Harry suddenly finds himself kidnapped by the terrorists he's pursuing, and now his wife is involved. At this point, patient viewers are rewarded as the film proceeds to deliver breakneck action, from Harry's escape, his rescue of his wife, and his battle with the terrorists while flying a commandeered Harrier jumpjet. A little less taut than it should have been, but an action fan's delight.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, Tom Arnold, Tia Carrere, Art Malik, Eliza Dushku and Charlton Heston star in James Cameron's 1994 action film. This is the story of Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) who has a wife, Helen (Curtis) and teenage daughter, Dana (Dushku). He has one problem, he's been leading a double life as a secret government agent which they don't know about. Arnold plays his friend and partner, Albert Gibson, Heston plays their boss, Spencer Trilby, Malik (The Living Daylights) plays Arab Terrorist, Salim Aziz and Carrere plays his assistant, Juno Skinner. Helen eventually discovers the truth about Harry after she gets mixed up with sleazy car salesman, Simon (Paxton) and shares the action experiences with him. This is a good action flick with some funny moments and Schwarzenegger and Curtis are great together. I recommend this.
