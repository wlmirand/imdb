    Based on Robert Marasco's novel, film tells the story of young family Ben, Marian, and Davey(Oliver Reed, Karen Black, Lee Montgomery) who, along with his aunt(Bette Davis) rent a country house from July 1 until Labor Day for the small sum of $900 Dollars. They can't believe their good luck, until increasingly strange, then sinister occurrences convince them that the house is haunted, and out to get them... Though atmospheric and at times eerie, this thriller is too slow moving, since it has several redundant sequences. Famous ending may come as a surprise, but also veers too close to being melodramatic and unintentionally funny. Watchable enough way to spend nearly two hours, but director Dan Curtis had done better, though film almost works...but not quite!

    The Chauffeur alone would have made this one of the creepiest horror films ever made. I literally went into tears because of his dark character. The cast couldn't have been better. To have Betty Davis, Karen Black, and Oliver Reed in your picture... the director had to know he would end up with a classic. The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention, the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor, watch Burnt Offerings.

    If you are looking for blood, gore, or loud jump scares, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather than resorting to cheap tactics, this film focuses heavily on atmosphere, suspense, and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film, that the first time I watched it, I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your run-of-the-mill haunted house film when you simply read the summary, but when you actually watch the film, it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated, chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that, they are both wonderful. It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies, but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly, that was not meant to happen. Overall, this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.

    The 1970's were a great time for horror . This offering (no pun intended ) more than holds its own among many of the other classics from the same period . This haunted house story is very similar to both The Shining and The Amityville Horror and I might add Burnt Offerings predates both of those films . Great direction, cast and score. The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent ,as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film , it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way . The only horror movie of this type that I feel is better than this is The Shining , but not by much. Very recommended for fans of classy, well made horror.

    Haunted house chiller from Dan Curtis has Oliver Reed and Karen Black as summer caretakers moving into Gothic house with their young son... Some have said this is Dan Curtis' best film. I simply cannot agree with that, being such a fan of his work overall. I will say this one is a winner, though, with great genre actors Oliver Reed and Karen Black, an elderly Bette Davis and even Burgess Meredith. Quite the cast! The pace is a bit slower, and it may strike some people as boring if they are not prepared for a slow film. Through much of the movie, very little happens. And sometimes when it does happen, it becomes even more confusing (why people are sometimes under a spell and sometimes not is unclear). Did this film inspire "Evil Dead"? I would not say it is obvious, but the use of vines suggested this conclusion to me, as well as the fallen tree keeping the family from leaving the house... there is definitely that element of a cursed house with control over the surrounding woods. I find it interesting that this was the first film to feature the Dunsmuir Mansion in Oakland, and it has since appeared in "Phantasm" (1979), "Partners in Crime" (1984), "A View to a Kill" (1985), "The Vineyard" (1989), "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (1993), "Gloria" (1999) and "True Crime" (1999). If i ever make it out to Oakland, this is a place I need to visit for sure.

    I've always had a soft spot for Bette Davis (who could not?), but with her appearance in Burnt Offerings, she has become my old-lady idol. Screw wrinkles, she puts on her eyeliner anyway, and of course, it's liquid eyeliner. Red or orange lips and a black cigarette always in her hands, punctuating her bitter sarcasm. I adore her, with her little pooch stomach hanging out but stylish in bold floral prints, the height of seventies fashion. Karen Black is also strong as the loving wife who twists domesticity into horror. The ladies dominate this little movie with the one adult male figure (Oliver Reed as Black's husband) reduced to an infantile state, even further regressed than his son at one point when the wicked home and hearth has had its way with him. The ending was a surprise to me, not because of where the story leadsany horror fan could see that one comingbut because the young son is allowed to see his father cartwheel from the top of the house and is then covered with his father's blood when he splats on the family station wagon. That just doesn't happen any longer in Hollywood. Children are comforted and cosseted with happy endings, reassured that nothing traumatic can't be undone. Foreign filmmakers are more daring when dealing with children. I'm thinking of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage by Juan Antonio Bayona. I do remember critics saying that Pan's Labyrinth could never be made in today's Hollywood because of the traumatic ending that happens to a child.

    Slasher, gore & over-the-top, special effects fans, will most likely, not enjoy this old school, horror movie. I first saw this one in the theaters, during my high school days... It's always remained a favorite, mostly because of it's excellent, quirky cast & creepy details. As one viewer noted, the original novel was a direct influence on The Shinning. The cast includes, Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Betty Davis, Burgess Meredith, Eileen Heckart, Dub Taylor & the unforgettable, Anthony James. It's weaknesses lie mainly in the script & editing. I'm being picky, but if there's one weak link in the cast, it's Oliver Reed. In terms of a remake, in the right hands, Burnt Offerings could be an absolute classic! Dan Curtis directs...Known for TV's Dark Shadows & two, made for TV flicks, starring the excellent, Darren McGavin, as news reporter, Kolchak, in both 1973's, The Night Stalker & The Night Strangler. He also directed a couple of my personal favorite, made for TV, horror movies, starring the great, Jack Palance; 1968's, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde & 1974's, Dracula.

    By the 1970s, subtlety in Horror wasn't seen nearly as much. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, visceral thrills can be very effective in their own right. On the other, some times suspense and tension were sacrificed. There are however a few examples of the genre from this time that harken back to the old days. 'The Haunting' is a perfect example that showing very little can work. Based on the novel of the same name, 'Burnt Offerings' is more of an old fashioned ghost story. It's not a classic exactly, but has quite a bit going for it. Pros: Strong cast and performances. Eerie score. Great setting that's both beautiful and spooky. Neat concept. Moves at a steady pace most of the time. Nice job on the cinematography. A few good chills. Memorable ending. Cons: Occasionally plodding. Can be predictable. Looks more like a made for TV movie. Some plot holes. Could have used a little more oomph. Final thoughts: One could find much better films of this type. That being said, you could also find ones totally forgettable. If slow-paced, mostly suggestive from back in the day is your cup of tea, then give it a whirl. There are just enough goodies to make it worth the the 115 minutes. My rating: 3/5

    I was 12 when Burnt Offerings came out but I do remember it was the subject of a lot of jeering, both in the press and by my peers. I just watched it, 35 years later, on Netflix streaming and was both impressed and amused. Impressed, because, although the story is clunky, it's not without creepy, memorable moments. It couldn't be better cast, for one. Karen Black, who always had a vaguely campy and alien-like quality with her crossed eyes and inflated lips, and Oliver Reed, who can't ever play a part without exuding some primordial menace and anger (think "Tommy" and "Women In Love") are both perfect as the unsuspecting couple who rent the imposing Alardyce estate for a few months in summer, taking along their wise- cracking bawdy aunt Elizabeth (a treat to see Bette Davis in almost anything). Even Burgess Meridith, Elieen Heckert, and Dub Taylor add considerable gravitas to the affair in their brief cameos at the start of the flick. The film has another huge asset to help hide the workman-like direction of Dan Curtis...the house. It really is an excellent, classic piece of horror design, and the fact that it's real just adds to the mystique. The main problem I have is with its stale '70s-ness. The TV movie-esqe score only needs a Theramin wailing to be even more corny, the scene with Oliver Reed roughing up his son while possessed is terrifying as played by the always manic actor, but is it not apparent that he's manhandling a DUMMY half the time? Simiilarly, the fake brick chimney collapsing at the end, capped with the ridiculously stupid screaming freeze frame of Lee Montgomery is almost worth a chuckle. And another thing...Montgomery's acting. Wow, all I can say is child actors have come a long way since the only criteria was to "look cute." Don't get me wrong...Burnt Offerings is still worth your time. It has so many elements going for it. If only they could have found a director who knew exactly how to serve up aged cheese...like maybe Brian DePalma ala "Sisters."

    I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it only got worse not the actors or anything like that its the long drawn out story and the deaths no real woman would risk her family like that. I was totally dissatisfied with the movie and the two hours I wasted watching it. The actors in the main part of the movie Are great totally drew me in. But just didn't enjoy it. I am sorry but I just don't like it. This review thing makes you use so many lines and I can't think of anything else to say. The restoration of the house after each incident was clearly attached to the deaths or violence. And the wife's transformation including the change of the way she dressed the grey that quickly appeared in her hair and her attitude was so clearly attached to house _ It was ridiculous. Like I said I waited for it to get better but it was not in the cards

    I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it only got worse not the actors or anything like that its the long drawn out story and the deaths no real woman would risk her family like that. I was totally dissatisfied with the movie and the two hours I wasted watching it. The actors in the main part of the movie Are great totally drew me in. But just didn't enjoy it. I am sorry but I just don't like it. This review thing makes you use so many lines and I can't think of anything else to say. The restoration of the house after each incident was clearly attached to the deaths or violence. And the wife's transformation including the change of the way she dressed the grey that quickly appeared in her hair and her attitude was so clearly attached to house _ It was ridiculous. Like I said I waited for it to get better but it was not in the cards

    Based on Robert Marasco's novel, film tells the story of young family Ben, Marian, and Davey(Oliver Reed, Karen Black, Lee Montgomery) who, along with his aunt(Bette Davis) rent a country house from July 1 until Labor Day for the small sum of $900 Dollars. They can't believe their good luck, until increasingly strange, then sinister occurrences convince them that the house is haunted, and out to get them... Though atmospheric and at times eerie, this thriller is too slow moving, since it has several redundant sequences. Famous ending may come as a surprise, but also veers too close to being melodramatic and unintentionally funny. Watchable enough way to spend nearly two hours, but director Dan Curtis had done better, though film almost works...but not quite!

    The Chauffeur alone would have made this one of the creepiest horror films ever made. I literally went into tears because of his dark character. The cast couldn't have been better. To have Betty Davis, Karen Black, and Oliver Reed in your picture... the director had to know he would end up with a classic. The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention, the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor, watch Burnt Offerings.

    If you are looking for blood, gore, or loud jump scares, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather than resorting to cheap tactics, this film focuses heavily on atmosphere, suspense, and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film, that the first time I watched it, I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your run-of-the-mill haunted house film when you simply read the summary, but when you actually watch the film, it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated, chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that, they are both wonderful. It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies, but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly, that was not meant to happen. Overall, this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.

    The 1970's were a great time for horror . This offering (no pun intended ) more than holds its own among many of the other classics from the same period . This haunted house story is very similar to both The Shining and The Amityville Horror and I might add Burnt Offerings predates both of those films . Great direction, cast and score. The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent ,as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film , it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way . The only horror movie of this type that I feel is better than this is The Shining , but not by much. Very recommended for fans of classy, well made horror.

    Haunted house chiller from Dan Curtis has Oliver Reed and Karen Black as summer caretakers moving into Gothic house with their young son... Some have said this is Dan Curtis' best film. I simply cannot agree with that, being such a fan of his work overall. I will say this one is a winner, though, with great genre actors Oliver Reed and Karen Black, an elderly Bette Davis and even Burgess Meredith. Quite the cast! The pace is a bit slower, and it may strike some people as boring if they are not prepared for a slow film. Through much of the movie, very little happens. And sometimes when it does happen, it becomes even more confusing (why people are sometimes under a spell and sometimes not is unclear). Did this film inspire "Evil Dead"? I would not say it is obvious, but the use of vines suggested this conclusion to me, as well as the fallen tree keeping the family from leaving the house... there is definitely that element of a cursed house with control over the surrounding woods. I find it interesting that this was the first film to feature the Dunsmuir Mansion in Oakland, and it has since appeared in "Phantasm" (1979), "Partners in Crime" (1984), "A View to a Kill" (1985), "The Vineyard" (1989), "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (1993), "Gloria" (1999) and "True Crime" (1999). If i ever make it out to Oakland, this is a place I need to visit for sure.

    I've always had a soft spot for Bette Davis (who could not?), but with her appearance in Burnt Offerings, she has become my old-lady idol. Screw wrinkles, she puts on her eyeliner anyway, and of course, it's liquid eyeliner. Red or orange lips and a black cigarette always in her hands, punctuating her bitter sarcasm. I adore her, with her little pooch stomach hanging out but stylish in bold floral prints, the height of seventies fashion. Karen Black is also strong as the loving wife who twists domesticity into horror. The ladies dominate this little movie with the one adult male figure (Oliver Reed as Black's husband) reduced to an infantile state, even further regressed than his son at one point when the wicked home and hearth has had its way with him. The ending was a surprise to me, not because of where the story leadsany horror fan could see that one comingbut because the young son is allowed to see his father cartwheel from the top of the house and is then covered with his father's blood when he splats on the family station wagon. That just doesn't happen any longer in Hollywood. Children are comforted and cosseted with happy endings, reassured that nothing traumatic can't be undone. Foreign filmmakers are more daring when dealing with children. I'm thinking of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage by Juan Antonio Bayona. I do remember critics saying that Pan's Labyrinth could never be made in today's Hollywood because of the traumatic ending that happens to a child.

    Slasher, gore & over-the-top, special effects fans, will most likely, not enjoy this old school, horror movie. I first saw this one in the theaters, during my high school days... It's always remained a favorite, mostly because of it's excellent, quirky cast & creepy details. As one viewer noted, the original novel was a direct influence on The Shinning. The cast includes, Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Betty Davis, Burgess Meredith, Eileen Heckart, Dub Taylor & the unforgettable, Anthony James. It's weaknesses lie mainly in the script & editing. I'm being picky, but if there's one weak link in the cast, it's Oliver Reed. In terms of a remake, in the right hands, Burnt Offerings could be an absolute classic! Dan Curtis directs...Known for TV's Dark Shadows & two, made for TV flicks, starring the excellent, Darren McGavin, as news reporter, Kolchak, in both 1973's, The Night Stalker & The Night Strangler. He also directed a couple of my personal favorite, made for TV, horror movies, starring the great, Jack Palance; 1968's, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde & 1974's, Dracula.

    By the 1970s, subtlety in Horror wasn't seen nearly as much. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, visceral thrills can be very effective in their own right. On the other, some times suspense and tension were sacrificed. There are however a few examples of the genre from this time that harken back to the old days. 'The Haunting' is a perfect example that showing very little can work. Based on the novel of the same name, 'Burnt Offerings' is more of an old fashioned ghost story. It's not a classic exactly, but has quite a bit going for it. Pros: Strong cast and performances. Eerie score. Great setting that's both beautiful and spooky. Neat concept. Moves at a steady pace most of the time. Nice job on the cinematography. A few good chills. Memorable ending. Cons: Occasionally plodding. Can be predictable. Looks more like a made for TV movie. Some plot holes. Could have used a little more oomph. Final thoughts: One could find much better films of this type. That being said, you could also find ones totally forgettable. If slow-paced, mostly suggestive from back in the day is your cup of tea, then give it a whirl. There are just enough goodies to make it worth the the 115 minutes. My rating: 3/5

    I was 12 when Burnt Offerings came out but I do remember it was the subject of a lot of jeering, both in the press and by my peers. I just watched it, 35 years later, on Netflix streaming and was both impressed and amused. Impressed, because, although the story is clunky, it's not without creepy, memorable moments. It couldn't be better cast, for one. Karen Black, who always had a vaguely campy and alien-like quality with her crossed eyes and inflated lips, and Oliver Reed, who can't ever play a part without exuding some primordial menace and anger (think "Tommy" and "Women In Love") are both perfect as the unsuspecting couple who rent the imposing Alardyce estate for a few months in summer, taking along their wise- cracking bawdy aunt Elizabeth (a treat to see Bette Davis in almost anything). Even Burgess Meridith, Elieen Heckert, and Dub Taylor add considerable gravitas to the affair in their brief cameos at the start of the flick. The film has another huge asset to help hide the workman-like direction of Dan Curtis...the house. It really is an excellent, classic piece of horror design, and the fact that it's real just adds to the mystique. The main problem I have is with its stale '70s-ness. The TV movie-esqe score only needs a Theramin wailing to be even more corny, the scene with Oliver Reed roughing up his son while possessed is terrifying as played by the always manic actor, but is it not apparent that he's manhandling a DUMMY half the time? Simiilarly, the fake brick chimney collapsing at the end, capped with the ridiculously stupid screaming freeze frame of Lee Montgomery is almost worth a chuckle. And another thing...Montgomery's acting. Wow, all I can say is child actors have come a long way since the only criteria was to "look cute." Don't get me wrong...Burnt Offerings is still worth your time. It has so many elements going for it. If only they could have found a director who knew exactly how to serve up aged cheese...like maybe Brian DePalma ala "Sisters."

    Based on Robert Marasco's novel, film tells the story of young family Ben, Marian, and Davey(Oliver Reed, Karen Black, Lee Montgomery) who, along with his aunt(Bette Davis) rent a country house from July 1 until Labor Day for the small sum of $900 Dollars. They can't believe their good luck, until increasingly strange, then sinister occurrences convince them that the house is haunted, and out to get them... Though atmospheric and at times eerie, this thriller is too slow moving, since it has several redundant sequences. Famous ending may come as a surprise, but also veers too close to being melodramatic and unintentionally funny. Watchable enough way to spend nearly two hours, but director Dan Curtis had done better, though film almost works...but not quite!

    The Chauffeur alone would have made this one of the creepiest horror films ever made. I literally went into tears because of his dark character. The cast couldn't have been better. To have Betty Davis, Karen Black, and Oliver Reed in your picture... the director had to know he would end up with a classic. The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention, the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor, watch Burnt Offerings.

    If you are looking for blood, gore, or loud jump scares, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather than resorting to cheap tactics, this film focuses heavily on atmosphere, suspense, and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film, that the first time I watched it, I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your run-of-the-mill haunted house film when you simply read the summary, but when you actually watch the film, it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated, chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that, they are both wonderful. It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies, but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly, that was not meant to happen. Overall, this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.

    The 1970's were a great time for horror . This offering (no pun intended ) more than holds its own among many of the other classics from the same period . This haunted house story is very similar to both The Shining and The Amityville Horror and I might add Burnt Offerings predates both of those films . Great direction, cast and score. The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent ,as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film , it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way . The only horror movie of this type that I feel is better than this is The Shining , but not by much. Very recommended for fans of classy, well made horror.

    Haunted house chiller from Dan Curtis has Oliver Reed and Karen Black as summer caretakers moving into Gothic house with their young son... Some have said this is Dan Curtis' best film. I simply cannot agree with that, being such a fan of his work overall. I will say this one is a winner, though, with great genre actors Oliver Reed and Karen Black, an elderly Bette Davis and even Burgess Meredith. Quite the cast! The pace is a bit slower, and it may strike some people as boring if they are not prepared for a slow film. Through much of the movie, very little happens. And sometimes when it does happen, it becomes even more confusing (why people are sometimes under a spell and sometimes not is unclear). Did this film inspire "Evil Dead"? I would not say it is obvious, but the use of vines suggested this conclusion to me, as well as the fallen tree keeping the family from leaving the house... there is definitely that element of a cursed house with control over the surrounding woods. I find it interesting that this was the first film to feature the Dunsmuir Mansion in Oakland, and it has since appeared in "Phantasm" (1979), "Partners in Crime" (1984), "A View to a Kill" (1985), "The Vineyard" (1989), "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (1993), "Gloria" (1999) and "True Crime" (1999). If i ever make it out to Oakland, this is a place I need to visit for sure.

    I've always had a soft spot for Bette Davis (who could not?), but with her appearance in Burnt Offerings, she has become my old-lady idol. Screw wrinkles, she puts on her eyeliner anyway, and of course, it's liquid eyeliner. Red or orange lips and a black cigarette always in her hands, punctuating her bitter sarcasm. I adore her, with her little pooch stomach hanging out but stylish in bold floral prints, the height of seventies fashion. Karen Black is also strong as the loving wife who twists domesticity into horror. The ladies dominate this little movie with the one adult male figure (Oliver Reed as Black's husband) reduced to an infantile state, even further regressed than his son at one point when the wicked home and hearth has had its way with him. The ending was a surprise to me, not because of where the story leadsany horror fan could see that one comingbut because the young son is allowed to see his father cartwheel from the top of the house and is then covered with his father's blood when he splats on the family station wagon. That just doesn't happen any longer in Hollywood. Children are comforted and cosseted with happy endings, reassured that nothing traumatic can't be undone. Foreign filmmakers are more daring when dealing with children. I'm thinking of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage by Juan Antonio Bayona. I do remember critics saying that Pan's Labyrinth could never be made in today's Hollywood because of the traumatic ending that happens to a child.

    Slasher, gore & over-the-top, special effects fans, will most likely, not enjoy this old school, horror movie. I first saw this one in the theaters, during my high school days... It's always remained a favorite, mostly because of it's excellent, quirky cast & creepy details. As one viewer noted, the original novel was a direct influence on The Shinning. The cast includes, Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Betty Davis, Burgess Meredith, Eileen Heckart, Dub Taylor & the unforgettable, Anthony James. It's weaknesses lie mainly in the script & editing. I'm being picky, but if there's one weak link in the cast, it's Oliver Reed. In terms of a remake, in the right hands, Burnt Offerings could be an absolute classic! Dan Curtis directs...Known for TV's Dark Shadows & two, made for TV flicks, starring the excellent, Darren McGavin, as news reporter, Kolchak, in both 1973's, The Night Stalker & The Night Strangler. He also directed a couple of my personal favorite, made for TV, horror movies, starring the great, Jack Palance; 1968's, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde & 1974's, Dracula.

    By the 1970s, subtlety in Horror wasn't seen nearly as much. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, visceral thrills can be very effective in their own right. On the other, some times suspense and tension were sacrificed. There are however a few examples of the genre from this time that harken back to the old days. 'The Haunting' is a perfect example that showing very little can work. Based on the novel of the same name, 'Burnt Offerings' is more of an old fashioned ghost story. It's not a classic exactly, but has quite a bit going for it. Pros: Strong cast and performances. Eerie score. Great setting that's both beautiful and spooky. Neat concept. Moves at a steady pace most of the time. Nice job on the cinematography. A few good chills. Memorable ending. Cons: Occasionally plodding. Can be predictable. Looks more like a made for TV movie. Some plot holes. Could have used a little more oomph. Final thoughts: One could find much better films of this type. That being said, you could also find ones totally forgettable. If slow-paced, mostly suggestive from back in the day is your cup of tea, then give it a whirl. There are just enough goodies to make it worth the the 115 minutes. My rating: 3/5

    I was 12 when Burnt Offerings came out but I do remember it was the subject of a lot of jeering, both in the press and by my peers. I just watched it, 35 years later, on Netflix streaming and was both impressed and amused. Impressed, because, although the story is clunky, it's not without creepy, memorable moments. It couldn't be better cast, for one. Karen Black, who always had a vaguely campy and alien-like quality with her crossed eyes and inflated lips, and Oliver Reed, who can't ever play a part without exuding some primordial menace and anger (think "Tommy" and "Women In Love") are both perfect as the unsuspecting couple who rent the imposing Alardyce estate for a few months in summer, taking along their wise- cracking bawdy aunt Elizabeth (a treat to see Bette Davis in almost anything). Even Burgess Meridith, Elieen Heckert, and Dub Taylor add considerable gravitas to the affair in their brief cameos at the start of the flick. The film has another huge asset to help hide the workman-like direction of Dan Curtis...the house. It really is an excellent, classic piece of horror design, and the fact that it's real just adds to the mystique. The main problem I have is with its stale '70s-ness. The TV movie-esqe score only needs a Theramin wailing to be even more corny, the scene with Oliver Reed roughing up his son while possessed is terrifying as played by the always manic actor, but is it not apparent that he's manhandling a DUMMY half the time? Simiilarly, the fake brick chimney collapsing at the end, capped with the ridiculously stupid screaming freeze frame of Lee Montgomery is almost worth a chuckle. And another thing...Montgomery's acting. Wow, all I can say is child actors have come a long way since the only criteria was to "look cute." Don't get me wrong...Burnt Offerings is still worth your time. It has so many elements going for it. If only they could have found a director who knew exactly how to serve up aged cheese...like maybe Brian DePalma ala "Sisters."

    I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it only got worse not the actors or anything like that its the long drawn out story and the deaths no real woman would risk her family like that. I was totally dissatisfied with the movie and the two hours I wasted watching it. The actors in the main part of the movie Are great totally drew me in. But just didn't enjoy it. I am sorry but I just don't like it. This review thing makes you use so many lines and I can't think of anything else to say. The restoration of the house after each incident was clearly attached to the deaths or violence. And the wife's transformation including the change of the way she dressed the grey that quickly appeared in her hair and her attitude was so clearly attached to house _ It was ridiculous. Like I said I waited for it to get better but it was not in the cards

    The Chauffeur alone would have made this one of the creepiest horror films ever made. I literally went into tears because of his dark character. The cast couldn't have been better. To have Betty Davis, Karen Black, and Oliver Reed in your picture... the director had to know he would end up with a classic. The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention, the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor, watch Burnt Offerings.

    If you are looking for blood, gore, or loud jump scares, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather than resorting to cheap tactics, this film focuses heavily on atmosphere, suspense, and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film, that the first time I watched it, I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your run-of-the-mill haunted house film when you simply read the summary, but when you actually watch the film, it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated, chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that, they are both wonderful. It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies, but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly, that was not meant to happen. Overall, this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.

    The 1970's were a great time for horror . This offering (no pun intended ) more than holds its own among many of the other classics from the same period . This haunted house story is very similar to both The Shining and The Amityville Horror and I might add Burnt Offerings predates both of those films . Great direction, cast and score. The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent ,as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film , it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way . The only horror movie of this type that I feel is better than this is The Shining , but not by much. Very recommended for fans of classy, well made horror.

    Haunted house chiller from Dan Curtis has Oliver Reed and Karen Black as summer caretakers moving into Gothic house with their young son... Some have said this is Dan Curtis' best film. I simply cannot agree with that, being such a fan of his work overall. I will say this one is a winner, though, with great genre actors Oliver Reed and Karen Black, an elderly Bette Davis and even Burgess Meredith. Quite the cast! The pace is a bit slower, and it may strike some people as boring if they are not prepared for a slow film. Through much of the movie, very little happens. And sometimes when it does happen, it becomes even more confusing (why people are sometimes under a spell and sometimes not is unclear). Did this film inspire "Evil Dead"? I would not say it is obvious, but the use of vines suggested this conclusion to me, as well as the fallen tree keeping the family from leaving the house... there is definitely that element of a cursed house with control over the surrounding woods. I find it interesting that this was the first film to feature the Dunsmuir Mansion in Oakland, and it has since appeared in "Phantasm" (1979), "Partners in Crime" (1984), "A View to a Kill" (1985), "The Vineyard" (1989), "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (1993), "Gloria" (1999) and "True Crime" (1999). If i ever make it out to Oakland, this is a place I need to visit for sure.

    I've always had a soft spot for Bette Davis (who could not?), but with her appearance in Burnt Offerings, she has become my old-lady idol. Screw wrinkles, she puts on her eyeliner anyway, and of course, it's liquid eyeliner. Red or orange lips and a black cigarette always in her hands, punctuating her bitter sarcasm. I adore her, with her little pooch stomach hanging out but stylish in bold floral prints, the height of seventies fashion. Karen Black is also strong as the loving wife who twists domesticity into horror. The ladies dominate this little movie with the one adult male figure (Oliver Reed as Black's husband) reduced to an infantile state, even further regressed than his son at one point when the wicked home and hearth has had its way with him. The ending was a surprise to me, not because of where the story leadsany horror fan could see that one comingbut because the young son is allowed to see his father cartwheel from the top of the house and is then covered with his father's blood when he splats on the family station wagon. That just doesn't happen any longer in Hollywood. Children are comforted and cosseted with happy endings, reassured that nothing traumatic can't be undone. Foreign filmmakers are more daring when dealing with children. I'm thinking of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage by Juan Antonio Bayona. I do remember critics saying that Pan's Labyrinth could never be made in today's Hollywood because of the traumatic ending that happens to a child.

    Slasher, gore & over-the-top, special effects fans, will most likely, not enjoy this old school, horror movie. I first saw this one in the theaters, during my high school days... It's always remained a favorite, mostly because of it's excellent, quirky cast & creepy details. As one viewer noted, the original novel was a direct influence on The Shinning. The cast includes, Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Betty Davis, Burgess Meredith, Eileen Heckart, Dub Taylor & the unforgettable, Anthony James. It's weaknesses lie mainly in the script & editing. I'm being picky, but if there's one weak link in the cast, it's Oliver Reed. In terms of a remake, in the right hands, Burnt Offerings could be an absolute classic! Dan Curtis directs...Known for TV's Dark Shadows & two, made for TV flicks, starring the excellent, Darren McGavin, as news reporter, Kolchak, in both 1973's, The Night Stalker & The Night Strangler. He also directed a couple of my personal favorite, made for TV, horror movies, starring the great, Jack Palance; 1968's, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde & 1974's, Dracula.

    By the 1970s, subtlety in Horror wasn't seen nearly as much. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, visceral thrills can be very effective in their own right. On the other, some times suspense and tension were sacrificed. There are however a few examples of the genre from this time that harken back to the old days. 'The Haunting' is a perfect example that showing very little can work. Based on the novel of the same name, 'Burnt Offerings' is more of an old fashioned ghost story. It's not a classic exactly, but has quite a bit going for it. Pros: Strong cast and performances. Eerie score. Great setting that's both beautiful and spooky. Neat concept. Moves at a steady pace most of the time. Nice job on the cinematography. A few good chills. Memorable ending. Cons: Occasionally plodding. Can be predictable. Looks more like a made for TV movie. Some plot holes. Could have used a little more oomph. Final thoughts: One could find much better films of this type. That being said, you could also find ones totally forgettable. If slow-paced, mostly suggestive from back in the day is your cup of tea, then give it a whirl. There are just enough goodies to make it worth the the 115 minutes. My rating: 3/5

    I was 12 when Burnt Offerings came out but I do remember it was the subject of a lot of jeering, both in the press and by my peers. I just watched it, 35 years later, on Netflix streaming and was both impressed and amused. Impressed, because, although the story is clunky, it's not without creepy, memorable moments. It couldn't be better cast, for one. Karen Black, who always had a vaguely campy and alien-like quality with her crossed eyes and inflated lips, and Oliver Reed, who can't ever play a part without exuding some primordial menace and anger (think "Tommy" and "Women In Love") are both perfect as the unsuspecting couple who rent the imposing Alardyce estate for a few months in summer, taking along their wise- cracking bawdy aunt Elizabeth (a treat to see Bette Davis in almost anything). Even Burgess Meridith, Elieen Heckert, and Dub Taylor add considerable gravitas to the affair in their brief cameos at the start of the flick. The film has another huge asset to help hide the workman-like direction of Dan Curtis...the house. It really is an excellent, classic piece of horror design, and the fact that it's real just adds to the mystique. The main problem I have is with its stale '70s-ness. The TV movie-esqe score only needs a Theramin wailing to be even more corny, the scene with Oliver Reed roughing up his son while possessed is terrifying as played by the always manic actor, but is it not apparent that he's manhandling a DUMMY half the time? Simiilarly, the fake brick chimney collapsing at the end, capped with the ridiculously stupid screaming freeze frame of Lee Montgomery is almost worth a chuckle. And another thing...Montgomery's acting. Wow, all I can say is child actors have come a long way since the only criteria was to "look cute." Don't get me wrong...Burnt Offerings is still worth your time. It has so many elements going for it. If only they could have found a director who knew exactly how to serve up aged cheese...like maybe Brian DePalma ala "Sisters."

    I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it only got worse not the actors or anything like that its the long drawn out story and the deaths no real woman would risk her family like that. I was totally dissatisfied with the movie and the two hours I wasted watching it. The actors in the main part of the movie Are great totally drew me in. But just didn't enjoy it. I am sorry but I just don't like it. This review thing makes you use so many lines and I can't think of anything else to say. The restoration of the house after each incident was clearly attached to the deaths or violence. And the wife's transformation including the change of the way she dressed the grey that quickly appeared in her hair and her attitude was so clearly attached to house _ It was ridiculous. Like I said I waited for it to get better but it was not in the cards

    Based on Robert Marasco's novel, film tells the story of young family Ben, Marian, and Davey(Oliver Reed, Karen Black, Lee Montgomery) who, along with his aunt(Bette Davis) rent a country house from July 1 until Labor Day for the small sum of $900 Dollars. They can't believe their good luck, until increasingly strange, then sinister occurrences convince them that the house is haunted, and out to get them... Though atmospheric and at times eerie, this thriller is too slow moving, since it has several redundant sequences. Famous ending may come as a surprise, but also veers too close to being melodramatic and unintentionally funny. Watchable enough way to spend nearly two hours, but director Dan Curtis had done better, though film almost works...but not quite!

    If you are looking for blood, gore, or loud jump scares, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather than resorting to cheap tactics, this film focuses heavily on atmosphere, suspense, and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film, that the first time I watched it, I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your run-of-the-mill haunted house film when you simply read the summary, but when you actually watch the film, it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated, chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that, they are both wonderful. It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies, but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly, that was not meant to happen. Overall, this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.

    The 1970's were a great time for horror . This offering (no pun intended ) more than holds its own among many of the other classics from the same period . This haunted house story is very similar to both The Shining and The Amityville Horror and I might add Burnt Offerings predates both of those films . Great direction, cast and score. The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent ,as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film , it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way . The only horror movie of this type that I feel is better than this is The Shining , but not by much. Very recommended for fans of classy, well made horror.

    Haunted house chiller from Dan Curtis has Oliver Reed and Karen Black as summer caretakers moving into Gothic house with their young son... Some have said this is Dan Curtis' best film. I simply cannot agree with that, being such a fan of his work overall. I will say this one is a winner, though, with great genre actors Oliver Reed and Karen Black, an elderly Bette Davis and even Burgess Meredith. Quite the cast! The pace is a bit slower, and it may strike some people as boring if they are not prepared for a slow film. Through much of the movie, very little happens. And sometimes when it does happen, it becomes even more confusing (why people are sometimes under a spell and sometimes not is unclear). Did this film inspire "Evil Dead"? I would not say it is obvious, but the use of vines suggested this conclusion to me, as well as the fallen tree keeping the family from leaving the house... there is definitely that element of a cursed house with control over the surrounding woods. I find it interesting that this was the first film to feature the Dunsmuir Mansion in Oakland, and it has since appeared in "Phantasm" (1979), "Partners in Crime" (1984), "A View to a Kill" (1985), "The Vineyard" (1989), "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (1993), "Gloria" (1999) and "True Crime" (1999). If i ever make it out to Oakland, this is a place I need to visit for sure.

    I've always had a soft spot for Bette Davis (who could not?), but with her appearance in Burnt Offerings, she has become my old-lady idol. Screw wrinkles, she puts on her eyeliner anyway, and of course, it's liquid eyeliner. Red or orange lips and a black cigarette always in her hands, punctuating her bitter sarcasm. I adore her, with her little pooch stomach hanging out but stylish in bold floral prints, the height of seventies fashion. Karen Black is also strong as the loving wife who twists domesticity into horror. The ladies dominate this little movie with the one adult male figure (Oliver Reed as Black's husband) reduced to an infantile state, even further regressed than his son at one point when the wicked home and hearth has had its way with him. The ending was a surprise to me, not because of where the story leadsany horror fan could see that one comingbut because the young son is allowed to see his father cartwheel from the top of the house and is then covered with his father's blood when he splats on the family station wagon. That just doesn't happen any longer in Hollywood. Children are comforted and cosseted with happy endings, reassured that nothing traumatic can't be undone. Foreign filmmakers are more daring when dealing with children. I'm thinking of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage by Juan Antonio Bayona. I do remember critics saying that Pan's Labyrinth could never be made in today's Hollywood because of the traumatic ending that happens to a child.

    Slasher, gore & over-the-top, special effects fans, will most likely, not enjoy this old school, horror movie. I first saw this one in the theaters, during my high school days... It's always remained a favorite, mostly because of it's excellent, quirky cast & creepy details. As one viewer noted, the original novel was a direct influence on The Shinning. The cast includes, Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Betty Davis, Burgess Meredith, Eileen Heckart, Dub Taylor & the unforgettable, Anthony James. It's weaknesses lie mainly in the script & editing. I'm being picky, but if there's one weak link in the cast, it's Oliver Reed. In terms of a remake, in the right hands, Burnt Offerings could be an absolute classic! Dan Curtis directs...Known for TV's Dark Shadows & two, made for TV flicks, starring the excellent, Darren McGavin, as news reporter, Kolchak, in both 1973's, The Night Stalker & The Night Strangler. He also directed a couple of my personal favorite, made for TV, horror movies, starring the great, Jack Palance; 1968's, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde & 1974's, Dracula.

    By the 1970s, subtlety in Horror wasn't seen nearly as much. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, visceral thrills can be very effective in their own right. On the other, some times suspense and tension were sacrificed. There are however a few examples of the genre from this time that harken back to the old days. 'The Haunting' is a perfect example that showing very little can work. Based on the novel of the same name, 'Burnt Offerings' is more of an old fashioned ghost story. It's not a classic exactly, but has quite a bit going for it. Pros: Strong cast and performances. Eerie score. Great setting that's both beautiful and spooky. Neat concept. Moves at a steady pace most of the time. Nice job on the cinematography. A few good chills. Memorable ending. Cons: Occasionally plodding. Can be predictable. Looks more like a made for TV movie. Some plot holes. Could have used a little more oomph. Final thoughts: One could find much better films of this type. That being said, you could also find ones totally forgettable. If slow-paced, mostly suggestive from back in the day is your cup of tea, then give it a whirl. There are just enough goodies to make it worth the the 115 minutes. My rating: 3/5

    I was 12 when Burnt Offerings came out but I do remember it was the subject of a lot of jeering, both in the press and by my peers. I just watched it, 35 years later, on Netflix streaming and was both impressed and amused. Impressed, because, although the story is clunky, it's not without creepy, memorable moments. It couldn't be better cast, for one. Karen Black, who always had a vaguely campy and alien-like quality with her crossed eyes and inflated lips, and Oliver Reed, who can't ever play a part without exuding some primordial menace and anger (think "Tommy" and "Women In Love") are both perfect as the unsuspecting couple who rent the imposing Alardyce estate for a few months in summer, taking along their wise- cracking bawdy aunt Elizabeth (a treat to see Bette Davis in almost anything). Even Burgess Meridith, Elieen Heckert, and Dub Taylor add considerable gravitas to the affair in their brief cameos at the start of the flick. The film has another huge asset to help hide the workman-like direction of Dan Curtis...the house. It really is an excellent, classic piece of horror design, and the fact that it's real just adds to the mystique. The main problem I have is with its stale '70s-ness. The TV movie-esqe score only needs a Theramin wailing to be even more corny, the scene with Oliver Reed roughing up his son while possessed is terrifying as played by the always manic actor, but is it not apparent that he's manhandling a DUMMY half the time? Simiilarly, the fake brick chimney collapsing at the end, capped with the ridiculously stupid screaming freeze frame of Lee Montgomery is almost worth a chuckle. And another thing...Montgomery's acting. Wow, all I can say is child actors have come a long way since the only criteria was to "look cute." Don't get me wrong...Burnt Offerings is still worth your time. It has so many elements going for it. If only they could have found a director who knew exactly how to serve up aged cheese...like maybe Brian DePalma ala "Sisters."

    I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better but it only got worse not the actors or anything like that its the long drawn out story and the deaths no real woman would risk her family like that. I was totally dissatisfied with the movie and the two hours I wasted watching it. The actors in the main part of the movie Are great totally drew me in. But just didn't enjoy it. I am sorry but I just don't like it. This review thing makes you use so many lines and I can't think of anything else to say. The restoration of the house after each incident was clearly attached to the deaths or violence. And the wife's transformation including the change of the way she dressed the grey that quickly appeared in her hair and her attitude was so clearly attached to house _ It was ridiculous. Like I said I waited for it to get better but it was not in the cards

    Based on Robert Marasco's novel, film tells the story of young family Ben, Marian, and Davey(Oliver Reed, Karen Black, Lee Montgomery) who, along with his aunt(Bette Davis) rent a country house from July 1 until Labor Day for the small sum of $900 Dollars. They can't believe their good luck, until increasingly strange, then sinister occurrences convince them that the house is haunted, and out to get them... Though atmospheric and at times eerie, this thriller is too slow moving, since it has several redundant sequences. Famous ending may come as a surprise, but also veers too close to being melodramatic and unintentionally funny. Watchable enough way to spend nearly two hours, but director Dan Curtis had done better, though film almost works...but not quite!

    The Chauffeur alone would have made this one of the creepiest horror films ever made. I literally went into tears because of his dark character. The cast couldn't have been better. To have Betty Davis, Karen Black, and Oliver Reed in your picture... the director had to know he would end up with a classic. The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention, the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor, watch Burnt Offerings.
