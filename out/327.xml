    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows. But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

    Sylvester Stallone returns to the more gritty character kind of roles he had earlier in his career. In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    cop land is not a stallone action picture like 'first blood' or 'cobra', but it is a great cop thriller about corruption in new jersey, it has a great cast including harvey kietel, robert de niro and ray liotta. and while they have all been in better movies, they all do good in there roles, and for the most part the acting is top notch, and stallone gives a very good yet subtle performance, a far cry from his action persona. and even though it shouldn't work, the movie does, and its great, its got a great script, and is well directed. its easy to see why this movie wasn't a hit when it came out, but the years have been kind to cop land, and now its finally getting recognised as a solid cop picture, i recommend cop land

    Corrupt Cops, Cover-ups & A Sheriff's Remarkable Transition

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows. But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

    Sylvester Stallone returns to the more gritty character kind of roles he had earlier in his career. In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

    Sylvester Stallone returns to the more gritty character kind of roles he had earlier in his career. In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    cop land is not a stallone action picture like 'first blood' or 'cobra', but it is a great cop thriller about corruption in new jersey, it has a great cast including harvey kietel, robert de niro and ray liotta. and while they have all been in better movies, they all do good in there roles, and for the most part the acting is top notch, and stallone gives a very good yet subtle performance, a far cry from his action persona. and even though it shouldn't work, the movie does, and its great, its got a great script, and is well directed. its easy to see why this movie wasn't a hit when it came out, but the years have been kind to cop land, and now its finally getting recognised as a solid cop picture, i recommend cop land

    Corrupt Cops, Cover-ups & A Sheriff's Remarkable Transition

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows.

The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows. But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

    Sylvester Stallone returns to the more gritty character kind of roles he had earlier in his career. In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows. But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.

    I have watched a lot of movies, probably not too unlike a lot of us on here. I don't discriminate, from Hollywood blockbusters to obscure foreign titles, I love them all, but for some reason or another this is the only movie that has compelled me to write a review ! I pulled out Copland from my movie library as I hadn't seen it for many years and suddenly just remembered how good I had thought it was. Containing a stellar cast, the movie itself is very undervalued in my humble opinion, I mean the genre has been done to death, but the movie has a certain ambiance I just can't put my finger on, maybe the setting of the small town in the shadow of the big smoke is just something I like, who knows. But Stallone was absolutely great in this movie, as he had been in Rocky, another brilliant film that the genre has been done to death, and Rambo. I think Stallone gets a bad wrap sometimes, granted he has done some pretty average films, but he has some talent, it's a narrow typecast, but still. I just had a quick look, he won the Best Actor award at the Stockholm film festival for this role haha. Anyway, just my two cents worth. If you like Stallone & you have not seen this, for mine, it's one of his best and a very decent movie too boot.

    Cop Land is your classic morality tale surrounding police, their ties to the criminal underworld and their struggle to avoid Internal Affairs from the point of view of small town sheriff, played by Sylvester Stallone. It's not really your standard issue cop film like The Curroptor or anything of that kind. Cop Land focuses more on the drama and characters and leaves the shooting for the last 10 minutes. Stallone really shines in Cop Land with his very subtle and wonderfully underplayed performance as the small town sheriff. It's easily one of his better performances up there with First Blood and Rocky. I'm very sad that Stallone never really did any dramatic work beside few films. He is a very capable actor, despite what many people thinks of him. The supporting cast is from top to bottom excellent. We have Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Robert Patrick, Ray Liotta to name a few. It's all around a solid cast with very good actors doing what they do best. Where the Cop Land slightly falls flat is the script. There are many subplots that are unresolved, sometimes the melodrama takes over and just bizarre scenes happen out of nowhere. It's not a convoluted mess, but a more focus would have helped the overall narrative. Everything surrounding Liz character was left unresolved which did bother me a lot since her subplot was essential to the Stallone's character. It just felt that adding 20 minutes to the runtime would have made it better. As for everything else, it's fine. The shooting is bloody with nice fake blood, in strip bars there actual nudity and the men swear like real men. Cop Land just feels like a film made for adults not for that PG-13 crowd. It's nowhere near as good looking as Friedkin's or Michael Mann's films or even Scorcese's work, but it's well shot and has a nice feel to it. If you like cop films that offer more than just criminals getting shot or scenery chewing villains, Cop Land is just for you. It's well made, well acted cop film which prefers characters and drama over explosions and carnage. And if you want to see Stallone acting opposite some great talent.

    Sylvester Stallone returns to the more gritty character kind of roles he had earlier in his career. In the late '70's and early '80's prior to doing the Rambo type of movies Sylvester Stallone was more then just an action movie star. Back when he did the first 2 Rocky movies, F.I.S.T. and movies like that his movies had a lot more depth to him then when he was doing shallower less challenging roles like Tango & Cash, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man. Not to say I didn't enjoy those movies of his but they're not really movies you say, "wow that was that was a great acting performance". In Cop Land, Stallone isn't afraid of losing a few ego points from playing an out of shape small town cop who's half deaf. The movie also has a great supporting cast with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta, amongst others. This is the first time that acting legends like DeNiro and Liotta were in the same movie since Taxi Driver.

    Garrison, N.J., is a haven for cops - lots of cops. We are led to believe this idyllic town was created, and for the most part funded, by the Mob so that NYC cops could live a life isolated from the daily crime ridden day-to-day reality of the Big Apple. But even fairy tale towns need a sheriff, and this town's sheriff is none other than Sylvester Stallone. A seemingly meek turn the other cheek kind of guy just trying to do his best. A sort of country bumpkin kind of guy. The town's past is sordid. Strange things happened to cops that live in Garrison. As the story progresses, strange things continue to happen to cops who don't toe the line and fall out of favor with the ruling clique run by Harvey Keitel. I liked this movie. It is a bit slow at times, but the story is unique enough to keep you interested and performances by the main characters are, by and large, quite good. Give it a try - it is worth your time.

    The cops working in New York City don't want their families growing up there so they move them across the George Washington Bridge into the small town of Garrison, New Jersey. The local sheriff, "Freddy Heflin" (Sylvester Stallone) goes about his business totally unaware that bad cops, led by "Ray Donlan" (Harvey Keitel), have sold out to the mob and look the other way while certain crimes are being committed in New York. Unfortunately, some of the problems associated with these corrupt cops begins to take root in Garrison as well. Most notably, a cop named "Murray Babitch" (Michael Rapaport) who accidentally kills two young black men and has faked his suicide but is being hidden in Garrison by Ray Donlan. However, when the investigation begins to interfere with Ray Donlan's operation the decision is made to have Murray killed. When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    cop land is not a stallone action picture like 'first blood' or 'cobra', but it is a great cop thriller about corruption in new jersey, it has a great cast including harvey kietel, robert de niro and ray liotta. and while they have all been in better movies, they all do good in there roles, and for the most part the acting is top notch, and stallone gives a very good yet subtle performance, a far cry from his action persona. and even though it shouldn't work, the movie does, and its great, its got a great script, and is well directed. its easy to see why this movie wasn't a hit when it came out, but the years have been kind to cop land, and now its finally getting recognised as a solid cop picture, i recommend cop land

    Corrupt Cops, Cover-ups & A Sheriff's Remarkable Transition

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting.

When Sheriff Heflin becomes aware of this he has to take matters into his own hands and that means crossing Ray Donlan and the rest of the crooked cops living in his town. There are several subplots involved but rather than get into all of them I'll just say that this is an enjoyable film that captures both the local town setting and the big metropolis right across the Hudson River. Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job as the honest but slow-witted sheriff. I also liked the performance of Robert De Niro as the Internal Affairs officer, "Moe Tilden" and Ray Liotta as one of the crooked cops named "Gary Figgis" who just wants out. In short, if a person is looking for a pretty good crime-drama film, then this should definitely be considered.

    Cop Land is a crime drama that features an ensemble cast featuring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Garofalo, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Michael Rapaport, Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Arthur Nascarella, and John Spencer.It is written and directed by James Mangold. The is about Freddy Heflin(Stallone), the much-denigrated sheriff of tiny Garrison, NJ, a community which -- thanks to a technicality -- is populated almost entirely by members of the New York City Police Department. When young cop Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Rapaport) becomes embroiled in a controversial shoot-out which leaves two black youths dead, he apparently commits suicide rather than face the wrath of an official investigation. In reality, however, he flees to safety back home in Garrison. In the wake of the controversial events, NYPD Internal Affairs lieutenant Moe Tilden (De Niro) arrives in Garrison to uncover the truth, attempting to enlist Freddy to help watch the watchmen, including Superboy's uncle, veteran cop Ray Donlan (Keitel); coked-out Gary Figgis (Liotta); and Joey Randone (Berg), the husband of the woman (Sciorra) Freddy loved and lost. A rich, complex film about redemption despite being too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material. Stallone tries to prove his worth as an actor in a dramatic feature - far from the action films that he is used to doing for box office purposes.Take note that he gained 40 pounds the role of Heflin and not the muscles required to the films like Rocky and Rambo.And he definitely does not disappoint as he gives his best performance ever as an actor - even better than his Oscar nominated role for Rocky I. And playing along side De Niro and Keitel even proved that he definitely could act. Watch him play in a role of a non-traditional action flick is worth the price of admission.

    Between the period making Rocky V and Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone struggled how to defy himself as an actor, making a range of movies from Cliffhanger to Get Carter to Stop or Mum Will Shoot. Cop Land is easily the best quality film in this period. The town of Garrison, New Jersey is a town build for NYPD officers to escape New York life. Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the sheriff of the town who is friends with many of the cops in the town. But he is also a man who wanted to be one of the them, but can't because of an injury he received when he was a teenager. In New York a young hero cop Murray "Superbad" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) ends up killing two African-American teens after they shoot his car. Fearing that he was going to be arrested and be considered responsible for a racist incident Murray fakes his death thanks to his corrupt uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel). Internal Affair officer Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is assigned the cast to investigate the crime and suspects major links between Ray and Mafia. He tries to get Freddy on side but Freddy is torn between his duties as an officer and his loyalty to his friends. Writer/Director James Mangold fit's a lot of story and subplots in a 1 hour 45 minute package. If anything he is a bit too ambitious for its own good. At times it felt like he was adapting a novel but had to cut some stuff to make the film fit. In a way it meanders a little bit. But for the most part Mangold makes sure that Cop Land was interesting, fast paced thriller that does not treat the audience like an idiot, even if it does have a few clich&eacute; moments and focused dialogue. Cop Land has a great cast and Stallone shows he can act very well when required. He physically is not his muscular as he normally is, having a beer belly and looking more like typical middle-age man just past his prime. It was one of his most grounded performance from him which worked and he should do serious roles where he can show he can act. The rest of the cast is solid throughout, particularly from De Niro and Keitel who are top actors and Mangold does get performances from his actors. Howard Shore provides an excellent, bass scores that is fitting the film, but this is what you would expect from the guy who gave us the music for Lord of the Rings and it was shot very much like other 90s thrillers like Heat. Cop Land is a solidly entertaining film that fans of thrillers. It is worth checking out.

    cop land is not a stallone action picture like 'first blood' or 'cobra', but it is a great cop thriller about corruption in new jersey, it has a great cast including harvey kietel, robert de niro and ray liotta. and while they have all been in better movies, they all do good in there roles, and for the most part the acting is top notch, and stallone gives a very good yet subtle performance, a far cry from his action persona. and even though it shouldn't work, the movie does, and its great, its got a great script, and is well directed. its easy to see why this movie wasn't a hit when it came out, but the years have been kind to cop land, and now its finally getting recognised as a solid cop picture, i recommend cop land

    Corrupt Cops, Cover-ups & A Sheriff's Remarkable Transition

    "Cop Land" is a tense story about corrupt cops, cover-ups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other. The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to "Cop Land" because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses. Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray "Superboy" Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation. A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions. Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business. Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city. Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout. Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round, but Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.

    I first watched this when it was relatively new, in the 90's or early 00's. I have a vague memory that this was the time when independent productions or movies with an "independent feel" raised their head. Could be that I was just gaining interest in such movies back then. For any reason, this movie really struck me as a near perfect drama movie back then. Having watched it again recently, it was pretty much as good as I remembered. It's quite strange that it hasn't gained more of a classic status or better score here on IMDb. Afterall it's got amazing cast and performance by Stallone is just plain great. Not just great for Stallone, but great for anyone. I'm still surprised that he didn't get a nomination for his role. It's been said that the story is not as tight as it could be, and it's somewhat true. I don't know if it needs to be any tighter tho. The whole movie has a mellow, yet intense feel to it, it's just pleasure to watch the acting. The story doesn't feel as important as the performances here. And the story is not bad by any means. After maybe ten years or so, I couldn't remember how it unfolded and I was gripped all the way. In a way this movie makes me sad that Stallone didn't pursue a different career. I've always felt he shouldn't be mixed with the other "muscular" action guys, but that's the image people have. Try suggesting your date you'll go watch a Stallone movie and see what happens.. It could be different. I wouldn't be surprised if many people overlook this gem because of the leading actor. A great movie. Definitely holds it's place in movie history if for nothing else, great direction and performances.
