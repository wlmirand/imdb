    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

    yep.... this movie accurately portrays sheeple(humans)back then(17th century) as stupid like most are to this very day! lol. Moral? It's easier to judge and condemn in fear of the unknown. Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

    yep.... this movie accurately portrays sheeple(humans)back then(17th century) as stupid like most are to this very day! lol. Moral? It's easier to judge and condemn in fear of the unknown. Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth.

I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams.

This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth.

So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

    yep.... this movie accurately portrays sheeple(humans)back then(17th century) as stupid like most are to this very day! lol. Moral? It's easier to judge and condemn in fear of the unknown. Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft.

The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth.

I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    Written by Arthur Miller & based on his play of the same name, 'The Crucible' offers Great Performances by its terrific cast. While as a film, it engages in parts. 'The Crucible' Synopsis: A salem women accuses her ex lover's wife of witchcraft. 'The Crucible' is masterfully shot by Andrew Dunn & honestly Written by Miller. The Writing appeals in parts, although the slow-pace does hamper its overall impact. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is passable. 'The Crucible' is rich when it comes to performances. Joan Allen is fantastic, while Daniel Day-Lewis is persuasive. Winona Ryder is remarkably credible. Paul Scofield is effortless & classy. Bruce Davison is in brilliant form. Jeffrey Jones & Rob Campbell are fabulous. Peter Vaughan is highly competent. On the whole, 'The Crucible' has its share of pluses & minuses.

    This story is terribly difficult to watch. The blood lust of the people to condemn their neighbors to death is disgusting and infuriating!! I wish I could see those people suffer to their own deaths as they made innocent people die in suffering. It was too awful to watch for me. The level of ignorance in those with power and influence was astounding. I wished someone would shoot that Judge in the head and those who supported his judgment!!! And to think of the division we suffer today amongst the right and left in the US and the language many people use today against one another, it scares me that something like this could occur today, differently but the same.

    yep.... this movie accurately portrays sheeple(humans)back then(17th century) as stupid like most are to this very day! lol. Moral? It's easier to judge and condemn in fear of the unknown. Typical humans! Good performances by Winona Ryder and Lewis. Winona is great in any movie though. What the hell. Will give this a 10 for performances and accuracy of human beings. As for the movie itself well it's OK if you don't think about the movie and simply enjoy the acting.................. ....................... ...................... .................... ................... ................. ...............

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.

    Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable. One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties. But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding. Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better. I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore. Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.

    The Crucible **** (out of 4) 124 mins/ 12 Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter Vaughan Director: Nicholas Hytner Plot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil. JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence Â– and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out. All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.

    In the reading the reviews and comments here, I find it unfortunate that some of our reviewers seem to think that brilliant has to be exciting. It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails. The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend. There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.

    The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' "The Crucible." But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one. Anyway, I finally decided to actually view "The Crucible" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord. I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics. I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach. GRADE: C+

    The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end.

This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare "witch hunts" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

    At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.

    The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.
