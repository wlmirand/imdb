    Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.

    "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?" I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed. The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film

    Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.

    "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?" I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed. The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film

    Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.

    "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?" I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed. The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film

    Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.

    "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?" I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed. The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film

    Let's start with that this movie is about a bunch of junkies. And let's end with that. The lead characters are a group of drug addicts who put themselves in that position. Whetehr or some took responsibility for their actions is difficult to tell. That would be the only redeeming quality to this movie. I just don't care about the characters. If the O.D., should I care? I don't care. I feel bad for their families, who may be innocent victims of their stupid drug use. The production quality of Trainspotting was fine. The acting was also pretty much good, but I hated the story. I hated the characters. I didn't sympathize with them at all, nor the writer and director for their waste of millions of dollars in making this unimportant garbage. I would give the movie a 1, but it was well made.

    "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?" I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed. The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him. For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

    Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them, (spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.

    To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two. Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary "anti- hero", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?

    You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. "Shallow Grave" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, "Trainspotting" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on "his own sensory addiction." He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!

    I don't really care much for what people are saying about this movie, about how there is a deeper meaning to it all, etc etc blah blah blah, quite literally you will see a lot of sh!t in this movie. There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted. Don't believe me, watch the 2 scenes where Renton goes after pills in a sh!tpot and Spud gets sh!t all over his girlfriend and her parents. Deplorable!

    I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay. Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful! Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant. Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine. BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Profanity: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Nudity: Very Critical | Sex/Porn: Very Critical | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Drugs: Infinity

    Danny Boyle did a brilliant job with directing this film and the acting is some of the best I've seen. The view on drug use and the portrayal of the character's lifestyles is also spot on. What I didn't like about this film, or moreover could definitely be improved, was the script. Sure the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them. That said, the film delivers a feast of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing. Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film.

    Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit. Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film
