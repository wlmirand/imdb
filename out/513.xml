  An out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has lead to a flourishing black market.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances.

Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil.

"The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10

    Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so. Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI). Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.

    Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made Somehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly. The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.) Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10

    Since not many years ago I usually avoided watching old films. I was the typical teen or young man who hated when my parents were selecting old movies to watch after lunch on the weekends. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or I realize that sometimes you can agree with your parents movie taste, that I can truly appreciate some old jewels. And I'm sure there are people who have or had thoughts similar to mines. Especially for all of them I want to recommend "The Third Man". It's a movie which deserves to be watched if you haven't yet. It's just brilliant, the acting and dialog, the scenery in post WWII occupied Vienna, the music, the dark atmosphere...

    I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.

    I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich&eacute;s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film. But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us. The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other  interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.

    A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed. In post-war Vienna  a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces  pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice. The character of Harry Lime  though barely in the film at all  looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score  one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man  it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.

    With its remarkable use of atmospheric tension, good enough performances, cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking, The Third Man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar Vienna. It's a tale about a novelist, Holly Martins, trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place. Nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of Vienna being the show-stealers, this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited. An immersive thriller with a memorable climax, & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings, The Third Man is definitely worth your time.

    Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy. The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh  is anybody going over the edge? A mention must be made of the music  it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf&eacute; accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror. The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting  we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as  it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers  a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.

    Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead  I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.

    Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10
