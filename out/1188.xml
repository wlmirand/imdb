    Across a span of decades, the character of Billy the Kid has been portrayed in film by quite the eclectic group of well known actors - Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe and even Paul Newman in an early film role, "The Left Handed Gun". I'm repeating myself from other reviews I've written when I say that for my money, Emilio Estevez does the best job of bringing Billy the Kid to life on the big screen. He just has this ego-maniacal way of portraying The Kid's malice, but with a charisma that's kind of appealing when he's taking it to his enemies. "Young Guns II" isn't a great picture, but it's generally a fine follow up to the original "Young Guns", seeing as how a sequel was going to be made to capitalize on the first. I liked the idea of book-ending the story with the Brushy Bill Roberts appearance to add a bit of a mystique to the legend. I'll have to read up some more about that whole piece of history, since it's not that well known. I only came to learn about it when I saw this picture the first time back in the Nineties. I guess it's an interesting controversy to get wrapped up in, but I'm not that invested in the idea to get all worked up about it. What I liked about the story was the way it brought in some of the historical nuance to the legend of Billy. The Kid made it a point to say that the Lincoln County War was a merchant war, not a range war. It had all to do with commerce and the awarding of government contracts to supply beef to the Army. There was also the mention of the other names Billy used throughout his life. William Henry McCarty, was Billy's birth name, and he used the name of a step-father, William Antrim as well, though not often. In fact, Billy used a number of aliases throughout his outlaw career, presumably to conceal his true identity while on the run; William H. Bonney is the name that survives history the most memorably. Returning for the sequel in notable support roles are Kiefer Sutherland as 'Doc' Spurlock, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the Mexican-Indian Chavez. I wasn't particularly fond of William Petersen's casting as Sheriff Pat Garret, he didn't seem gritty enough in the role to take on the assignment from the Governor. Lew Wallace by the way, in real life was also the author of 'Ben-Hur', an interesting bit of trivia that totally astounded me when I found out he had a history with Billy The Kid as governor of New Mexico. As with most of these Hollywood treatments based on history, purists will take issue with the fictional elements thrown in to make the story engaging for a modern audience. If you can get beyond that, this one is entertaining enough for Western fans with some catchy dialog and skilled cinematography. As an added bonus, you have James Coburn in a neat cameo, and Jane Wright with that slinky Lady Godiva bit as she mounts up and heads out of White Oaks. I hope it wasn't too cold that day.

    I don't know why this movie has a 6.1 rating. This movie is a classic. The acting is great the story is classic. If you like westerns this is the movie for you. Twist and turns keep you involved. The only downside is that you are not Billy the Kid. As a child every one wished that they were the bad ass cowboy. This movie brings you there and answers your dream. Life, love, violence, sex, destiny, betrayal is all in this story. It is in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It it second to my favorite movie "Last Man on Earth". I am not a huge fan of westerns but this is my top ten movies. Emilio should have won an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

    I have to say Young Guns (the original) was a better movie based more on the facts about the life of Billy The Kid. However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor. Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger. Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter/ Charles Manson act by writing "Garrett's Place" in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics. So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

    This movie can't even be classified as a "Western". Emilio Estevez was not convincing. Then, we were subjected to viewing his naked butt. The guy is just not a good actor...Then, someone is always calling after him...."Beellaaay...Beellaaay..." Not, Billy; Beellaaay. Puhleeze. Then, there's the part where Lou Diamond Phillips' character gets stabbed right through his forearm. Can you imagine the pain and bone breakage associated with such an injury? The severed nerves, tendons..the inevitable infection? Nope. The knife was simply pulled out without so much as a wince. Then, he's just fine in the next scene, as if nothing had happened. Nobody was convincing in this film. It just seemed like a bunch of short Hollywood types hamming it up.

    This is the sequel to successful film titled 'Young Guns'(1998 , by Christopher Cain) with similar players and concerning about Billy and his band heading toward the Old Mexico and pursued by a posse. Revisionist and contemporary study about William Bonney, alias Billy the Kid . Billy(Emilio Estevez) became a cowboy in Lincoln County (New Mexico) for cattleman Tunstall allied to Chisum (James Coburn) , but Tunstall is killed and started the Lincoln County war against Murphy as main enemy . Billy seeks revenge for his death and he converted an outlaw and nasty gunfighter with a price on his head . Then Billy along with a young group (Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Lou Diamond Phillips , Balthazar Getty) have their own ethic codes and undergo a criminal spree . The bunch is besieged but they went out firing his gun and made his escape . However , the Kid was caught and convicted of killing and sentenced to be hanged ; though shackled foot and hand , he managed to getaway from prison by shooting dead the deputies (Leon Rippy) guarding him. Pat Garret( William H Petersen), a former friend, was elected sheriff and set off in pursuit to capture him and on 1881 tracked at Fort Sumner and there shot him dead by surprise. It is said that Chisum was instrumental in making Billy the Kid an outlaw killer, he used his considerable influence in getting Garret elected Sheriff of Lincoln County in 1880 and it was Pat who hunted down and killed the young outlaw . Garret and his gang pull off a hot chase against the outlaws. Legend says that Billy murdered 21 men in his 21 years of life but is really thought to be much less. After Pat Garrett was not reelected sheriff of Lincoln County, however he was commissioned a captain in the Texas Rangers. On 19 February 1908 he was driving his buggy on a lonely desert road, he stepped down to urinate and was shot in the back by a hired killer. A man stood trial for the murder but was acquitted. Controversy still surrounds the end of Pat Garrett . This is an in interesting look about the known story of the West's greatest bandit. Contemporary-style Western with acceptable performances and professional direction by Geoff Murphy who creates some good action scenes. The Kid is well played ,though sometimes overacting , by Emilio Estevez, he plays as a likable, sympathetic, attractive young and favourite with girls. This passable Western packs lots of action, shootouts, and explosive violence . Taut excitement throughout, beautifully photographed and with spectacular bloodletting but realized with some flaws . The story is exactly like &uml;The young guns I&uml; with loads of noisy action and violence. The film gets spectacular shoot em'up , thrills , exciting horse pursuits ; it's entertaining , although nothing new but displays an ordinary pace and with no originality . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the fugitives . Colorful and great cinematography by Dean Semler. Modern and unfitting musical score by Alan Silvestri with songs by Jon Bon Jovi. The motion picture will appeal to Western fans.

    Don't get me wrong I like the Good,Bad and the Ugly, The Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma and all the classic westerns, but this movie is different. It' s a movie with heart and an incredible moral value, and it has a lot of funny moments too. You can't run to the end of the time, once you have to face things, and you must have loyalty toward your friends. I have seen it like 5 times, but I enjoy it every time. It has a great soundtrack, the compositor did a great job. Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's far better than the first one. I hope one day will be a third part, till than I will see the second part over and over again.

    After the end of the Lincoln County War a new governor comes to town - one gen. Lee Wallace. He is here to bring order back to the region and plans on doing so by hanging whoever was connected to the war (nevermind what history tells us). Amongst those captured are Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips). Meanwhile Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is roaming the state rustling and hustling. Even tries to get pardon from the new governor, only to be tricked and put in jail. Billy soon manages to escape and breaks out his old pals with him. Together with some new pals like Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) and Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) the come back as the scourge of Lincoln County. But this time a former friend and ally Pat Garrett is hired as the new sheriff... When taking on this movie Emilio Estevez stated it would be closer to historical fact and more gritty. And I would have to say he lied. As far as the original part took some historical liberties this one just rapes them. Naturally some of the changes made in the first part had repercussions in the follow-up (like the death of Charles Bowdre), but I find no logic behind recasting Sutherland and Phillips in the follow-up and even less in them being killed off (given that both Chavez and Scurlock actually had relatively long lives for gunslingers). The main problem with the movie isn't however the history, but the general tone, which basically attempts to make a cool western. Characters are supposed to be savvy, funny and fun, while none of the grit of western movies makes it to the forefront. The whole Billy the Kid character is very poorly thought out by Estevez and his portrayal is one of the weakest. The movie (as in the first part) lacks heart and plods out from beginning to end with no real attempt to entice and engage. The biggest flaw is the lack of a proper counterpoint to Billy's character, someone who would put sense to his actions. There are a few brief scenes, which attempt to do this, but neither Pat Garrett or Doc Scurlock are given good enough lines to actually be able to pull it off. Instead the scenes just dissipate without any dramatic consequence. Given that the action is also not worth of any note it is not surprising that the movie has not stood the test of time and is slowing dropping into oblivion. Nonetheless the movie does have a brilliant score, although I did find myself wondering at times if it actually fits a western.

    The follow up to "Young Guns" is just as entertaining, if nothing more. As for accuracy look elsewhere, because this quick draw teenage (looking to be hip) aimed western is a passable gung-ho outing by director Geoff Murphy. It's not tough, but it's buoyant. One thing I noticed more was the comical angle being in full force with a lot of smarting quips and the blaring image of seeking fame or making a name for yourself as it seems to take priority over ones own life. All glory, little else in seeking to make a name to go down in history. Even Jon Bon Jovi chips away with his tune "Blaze of Glory" and contributes to most of the scorching rock soundtrack. The performances are variably delivered in a dead serious or sardonically cheeky manner. The likes Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and the lively Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid return. Estevez dons on some make-up to age him, which only looks ridiculous and so is his croaky narration running through the feature. Some new faces with Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Viggo Mortensen and William Petersen's steely conviction giving the best performance of the lot as Pat Garrett. When he takes up the offer to hunt down Billy, there's something imposing about Petersen's figure dressed in black and those glazed eyes. Also you got small parts from Tracey Walter and James Coburn (who played Garratt in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) to chew on his lines to quickly spit them out. Murphy does a stylish job delivering on theatrically set-up gunfights and adding some scope to his craftsmanship. Outside the witty exchanges, there are also plenty of spirited visual gags too. I didn't mind the humour and found it rather fitting.

    Young Guns II takes up a year later from the original movie. Billy has become a Hunted Legend and the government is determined to put the mess called the Lincoln County war behind them by burying the surviving regulators. Billy has formed a new gang with Arkansas Dave Rutabag and Pat Garrett a man who is perhaps Billy's closest friend. When Word reaches him that the New Governor General Lou Wallace is willing to pardon the kid for his crimes if he testfies about the events of the Lincoln county War. Billy doesn't know but Wallace has already rounded up all of his old friends and put them in a pit they're waiting for Billy to join them then they'll all be put to death. Billy goes and uncannily escapes death frees his friends and begins a New war this time against anybody whose against him. Pat Garrett superbly played by CSI's William Peterson provides maybe one of the films best performances he's watchable and his Pat Garrett is sympathetic to Billy but he's not immune to the madness Billy brings with him. All Garrett wants is to be at peace retire and open a eatery until The Government and Wallace and John Chisum persude Garrett to their way of thinking that it would be more of a mercy if Billy was killed by a friend who actually loves him then a faceless Executioner. The Film Explores Billy's final months and delivers a heart pounding finale that will leave you wondering after the film ends.

    Young Guns 2: Part 2, is as much an ensemble piece as the first film was. Survivors from the first film (Shat Pack favourites- Charlie 'Mr' Sheen, Ann Diamond Phillips, Emilio 'I wish I was Michael J Fox' Extevez, and Keifer 'Lost Boy' Southland) come together again with a host of new pups including Jonathan Bon Jovi, Chuck Norris, Muslim Slater, and Conrad Dorito. The plot follows the gang coming together again after the exploits of the first film- they have all been on the run from legendary law man Wyatt Ear who believes they are responsible for several murders and atrocities. Since the first film most have gone their separate ways. Billy The Boy has been rampaging through Texas robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, then killing the poor, and eating the rich. Doc has been on holiday in Mexico, has got himself a gal and spends his days making poetry, his night making sweet love. Neil Diamond Philips has been off on some sort of Spirit Guide affair, finding his inner Peyote and living in peace. They realise though that White Herpy is getting close and absolutely will not stop, ever, until they are dead. Or arrested. They need to ride once more, not Runaway, they may go down in a Blaze of Glory, but at least Someday they'll be Saturday night. This film is basically a remake of the first, albeit with a new plot and characters. It teaches you a lot about the Cowboys that used to roam about England before it was renamed America. There are shoot outs, drinking, women, and horses- everything you would expect in a good Western/Blue movie. We learn that Jimmy The Kid is actually one of the few remaining Demi-Mortals- humans who age anything from 2 to ten times slower than the rest of us. Whether or not this has been proved to be historically true is open for debate as no body was ever found and some claim to see him giggling and jumping through their wheat fields at night while they sit on their porch rocking chair sipping Sasparella. Best Scene: When they are trapped with their backs to the wall and decide to charge out firing their guns in slow motion as the picture fades to sepia, and Living On A Prayer plays in the background. It makes me wish I was a Cowman and roam the desert shooting hippies!

This passable Western packs lots of action, shootouts, and explosive violence . Taut excitement throughout, beautifully photographed and with spectacular bloodletting but realized with some flaws . The story is exactly like &uml;The young guns I&uml; with loads of noisy action and violence. The film gets spectacular shoot em'up , thrills , exciting horse pursuits ; it's entertaining , although nothing new but displays an ordinary pace and with no originality . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the fugitives . Colorful and great cinematography by Dean Semler.

    Don't get me wrong I like the Good,Bad and the Ugly, The Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma and all the classic westerns, but this movie is different. It' s a movie with heart and an incredible moral value, and it has a lot of funny moments too. You can't run to the end of the time, once you have to face things, and you must have loyalty toward your friends. I have seen it like 5 times, but I enjoy it every time. It has a great soundtrack, the compositor did a great job. Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's far better than the first one. I hope one day will be a third part, till than I will see the second part over and over again.

    After the end of the Lincoln County War a new governor comes to town - one gen. Lee Wallace. He is here to bring order back to the region and plans on doing so by hanging whoever was connected to the war (nevermind what history tells us). Amongst those captured are Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips). Meanwhile Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is roaming the state rustling and hustling. Even tries to get pardon from the new governor, only to be tricked and put in jail. Billy soon manages to escape and breaks out his old pals with him. Together with some new pals like Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) and Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) the come back as the scourge of Lincoln County. But this time a former friend and ally Pat Garrett is hired as the new sheriff... When taking on this movie Emilio Estevez stated it would be closer to historical fact and more gritty. And I would have to say he lied. As far as the original part took some historical liberties this one just rapes them. Naturally some of the changes made in the first part had repercussions in the follow-up (like the death of Charles Bowdre), but I find no logic behind recasting Sutherland and Phillips in the follow-up and even less in them being killed off (given that both Chavez and Scurlock actually had relatively long lives for gunslingers). The main problem with the movie isn't however the history, but the general tone, which basically attempts to make a cool western. Characters are supposed to be savvy, funny and fun, while none of the grit of western movies makes it to the forefront. The whole Billy the Kid character is very poorly thought out by Estevez and his portrayal is one of the weakest. The movie (as in the first part) lacks heart and plods out from beginning to end with no real attempt to entice and engage. The biggest flaw is the lack of a proper counterpoint to Billy's character, someone who would put sense to his actions. There are a few brief scenes, which attempt to do this, but neither Pat Garrett or Doc Scurlock are given good enough lines to actually be able to pull it off. Instead the scenes just dissipate without any dramatic consequence. Given that the action is also not worth of any note it is not surprising that the movie has not stood the test of time and is slowing dropping into oblivion. Nonetheless the movie does have a brilliant score, although I did find myself wondering at times if it actually fits a western.

    The follow up to "Young Guns" is just as entertaining, if nothing more. As for accuracy look elsewhere, because this quick draw teenage (looking to be hip) aimed western is a passable gung-ho outing by director Geoff Murphy. It's not tough, but it's buoyant. One thing I noticed more was the comical angle being in full force with a lot of smarting quips and the blaring image of seeking fame or making a name for yourself as it seems to take priority over ones own life. All glory, little else in seeking to make a name to go down in history. Even Jon Bon Jovi chips away with his tune "Blaze of Glory" and contributes to most of the scorching rock soundtrack. The performances are variably delivered in a dead serious or sardonically cheeky manner. The likes Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and the lively Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid return. Estevez dons on some make-up to age him, which only looks ridiculous and so is his croaky narration running through the feature. Some new faces with Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Viggo Mortensen and William Petersen's steely conviction giving the best performance of the lot as Pat Garrett. When he takes up the offer to hunt down Billy, there's something imposing about Petersen's figure dressed in black and those glazed eyes. Also you got small parts from Tracey Walter and James Coburn (who played Garratt in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) to chew on his lines to quickly spit them out. Murphy does a stylish job delivering on theatrically set-up gunfights and adding some scope to his craftsmanship. Outside the witty exchanges, there are also plenty of spirited visual gags too. I didn't mind the humour and found it rather fitting.

    Young Guns II takes up a year later from the original movie. Billy has become a Hunted Legend and the government is determined to put the mess called the Lincoln County war behind them by burying the surviving regulators. Billy has formed a new gang with Arkansas Dave Rutabag and Pat Garrett a man who is perhaps Billy's closest friend. When Word reaches him that the New Governor General Lou Wallace is willing to pardon the kid for his crimes if he testfies about the events of the Lincoln county War. Billy doesn't know but Wallace has already rounded up all of his old friends and put them in a pit they're waiting for Billy to join them then they'll all be put to death. Billy goes and uncannily escapes death frees his friends and begins a New war this time against anybody whose against him. Pat Garrett superbly played by CSI's William Peterson provides maybe one of the films best performances he's watchable and his Pat Garrett is sympathetic to Billy but he's not immune to the madness Billy brings with him. All Garrett wants is to be at peace retire and open a eatery until The Government and Wallace and John Chisum persude Garrett to their way of thinking that it would be more of a mercy if Billy was killed by a friend who actually loves him then a faceless Executioner. The Film Explores Billy's final months and delivers a heart pounding finale that will leave you wondering after the film ends.

    Young Guns 2: Part 2, is as much an ensemble piece as the first film was. Survivors from the first film (Shat Pack favourites- Charlie 'Mr' Sheen, Ann Diamond Phillips, Emilio 'I wish I was Michael J Fox' Extevez, and Keifer 'Lost Boy' Southland) come together again with a host of new pups including Jonathan Bon Jovi, Chuck Norris, Muslim Slater, and Conrad Dorito. The plot follows the gang coming together again after the exploits of the first film- they have all been on the run from legendary law man Wyatt Ear who believes they are responsible for several murders and atrocities. Since the first film most have gone their separate ways. Billy The Boy has been rampaging through Texas robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, then killing the poor, and eating the rich. Doc has been on holiday in Mexico, has got himself a gal and spends his days making poetry, his night making sweet love. Neil Diamond Philips has been off on some sort of Spirit Guide affair, finding his inner Peyote and living in peace. They realise though that White Herpy is getting close and absolutely will not stop, ever, until they are dead. Or arrested. They need to ride once more, not Runaway, they may go down in a Blaze of Glory, but at least Someday they'll be Saturday night. This film is basically a remake of the first, albeit with a new plot and characters. It teaches you a lot about the Cowboys that used to roam about England before it was renamed America. There are shoot outs, drinking, women, and horses- everything you would expect in a good Western/Blue movie. We learn that Jimmy The Kid is actually one of the few remaining Demi-Mortals- humans who age anything from 2 to ten times slower than the rest of us. Whether or not this has been proved to be historically true is open for debate as no body was ever found and some claim to see him giggling and jumping through their wheat fields at night while they sit on their porch rocking chair sipping Sasparella. Best Scene: When they are trapped with their backs to the wall and decide to charge out firing their guns in slow motion as the picture fades to sepia, and Living On A Prayer plays in the background. It makes me wish I was a Cowman and roam the desert shooting hippies!

    Across a span of decades, the character of Billy the Kid has been portrayed in film by quite the eclectic group of well known actors - Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe and even Paul Newman in an early film role, "The Left Handed Gun". I'm repeating myself from other reviews I've written when I say that for my money, Emilio Estevez does the best job of bringing Billy the Kid to life on the big screen. He just has this ego-maniacal way of portraying The Kid's malice, but with a charisma that's kind of appealing when he's taking it to his enemies. "Young Guns II" isn't a great picture, but it's generally a fine follow up to the original "Young Guns", seeing as how a sequel was going to be made to capitalize on the first. I liked the idea of book-ending the story with the Brushy Bill Roberts appearance to add a bit of a mystique to the legend. I'll have to read up some more about that whole piece of history, since it's not that well known. I only came to learn about it when I saw this picture the first time back in the Nineties. I guess it's an interesting controversy to get wrapped up in, but I'm not that invested in the idea to get all worked up about it. What I liked about the story was the way it brought in some of the historical nuance to the legend of Billy. The Kid made it a point to say that the Lincoln County War was a merchant war, not a range war. It had all to do with commerce and the awarding of government contracts to supply beef to the Army. There was also the mention of the other names Billy used throughout his life. William Henry McCarty, was Billy's birth name, and he used the name of a step-father, William Antrim as well, though not often. In fact, Billy used a number of aliases throughout his outlaw career, presumably to conceal his true identity while on the run; William H. Bonney is the name that survives history the most memorably. Returning for the sequel in notable support roles are Kiefer Sutherland as 'Doc' Spurlock, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the Mexican-Indian Chavez. I wasn't particularly fond of William Petersen's casting as Sheriff Pat Garret, he didn't seem gritty enough in the role to take on the assignment from the Governor. Lew Wallace by the way, in real life was also the author of 'Ben-Hur', an interesting bit of trivia that totally astounded me when I found out he had a history with Billy The Kid as governor of New Mexico. As with most of these Hollywood treatments based on history, purists will take issue with the fictional elements thrown in to make the story engaging for a modern audience. If you can get beyond that, this one is entertaining enough for Western fans with some catchy dialog and skilled cinematography. As an added bonus, you have James Coburn in a neat cameo, and Jane Wright with that slinky Lady Godiva bit as she mounts up and heads out of White Oaks. I hope it wasn't too cold that day.

    I don't know why this movie has a 6.1 rating. This movie is a classic. The acting is great the story is classic. If you like westerns this is the movie for you. Twist and turns keep you involved. The only downside is that you are not Billy the Kid. As a child every one wished that they were the bad ass cowboy. This movie brings you there and answers your dream. Life, love, violence, sex, destiny, betrayal is all in this story. It is in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It it second to my favorite movie "Last Man on Earth". I am not a huge fan of westerns but this is my top ten movies. Emilio should have won an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

    I have to say Young Guns (the original) was a better movie based more on the facts about the life of Billy The Kid. However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor. Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger. Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter/ Charles Manson act by writing "Garrett's Place" in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics. So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

    This movie can't even be classified as a "Western". Emilio Estevez was not convincing. Then, we were subjected to viewing his naked butt. The guy is just not a good actor...Then, someone is always calling after him...."Beellaaay...Beellaaay..." Not, Billy; Beellaaay. Puhleeze. Then, there's the part where Lou Diamond Phillips' character gets stabbed right through his forearm. Can you imagine the pain and bone breakage associated with such an injury? The severed nerves, tendons..the inevitable infection? Nope. The knife was simply pulled out without so much as a wince. Then, he's just fine in the next scene, as if nothing had happened. Nobody was convincing in this film. It just seemed like a bunch of short Hollywood types hamming it up.

The plot follows the gang coming together again after the exploits of the first film- they have all been on the run from legendary law man Wyatt Ear who believes they are responsible for several murders and atrocities. Since the first film most have gone their separate ways. Billy The Boy has been rampaging through Texas robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, then killing the poor, and eating the rich. Doc has been on holiday in Mexico, has got himself a gal and spends his days making poetry, his night making sweet love. Neil Diamond Philips has been off on some sort of Spirit Guide affair, finding his inner Peyote and living in peace. They realise though that White Herpy is getting close and absolutely will not stop, ever, until they are dead. Or arrested. They need to ride once more, not Runaway, they may go down in a Blaze of Glory, but at least Someday they'll be Saturday night. This film is basically a remake of the first, albeit with a new plot and characters. It teaches you a lot about the Cowboys that used to roam about England before it was renamed America. There are shoot outs, drinking, women, and horses- everything you would expect in a good Western/Blue movie. We learn that Jimmy The Kid is actually one of the few remaining Demi-Mortals- humans who age anything from 2 to ten times slower than the rest of us. Whether or not this has been proved to be historically true is open for debate as no body was ever found and some claim to see him giggling and jumping through their wheat fields at night while they sit on their porch rocking chair sipping Sasparella. Best Scene: When they are trapped with their backs to the wall and decide to charge out firing their guns in slow motion as the picture fades to sepia, and Living On A Prayer plays in the background. It makes me wish I was a Cowman and roam the desert shooting hippies!

    Across a span of decades, the character of Billy the Kid has been portrayed in film by quite the eclectic group of well known actors - Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe and even Paul Newman in an early film role, "The Left Handed Gun". I'm repeating myself from other reviews I've written when I say that for my money, Emilio Estevez does the best job of bringing Billy the Kid to life on the big screen. He just has this ego-maniacal way of portraying The Kid's malice, but with a charisma that's kind of appealing when he's taking it to his enemies. "Young Guns II" isn't a great picture, but it's generally a fine follow up to the original "Young Guns", seeing as how a sequel was going to be made to capitalize on the first. I liked the idea of book-ending the story with the Brushy Bill Roberts appearance to add a bit of a mystique to the legend. I'll have to read up some more about that whole piece of history, since it's not that well known. I only came to learn about it when I saw this picture the first time back in the Nineties. I guess it's an interesting controversy to get wrapped up in, but I'm not that invested in the idea to get all worked up about it. What I liked about the story was the way it brought in some of the historical nuance to the legend of Billy. The Kid made it a point to say that the Lincoln County War was a merchant war, not a range war. It had all to do with commerce and the awarding of government contracts to supply beef to the Army. There was also the mention of the other names Billy used throughout his life. William Henry McCarty, was Billy's birth name, and he used the name of a step-father, William Antrim as well, though not often. In fact, Billy used a number of aliases throughout his outlaw career, presumably to conceal his true identity while on the run; William H. Bonney is the name that survives history the most memorably. Returning for the sequel in notable support roles are Kiefer Sutherland as 'Doc' Spurlock, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the Mexican-Indian Chavez. I wasn't particularly fond of William Petersen's casting as Sheriff Pat Garret, he didn't seem gritty enough in the role to take on the assignment from the Governor. Lew Wallace by the way, in real life was also the author of 'Ben-Hur', an interesting bit of trivia that totally astounded me when I found out he had a history with Billy The Kid as governor of New Mexico. As with most of these Hollywood treatments based on history, purists will take issue with the fictional elements thrown in to make the story engaging for a modern audience. If you can get beyond that, this one is entertaining enough for Western fans with some catchy dialog and skilled cinematography. As an added bonus, you have James Coburn in a neat cameo, and Jane Wright with that slinky Lady Godiva bit as she mounts up and heads out of White Oaks. I hope it wasn't too cold that day.

    I don't know why this movie has a 6.1 rating. This movie is a classic. The acting is great the story is classic. If you like westerns this is the movie for you. Twist and turns keep you involved. The only downside is that you are not Billy the Kid. As a child every one wished that they were the bad ass cowboy. This movie brings you there and answers your dream. Life, love, violence, sex, destiny, betrayal is all in this story. It is in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It it second to my favorite movie "Last Man on Earth". I am not a huge fan of westerns but this is my top ten movies. Emilio should have won an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

    I have to say Young Guns (the original) was a better movie based more on the facts about the life of Billy The Kid. However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor. Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger. Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter/ Charles Manson act by writing "Garrett's Place" in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics. So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

    This movie can't even be classified as a "Western". Emilio Estevez was not convincing. Then, we were subjected to viewing his naked butt. The guy is just not a good actor...Then, someone is always calling after him...."Beellaaay...Beellaaay..." Not, Billy; Beellaaay. Puhleeze. Then, there's the part where Lou Diamond Phillips' character gets stabbed right through his forearm. Can you imagine the pain and bone breakage associated with such an injury? The severed nerves, tendons..the inevitable infection? Nope. The knife was simply pulled out without so much as a wince. Then, he's just fine in the next scene, as if nothing had happened. Nobody was convincing in this film. It just seemed like a bunch of short Hollywood types hamming it up.

    This is the sequel to successful film titled 'Young Guns'(1998 , by Christopher Cain) with similar players and concerning about Billy and his band heading toward the Old Mexico and pursued by a posse. Revisionist and contemporary study about William Bonney, alias Billy the Kid . Billy(Emilio Estevez) became a cowboy in Lincoln County (New Mexico) for cattleman Tunstall allied to Chisum (James Coburn) , but Tunstall is killed and started the Lincoln County war against Murphy as main enemy . Billy seeks revenge for his death and he converted an outlaw and nasty gunfighter with a price on his head . Then Billy along with a young group (Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Lou Diamond Phillips , Balthazar Getty) have their own ethic codes and undergo a criminal spree . The bunch is besieged but they went out firing his gun and made his escape . However , the Kid was caught and convicted of killing and sentenced to be hanged ; though shackled foot and hand , he managed to getaway from prison by shooting dead the deputies (Leon Rippy) guarding him. Pat Garret( William H Petersen), a former friend, was elected sheriff and set off in pursuit to capture him and on 1881 tracked at Fort Sumner and there shot him dead by surprise. It is said that Chisum was instrumental in making Billy the Kid an outlaw killer, he used his considerable influence in getting Garret elected Sheriff of Lincoln County in 1880 and it was Pat who hunted down and killed the young outlaw . Garret and his gang pull off a hot chase against the outlaws. Legend says that Billy murdered 21 men in his 21 years of life but is really thought to be much less. After Pat Garrett was not reelected sheriff of Lincoln County, however he was commissioned a captain in the Texas Rangers. On 19 February 1908 he was driving his buggy on a lonely desert road, he stepped down to urinate and was shot in the back by a hired killer. A man stood trial for the murder but was acquitted. Controversy still surrounds the end of Pat Garrett . This is an in interesting look about the known story of the West's greatest bandit. Contemporary-style Western with acceptable performances and professional direction by Geoff Murphy who creates some good action scenes. The Kid is well played ,though sometimes overacting , by Emilio Estevez, he plays as a likable, sympathetic, attractive young and favourite with girls. This passable Western packs lots of action, shootouts, and explosive violence . Taut excitement throughout, beautifully photographed and with spectacular bloodletting but realized with some flaws . The story is exactly like &uml;The young guns I&uml; with loads of noisy action and violence. The film gets spectacular shoot em'up , thrills , exciting horse pursuits ; it's entertaining , although nothing new but displays an ordinary pace and with no originality . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the fugitives . Colorful and great cinematography by Dean Semler. Modern and unfitting musical score by Alan Silvestri with songs by Jon Bon Jovi. The motion picture will appeal to Western fans.

    Don't get me wrong I like the Good,Bad and the Ugly, The Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma and all the classic westerns, but this movie is different. It' s a movie with heart and an incredible moral value, and it has a lot of funny moments too. You can't run to the end of the time, once you have to face things, and you must have loyalty toward your friends. I have seen it like 5 times, but I enjoy it every time. It has a great soundtrack, the compositor did a great job. Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's far better than the first one. I hope one day will be a third part, till than I will see the second part over and over again.

    After the end of the Lincoln County War a new governor comes to town - one gen. Lee Wallace. He is here to bring order back to the region and plans on doing so by hanging whoever was connected to the war (nevermind what history tells us). Amongst those captured are Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips). Meanwhile Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is roaming the state rustling and hustling. Even tries to get pardon from the new governor, only to be tricked and put in jail. Billy soon manages to escape and breaks out his old pals with him. Together with some new pals like Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) and Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) the come back as the scourge of Lincoln County. But this time a former friend and ally Pat Garrett is hired as the new sheriff... When taking on this movie Emilio Estevez stated it would be closer to historical fact and more gritty. And I would have to say he lied. As far as the original part took some historical liberties this one just rapes them. Naturally some of the changes made in the first part had repercussions in the follow-up (like the death of Charles Bowdre), but I find no logic behind recasting Sutherland and Phillips in the follow-up and even less in them being killed off (given that both Chavez and Scurlock actually had relatively long lives for gunslingers). The main problem with the movie isn't however the history, but the general tone, which basically attempts to make a cool western. Characters are supposed to be savvy, funny and fun, while none of the grit of western movies makes it to the forefront. The whole Billy the Kid character is very poorly thought out by Estevez and his portrayal is one of the weakest. The movie (as in the first part) lacks heart and plods out from beginning to end with no real attempt to entice and engage. The biggest flaw is the lack of a proper counterpoint to Billy's character, someone who would put sense to his actions. There are a few brief scenes, which attempt to do this, but neither Pat Garrett or Doc Scurlock are given good enough lines to actually be able to pull it off. Instead the scenes just dissipate without any dramatic consequence. Given that the action is also not worth of any note it is not surprising that the movie has not stood the test of time and is slowing dropping into oblivion. Nonetheless the movie does have a brilliant score, although I did find myself wondering at times if it actually fits a western.

    The follow up to "Young Guns" is just as entertaining, if nothing more. As for accuracy look elsewhere, because this quick draw teenage (looking to be hip) aimed western is a passable gung-ho outing by director Geoff Murphy. It's not tough, but it's buoyant. One thing I noticed more was the comical angle being in full force with a lot of smarting quips and the blaring image of seeking fame or making a name for yourself as it seems to take priority over ones own life. All glory, little else in seeking to make a name to go down in history. Even Jon Bon Jovi chips away with his tune "Blaze of Glory" and contributes to most of the scorching rock soundtrack. The performances are variably delivered in a dead serious or sardonically cheeky manner. The likes Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and the lively Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid return. Estevez dons on some make-up to age him, which only looks ridiculous and so is his croaky narration running through the feature. Some new faces with Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Viggo Mortensen and William Petersen's steely conviction giving the best performance of the lot as Pat Garrett. When he takes up the offer to hunt down Billy, there's something imposing about Petersen's figure dressed in black and those glazed eyes. Also you got small parts from Tracey Walter and James Coburn (who played Garratt in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) to chew on his lines to quickly spit them out. Murphy does a stylish job delivering on theatrically set-up gunfights and adding some scope to his craftsmanship. Outside the witty exchanges, there are also plenty of spirited visual gags too. I didn't mind the humour and found it rather fitting.

    Young Guns II takes up a year later from the original movie. Billy has become a Hunted Legend and the government is determined to put the mess called the Lincoln County war behind them by burying the surviving regulators. Billy has formed a new gang with Arkansas Dave Rutabag and Pat Garrett a man who is perhaps Billy's closest friend. When Word reaches him that the New Governor General Lou Wallace is willing to pardon the kid for his crimes if he testfies about the events of the Lincoln county War. Billy doesn't know but Wallace has already rounded up all of his old friends and put them in a pit they're waiting for Billy to join them then they'll all be put to death. Billy goes and uncannily escapes death frees his friends and begins a New war this time against anybody whose against him. Pat Garrett superbly played by CSI's William Peterson provides maybe one of the films best performances he's watchable and his Pat Garrett is sympathetic to Billy but he's not immune to the madness Billy brings with him. All Garrett wants is to be at peace retire and open a eatery until The Government and Wallace and John Chisum persude Garrett to their way of thinking that it would be more of a mercy if Billy was killed by a friend who actually loves him then a faceless Executioner. The Film Explores Billy's final months and delivers a heart pounding finale that will leave you wondering after the film ends.

    Don't get me wrong I like the Good,Bad and the Ugly, The Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma and all the classic westerns, but this movie is different. It' s a movie with heart and an incredible moral value, and it has a lot of funny moments too. You can't run to the end of the time, once you have to face things, and you must have loyalty toward your friends. I have seen it like 5 times, but I enjoy it every time. It has a great soundtrack, the compositor did a great job. Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's far better than the first one. I hope one day will be a third part, till than I will see the second part over and over again.

    After the end of the Lincoln County War a new governor comes to town - one gen. Lee Wallace. He is here to bring order back to the region and plans on doing so by hanging whoever was connected to the war (nevermind what history tells us). Amongst those captured are Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips). Meanwhile Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is roaming the state rustling and hustling. Even tries to get pardon from the new governor, only to be tricked and put in jail. Billy soon manages to escape and breaks out his old pals with him. Together with some new pals like Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) and Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) the come back as the scourge of Lincoln County. But this time a former friend and ally Pat Garrett is hired as the new sheriff... When taking on this movie Emilio Estevez stated it would be closer to historical fact and more gritty. And I would have to say he lied. As far as the original part took some historical liberties this one just rapes them. Naturally some of the changes made in the first part had repercussions in the follow-up (like the death of Charles Bowdre), but I find no logic behind recasting Sutherland and Phillips in the follow-up and even less in them being killed off (given that both Chavez and Scurlock actually had relatively long lives for gunslingers). The main problem with the movie isn't however the history, but the general tone, which basically attempts to make a cool western. Characters are supposed to be savvy, funny and fun, while none of the grit of western movies makes it to the forefront. The whole Billy the Kid character is very poorly thought out by Estevez and his portrayal is one of the weakest. The movie (as in the first part) lacks heart and plods out from beginning to end with no real attempt to entice and engage. The biggest flaw is the lack of a proper counterpoint to Billy's character, someone who would put sense to his actions. There are a few brief scenes, which attempt to do this, but neither Pat Garrett or Doc Scurlock are given good enough lines to actually be able to pull it off. Instead the scenes just dissipate without any dramatic consequence. Given that the action is also not worth of any note it is not surprising that the movie has not stood the test of time and is slowing dropping into oblivion. Nonetheless the movie does have a brilliant score, although I did find myself wondering at times if it actually fits a western.

    The follow up to "Young Guns" is just as entertaining, if nothing more. As for accuracy look elsewhere, because this quick draw teenage (looking to be hip) aimed western is a passable gung-ho outing by director Geoff Murphy. It's not tough, but it's buoyant. One thing I noticed more was the comical angle being in full force with a lot of smarting quips and the blaring image of seeking fame or making a name for yourself as it seems to take priority over ones own life. All glory, little else in seeking to make a name to go down in history. Even Jon Bon Jovi chips away with his tune "Blaze of Glory" and contributes to most of the scorching rock soundtrack. The performances are variably delivered in a dead serious or sardonically cheeky manner. The likes Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and the lively Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid return. Estevez dons on some make-up to age him, which only looks ridiculous and so is his croaky narration running through the feature. Some new faces with Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Viggo Mortensen and William Petersen's steely conviction giving the best performance of the lot as Pat Garrett. When he takes up the offer to hunt down Billy, there's something imposing about Petersen's figure dressed in black and those glazed eyes. Also you got small parts from Tracey Walter and James Coburn (who played Garratt in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) to chew on his lines to quickly spit them out. Murphy does a stylish job delivering on theatrically set-up gunfights and adding some scope to his craftsmanship. Outside the witty exchanges, there are also plenty of spirited visual gags too. I didn't mind the humour and found it rather fitting.

    Young Guns II takes up a year later from the original movie. Billy has become a Hunted Legend and the government is determined to put the mess called the Lincoln County war behind them by burying the surviving regulators. Billy has formed a new gang with Arkansas Dave Rutabag and Pat Garrett a man who is perhaps Billy's closest friend. When Word reaches him that the New Governor General Lou Wallace is willing to pardon the kid for his crimes if he testfies about the events of the Lincoln county War. Billy doesn't know but Wallace has already rounded up all of his old friends and put them in a pit they're waiting for Billy to join them then they'll all be put to death. Billy goes and uncannily escapes death frees his friends and begins a New war this time against anybody whose against him. Pat Garrett superbly played by CSI's William Peterson provides maybe one of the films best performances he's watchable and his Pat Garrett is sympathetic to Billy but he's not immune to the madness Billy brings with him. All Garrett wants is to be at peace retire and open a eatery until The Government and Wallace and John Chisum persude Garrett to their way of thinking that it would be more of a mercy if Billy was killed by a friend who actually loves him then a faceless Executioner. The Film Explores Billy's final months and delivers a heart pounding finale that will leave you wondering after the film ends.

    Young Guns 2: Part 2, is as much an ensemble piece as the first film was. Survivors from the first film (Shat Pack favourites- Charlie 'Mr' Sheen, Ann Diamond Phillips, Emilio 'I wish I was Michael J Fox' Extevez, and Keifer 'Lost Boy' Southland) come together again with a host of new pups including Jonathan Bon Jovi, Chuck Norris, Muslim Slater, and Conrad Dorito. The plot follows the gang coming together again after the exploits of the first film- they have all been on the run from legendary law man Wyatt Ear who believes they are responsible for several murders and atrocities. Since the first film most have gone their separate ways. Billy The Boy has been rampaging through Texas robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, then killing the poor, and eating the rich. Doc has been on holiday in Mexico, has got himself a gal and spends his days making poetry, his night making sweet love. Neil Diamond Philips has been off on some sort of Spirit Guide affair, finding his inner Peyote and living in peace. They realise though that White Herpy is getting close and absolutely will not stop, ever, until they are dead. Or arrested. They need to ride once more, not Runaway, they may go down in a Blaze of Glory, but at least Someday they'll be Saturday night. This film is basically a remake of the first, albeit with a new plot and characters. It teaches you a lot about the Cowboys that used to roam about England before it was renamed America. There are shoot outs, drinking, women, and horses- everything you would expect in a good Western/Blue movie. We learn that Jimmy The Kid is actually one of the few remaining Demi-Mortals- humans who age anything from 2 to ten times slower than the rest of us. Whether or not this has been proved to be historically true is open for debate as no body was ever found and some claim to see him giggling and jumping through their wheat fields at night while they sit on their porch rocking chair sipping Sasparella. Best Scene: When they are trapped with their backs to the wall and decide to charge out firing their guns in slow motion as the picture fades to sepia, and Living On A Prayer plays in the background. It makes me wish I was a Cowman and roam the desert shooting hippies!

    Across a span of decades, the character of Billy the Kid has been portrayed in film by quite the eclectic group of well known actors - Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe and even Paul Newman in an early film role, "The Left Handed Gun". I'm repeating myself from other reviews I've written when I say that for my money, Emilio Estevez does the best job of bringing Billy the Kid to life on the big screen. He just has this ego-maniacal way of portraying The Kid's malice, but with a charisma that's kind of appealing when he's taking it to his enemies. "Young Guns II" isn't a great picture, but it's generally a fine follow up to the original "Young Guns", seeing as how a sequel was going to be made to capitalize on the first. I liked the idea of book-ending the story with the Brushy Bill Roberts appearance to add a bit of a mystique to the legend. I'll have to read up some more about that whole piece of history, since it's not that well known. I only came to learn about it when I saw this picture the first time back in the Nineties. I guess it's an interesting controversy to get wrapped up in, but I'm not that invested in the idea to get all worked up about it. What I liked about the story was the way it brought in some of the historical nuance to the legend of Billy. The Kid made it a point to say that the Lincoln County War was a merchant war, not a range war. It had all to do with commerce and the awarding of government contracts to supply beef to the Army. There was also the mention of the other names Billy used throughout his life. William Henry McCarty, was Billy's birth name, and he used the name of a step-father, William Antrim as well, though not often. In fact, Billy used a number of aliases throughout his outlaw career, presumably to conceal his true identity while on the run; William H. Bonney is the name that survives history the most memorably. Returning for the sequel in notable support roles are Kiefer Sutherland as 'Doc' Spurlock, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the Mexican-Indian Chavez. I wasn't particularly fond of William Petersen's casting as Sheriff Pat Garret, he didn't seem gritty enough in the role to take on the assignment from the Governor. Lew Wallace by the way, in real life was also the author of 'Ben-Hur', an interesting bit of trivia that totally astounded me when I found out he had a history with Billy The Kid as governor of New Mexico. As with most of these Hollywood treatments based on history, purists will take issue with the fictional elements thrown in to make the story engaging for a modern audience. If you can get beyond that, this one is entertaining enough for Western fans with some catchy dialog and skilled cinematography. As an added bonus, you have James Coburn in a neat cameo, and Jane Wright with that slinky Lady Godiva bit as she mounts up and heads out of White Oaks. I hope it wasn't too cold that day.

    I don't know why this movie has a 6.1 rating. This movie is a classic. The acting is great the story is classic. If you like westerns this is the movie for you. Twist and turns keep you involved. The only downside is that you are not Billy the Kid. As a child every one wished that they were the bad ass cowboy. This movie brings you there and answers your dream. Life, love, violence, sex, destiny, betrayal is all in this story. It is in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It it second to my favorite movie "Last Man on Earth". I am not a huge fan of westerns but this is my top ten movies. Emilio should have won an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

    I have to say Young Guns (the original) was a better movie based more on the facts about the life of Billy The Kid. However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor. Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger. Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter/ Charles Manson act by writing "Garrett's Place" in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics. So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

    This movie can't even be classified as a "Western". Emilio Estevez was not convincing. Then, we were subjected to viewing his naked butt. The guy is just not a good actor...Then, someone is always calling after him...."Beellaaay...Beellaaay..." Not, Billy; Beellaaay. Puhleeze. Then, there's the part where Lou Diamond Phillips' character gets stabbed right through his forearm. Can you imagine the pain and bone breakage associated with such an injury? The severed nerves, tendons..the inevitable infection? Nope. The knife was simply pulled out without so much as a wince. Then, he's just fine in the next scene, as if nothing had happened. Nobody was convincing in this film. It just seemed like a bunch of short Hollywood types hamming it up.

Since the first film most have gone their separate ways. Billy The Boy has been rampaging through Texas robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, then killing the poor, and eating the rich. Doc has been on holiday in Mexico, has got himself a gal and spends his days making poetry, his night making sweet love. Neil Diamond Philips has been off on some sort of Spirit Guide affair, finding his inner Peyote and living in peace. They realise though that White Herpy is getting close and absolutely will not stop, ever, until they are dead. Or arrested. They need to ride once more, not Runaway, they may go down in a Blaze of Glory, but at least Someday they'll be Saturday night. This film is basically a remake of the first, albeit with a new plot and characters. It teaches you a lot about the Cowboys that used to roam about England before it was renamed America. There are shoot outs, drinking, women, and horses- everything you would expect in a good Western/Blue movie. We learn that Jimmy The Kid is actually one of the few remaining Demi-Mortals- humans who age anything from 2 to ten times slower than the rest of us. Whether or not this has been proved to be historically true is open for debate as no body was ever found and some claim to see him giggling and jumping through their wheat fields at night while they sit on their porch rocking chair sipping Sasparella. Best Scene: When they are trapped with their backs to the wall and decide to charge out firing their guns in slow motion as the picture fades to sepia, and Living On A Prayer plays in the background. It makes me wish I was a Cowman and roam the desert shooting hippies!

    Across a span of decades, the character of Billy the Kid has been portrayed in film by quite the eclectic group of well known actors - Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe and even Paul Newman in an early film role, "The Left Handed Gun". I'm repeating myself from other reviews I've written when I say that for my money, Emilio Estevez does the best job of bringing Billy the Kid to life on the big screen. He just has this ego-maniacal way of portraying The Kid's malice, but with a charisma that's kind of appealing when he's taking it to his enemies. "Young Guns II" isn't a great picture, but it's generally a fine follow up to the original "Young Guns", seeing as how a sequel was going to be made to capitalize on the first. I liked the idea of book-ending the story with the Brushy Bill Roberts appearance to add a bit of a mystique to the legend. I'll have to read up some more about that whole piece of history, since it's not that well known. I only came to learn about it when I saw this picture the first time back in the Nineties. I guess it's an interesting controversy to get wrapped up in, but I'm not that invested in the idea to get all worked up about it. What I liked about the story was the way it brought in some of the historical nuance to the legend of Billy. The Kid made it a point to say that the Lincoln County War was a merchant war, not a range war. It had all to do with commerce and the awarding of government contracts to supply beef to the Army. There was also the mention of the other names Billy used throughout his life. William Henry McCarty, was Billy's birth name, and he used the name of a step-father, William Antrim as well, though not often. In fact, Billy used a number of aliases throughout his outlaw career, presumably to conceal his true identity while on the run; William H. Bonney is the name that survives history the most memorably. Returning for the sequel in notable support roles are Kiefer Sutherland as 'Doc' Spurlock, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the Mexican-Indian Chavez. I wasn't particularly fond of William Petersen's casting as Sheriff Pat Garret, he didn't seem gritty enough in the role to take on the assignment from the Governor. Lew Wallace by the way, in real life was also the author of 'Ben-Hur', an interesting bit of trivia that totally astounded me when I found out he had a history with Billy The Kid as governor of New Mexico. As with most of these Hollywood treatments based on history, purists will take issue with the fictional elements thrown in to make the story engaging for a modern audience. If you can get beyond that, this one is entertaining enough for Western fans with some catchy dialog and skilled cinematography. As an added bonus, you have James Coburn in a neat cameo, and Jane Wright with that slinky Lady Godiva bit as she mounts up and heads out of White Oaks. I hope it wasn't too cold that day.

    I don't know why this movie has a 6.1 rating. This movie is a classic. The acting is great the story is classic. If you like westerns this is the movie for you. Twist and turns keep you involved. The only downside is that you are not Billy the Kid. As a child every one wished that they were the bad ass cowboy. This movie brings you there and answers your dream. Life, love, violence, sex, destiny, betrayal is all in this story. It is in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It it second to my favorite movie "Last Man on Earth". I am not a huge fan of westerns but this is my top ten movies. Emilio should have won an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

    I have to say Young Guns (the original) was a better movie based more on the facts about the life of Billy The Kid. However, Young Guns II, is probably more entertaining than the it's predecessor. Young Guns II is more based on legend than fact about the life of Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid aka William Bonney can be probably said to be the most legendary and beloved of all the western outlaws. The beginning of the movie starts in a first person narrative--and I'd say beware of movies that start with these character voice overs--but however, that doesn't mean that you are in for a bad movie. The Ten Commandments also has the same set up---and it is campy and kitchy but one of the best movie spectacles of its time. Just like the mysterious life of Billy the Kid, it starts out shrouded in legend. The first person we meet (also played by Emilio Estevez) is Bushy Bill Roberts, a man who lived in the harsh Death Valley climate that claimed that he was Billy The Kid himself. Bill who was considered a harmless oddball homeless man who ran his own Billy The Kid museum in some tiny Southwest town. Bill Roberts claimed on his deathbed that he was the surviving outlaw himself but it was later proved by some facts and disputed dates that he was not the gunslinger. Youn Gun II mostly tells it's story through legend than facts. After the Lincoln County War, Billy was tried for murder and did escape but shooting Bob Bell And Bob Olinger. He did not do a ala Helter Skelter/ Charles Manson act by writing "Garrett's Place" in Bob Bell's blood on the wall. There was also a dispute on how well he knew Pat Garrett. Most say that he may have met Gerrett or knew about him but they were not as best buddies shown in the movie. However, the ending scene where Garret tracks down Billy The Kid and is seen to kill him is also disputed as legend. So since a lot of legend is mixed in with the facts of Billy The Kid's life, the plot or story entertains us like the old romatized dime novels that were sold at the time....What better way to enjoy a Western. The only fly in the ointment is the character of Billy The Kid changes somewhat from a fun but sometimes serious outlaw, to a non impressive giggling joker JackNapier. The dialog can probably be said as the most memorable than the first movie. Also, besides the rocking Bon Jovi album and song that displayed at the end, please check out the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. It has a definite Mexican Southwesten flavor---one of the best that has been ignored by critics. So go forth and saddle up and enjoy! But again, due to the prevalent legend that shrouds Billy The Kid, you might be heading to the library or Wikepedia for more information afterward.

    This movie can't even be classified as a "Western". Emilio Estevez was not convincing. Then, we were subjected to viewing his naked butt. The guy is just not a good actor...Then, someone is always calling after him...."Beellaaay...Beellaaay..." Not, Billy; Beellaaay. Puhleeze. Then, there's the part where Lou Diamond Phillips' character gets stabbed right through his forearm. Can you imagine the pain and bone breakage associated with such an injury? The severed nerves, tendons..the inevitable infection? Nope. The knife was simply pulled out without so much as a wince. Then, he's just fine in the next scene, as if nothing had happened. Nobody was convincing in this film. It just seemed like a bunch of short Hollywood types hamming it up.

    This is the sequel to successful film titled 'Young Guns'(1998 , by Christopher Cain) with similar players and concerning about Billy and his band heading toward the Old Mexico and pursued by a posse. Revisionist and contemporary study about William Bonney, alias Billy the Kid . Billy(Emilio Estevez) became a cowboy in Lincoln County (New Mexico) for cattleman Tunstall allied to Chisum (James Coburn) , but Tunstall is killed and started the Lincoln County war against Murphy as main enemy . Billy seeks revenge for his death and he converted an outlaw and nasty gunfighter with a price on his head . Then Billy along with a young group (Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Lou Diamond Phillips , Balthazar Getty) have their own ethic codes and undergo a criminal spree . The bunch is besieged but they went out firing his gun and made his escape . However , the Kid was caught and convicted of killing and sentenced to be hanged ; though shackled foot and hand , he managed to getaway from prison by shooting dead the deputies (Leon Rippy) guarding him. Pat Garret( William H Petersen), a former friend, was elected sheriff and set off in pursuit to capture him and on 1881 tracked at Fort Sumner and there shot him dead by surprise. It is said that Chisum was instrumental in making Billy the Kid an outlaw killer, he used his considerable influence in getting Garret elected Sheriff of Lincoln County in 1880 and it was Pat who hunted down and killed the young outlaw . Garret and his gang pull off a hot chase against the outlaws. Legend says that Billy murdered 21 men in his 21 years of life but is really thought to be much less. After Pat Garrett was not reelected sheriff of Lincoln County, however he was commissioned a captain in the Texas Rangers. On 19 February 1908 he was driving his buggy on a lonely desert road, he stepped down to urinate and was shot in the back by a hired killer. A man stood trial for the murder but was acquitted. Controversy still surrounds the end of Pat Garrett . This is an in interesting look about the known story of the West's greatest bandit. Contemporary-style Western with acceptable performances and professional direction by Geoff Murphy who creates some good action scenes. The Kid is well played ,though sometimes overacting , by Emilio Estevez, he plays as a likable, sympathetic, attractive young and favourite with girls. This passable Western packs lots of action, shootouts, and explosive violence . Taut excitement throughout, beautifully photographed and with spectacular bloodletting but realized with some flaws . The story is exactly like &uml;The young guns I&uml; with loads of noisy action and violence. The film gets spectacular shoot em'up , thrills , exciting horse pursuits ; it's entertaining , although nothing new but displays an ordinary pace and with no originality . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the fugitives . Colorful and great cinematography by Dean Semler. Modern and unfitting musical score by Alan Silvestri with songs by Jon Bon Jovi. The motion picture will appeal to Western fans.

    Don't get me wrong I like the Good,Bad and the Ugly, The Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma and all the classic westerns, but this movie is different. It' s a movie with heart and an incredible moral value, and it has a lot of funny moments too. You can't run to the end of the time, once you have to face things, and you must have loyalty toward your friends. I have seen it like 5 times, but I enjoy it every time. It has a great soundtrack, the compositor did a great job. Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's far better than the first one. I hope one day will be a third part, till than I will see the second part over and over again.

    After the end of the Lincoln County War a new governor comes to town - one gen. Lee Wallace. He is here to bring order back to the region and plans on doing so by hanging whoever was connected to the war (nevermind what history tells us). Amongst those captured are Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips). Meanwhile Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is roaming the state rustling and hustling. Even tries to get pardon from the new governor, only to be tricked and put in jail. Billy soon manages to escape and breaks out his old pals with him. Together with some new pals like Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) and Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) the come back as the scourge of Lincoln County. But this time a former friend and ally Pat Garrett is hired as the new sheriff... When taking on this movie Emilio Estevez stated it would be closer to historical fact and more gritty. And I would have to say he lied. As far as the original part took some historical liberties this one just rapes them. Naturally some of the changes made in the first part had repercussions in the follow-up (like the death of Charles Bowdre), but I find no logic behind recasting Sutherland and Phillips in the follow-up and even less in them being killed off (given that both Chavez and Scurlock actually had relatively long lives for gunslingers). The main problem with the movie isn't however the history, but the general tone, which basically attempts to make a cool western. Characters are supposed to be savvy, funny and fun, while none of the grit of western movies makes it to the forefront. The whole Billy the Kid character is very poorly thought out by Estevez and his portrayal is one of the weakest. The movie (as in the first part) lacks heart and plods out from beginning to end with no real attempt to entice and engage. The biggest flaw is the lack of a proper counterpoint to Billy's character, someone who would put sense to his actions. There are a few brief scenes, which attempt to do this, but neither Pat Garrett or Doc Scurlock are given good enough lines to actually be able to pull it off. Instead the scenes just dissipate without any dramatic consequence. Given that the action is also not worth of any note it is not surprising that the movie has not stood the test of time and is slowing dropping into oblivion. Nonetheless the movie does have a brilliant score, although I did find myself wondering at times if it actually fits a western.

    The follow up to "Young Guns" is just as entertaining, if nothing more. As for accuracy look elsewhere, because this quick draw teenage (looking to be hip) aimed western is a passable gung-ho outing by director Geoff Murphy. It's not tough, but it's buoyant. One thing I noticed more was the comical angle being in full force with a lot of smarting quips and the blaring image of seeking fame or making a name for yourself as it seems to take priority over ones own life. All glory, little else in seeking to make a name to go down in history. Even Jon Bon Jovi chips away with his tune "Blaze of Glory" and contributes to most of the scorching rock soundtrack. The performances are variably delivered in a dead serious or sardonically cheeky manner. The likes Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and the lively Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid return. Estevez dons on some make-up to age him, which only looks ridiculous and so is his croaky narration running through the feature. Some new faces with Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, Viggo Mortensen and William Petersen's steely conviction giving the best performance of the lot as Pat Garrett. When he takes up the offer to hunt down Billy, there's something imposing about Petersen's figure dressed in black and those glazed eyes. Also you got small parts from Tracey Walter and James Coburn (who played Garratt in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) to chew on his lines to quickly spit them out. Murphy does a stylish job delivering on theatrically set-up gunfights and adding some scope to his craftsmanship. Outside the witty exchanges, there are also plenty of spirited visual gags too. I didn't mind the humour and found it rather fitting.

    Young Guns II takes up a year later from the original movie. Billy has become a Hunted Legend and the government is determined to put the mess called the Lincoln County war behind them by burying the surviving regulators. Billy has formed a new gang with Arkansas Dave Rutabag and Pat Garrett a man who is perhaps Billy's closest friend. When Word reaches him that the New Governor General Lou Wallace is willing to pardon the kid for his crimes if he testfies about the events of the Lincoln county War. Billy doesn't know but Wallace has already rounded up all of his old friends and put them in a pit they're waiting for Billy to join them then they'll all be put to death. Billy goes and uncannily escapes death frees his friends and begins a New war this time against anybody whose against him. Pat Garrett superbly played by CSI's William Peterson provides maybe one of the films best performances he's watchable and his Pat Garrett is sympathetic to Billy but he's not immune to the madness Billy brings with him. All Garrett wants is to be at peace retire and open a eatery until The Government and Wallace and John Chisum persude Garrett to their way of thinking that it would be more of a mercy if Billy was killed by a friend who actually loves him then a faceless Executioner. The Film Explores Billy's final months and delivers a heart pounding finale that will leave you wondering after the film ends.
