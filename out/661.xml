 <sinopse>
  A marshall, personally compelled to face a returning deadly enemy, finds that his own town refuses to help him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  On the day he gets married and hangs up his badge, lawman Will Kane is told that a man he sent to prison years before, Frank Miller, is returning on the noon train to exact his revenge. Having initially decided to leave with his new spouse, Will decides he must go back and face Miller. However, when he seeks the help of the townspeople he has protected for so long, they turn their backs on him. It seems Kane may have to face Miller alone, as well as the rest of Miller's gang, who are waiting for him at the station...

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western.

There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish.

That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to.

Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up.

    All my life I have heard about High Noon and what a classic western it is. I agree that Gary Cooper is great in it and Grace Kely has never been more beautiful , but as to the climax, I'm left baffled. All through the film we are led to believe that the Frank Miller character is coming to town to gun down the marshal. He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.

    I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10

    It may be sacrilegious for a fan of classic movies and Westerns such as myself to speak any ill of High Noon, but I have to admit that I think the script is a little clunky and Gary Cooper is not the most charismatic or believable actor. That said, the story and directing are undoubtedly top- notch. Without preaching or engaging in bravado, Marshal Will Kane embodies the notion that a person should do what is right even when it is difficult and unpopular. Katy Jurado plays Kane's former lover and one of the most intriguing female characters in any classic Western. She easily upstages the better-known Grace Kelly, and is an unpredictable and edgy counterpoint to the straight-laced Kane.

    Whenever I watch a movie, I know the difference between when it's bad and when I simply don't like it. I feel the same way about 'High Noon' as I do with many Hitchcock films. From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale. The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't. From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.

    One of the landmarks of American cinema and rightly so. Gary Cooper is the (very newly) ex-Marshall of a small town who finds himself the lone resident willing to stand up to recently pardoned madman Ian MacDonald. McDonald and his cronies are back for revenge on Cooper and the town that sent him away. Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to "cooperate." Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too. Be warned...you WILL have Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting score playing in your head for days afterward!

    High Noon (1952) **** (out of 4) One of the all time greats dealing with a Marshal (Gary Cooper) who must leave his bride (Grace Kelly) behind on their wedding day when he learns that a former enemy and his gang are going to arrive in town with plans to kill him. It's always hard to pick the "best" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).

    In a town full of yellowbellies, former marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) finds himself on his own to face a released crazed gunfighter, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and Miller's gang. Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to "persuade" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his "claim" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyvillehe's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become "special deputies", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic "the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole storyhe plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered. There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situationif she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to itthe wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

    Three hundred reviews, so what's left to say. Not much, if anything. Seeing the movie again after so many years, I must say it stands up pretty well. Cooper's perfect. That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned. This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.

There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

    High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big "military man" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, "The Tin Star". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.

    This was my first viewing of High Noon. I had always been told to watch it, because it is a classic. WOW !! Its a classic and a half! I simply loved it. This is the construction of a magnificent piece of entertainment by 3 great and visionary artists.... director Fred Zinnemann, producer Stanley Kramer and screen-play by Carl Foreman. They come up with a Western that could have come from Anton Checkov. Its only 85 minutes, but the tension is so thick and un-relenting ..it feels much longer. The increasing looks at a bigger clock, the shots of an empty rail-road---that is bringing darkness and death. No Western had any right to be this good. It is one of the best movies ever made in America (forget Western). If you have never seen this movie ...you should. (That last state meant does not apply to Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings lovers).
