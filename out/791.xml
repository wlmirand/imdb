    The Baby-sitters Club series defined by childhood reading experience. I loved all of the characters and even got into the spin-off specials and series. As a baby-sitter my self and girly girl, these books were my favorite. I found out that there was a 1995 film years later, as a matter of fact right when I had passed my phase of reading the series. I was in a for a wonderful ride. It was an amazing series to see the characters I grew up with come to life in this film. I got to see the traits I loved and hated about them in a movie setting. The movie draws on so many emotions as it makes you laugh, cry, and feel tender. When I return to this movie as a young woman, it makes me feel so nostalgic and get more out of it than as a child. It explores friendship, family conflict, coming of age, and so much more. I recommend it to anyone who has read the books.

    This movie was horrible. Forget the cheesiness and campiness, the fact that they turned Stacey into a lying little witch so she could get Luka was just pathetic. And Kristy's father coming to town wasn't until the bio books on the girls, not the series itself. With the exception of Larissa and Rachel, the actors were horrible. They should have kept to the actual books and not just changed everything. They should have brought in the actors from the TV series as they were better. Karen, Hannie, and Nancy should have been included, as well as Sam and Charlie, Charlotte Johannsen (NOT Rosie Wilder!) Jeff, Becca, and Mary Anne did NOT have short hair!

    For a movie close to home and with girls near my age group I expected there to be characters I could relate too and characters I can practically replace the names of the people with people I knew. That wasn't the case. These girls are probably the most stereotypical stock teenagers I've seen in any movie. All of which have some sort of quality making them blend in, none standing out. Thats not a horrible thing, but the only girl I found I was making connection to was Mary Ann Spier (Rachel Leigh Cook). She was a shy, good listening, and sensitive girl. One I could really see myself relating and hanging out with. Pretty much the good girl, stays out of trouble and popularity, is herself and nothing more. I look for that. With The Babysitters Club though, its exactly what you expect. About twenty minutes in this movie, I took out a voice recorder (compliments to the Motorola Droid) and recording my audio saying what I believed will happen event to event. I was right. Pretty much down to the sentence accurate with the movie. Its clich&eacute; beyond belief. Nothing unique, nothing is colored outside of the lines. "The story you expect from a group of adolescent girls" should be the title. The plot is about a girl named Kristie a thirteen year old tomboyish girl who is the founding member of "The Babysitters Club" a club where girls...babysit. The Babysitters Club consists of Her, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, Mallory Pike, and Jessica Ramsey. Some girls don't get more than ten lines in the film (Mallory and Jessica mainly). The girls open a day-care in Kristie's backyard where they handle dozens of kids and try to keep them in control. They face numerous problems like the kids being a hazard to the neighbor ladies garden, them attracting a group of girls who are out to destroy the club, and Kristie facing troubles when her biological father returns to her side making her keep the secret he's back from her friends and her mother, causing Kristie more stress that is showing on the club and her life all around. The movie is clich&eacute;, beyond clich&eacute;, non-realistic. Its a movie where everything is resolved the easy way out. If my folks were divorced and my dad told me not to tell my mom he's back you damn well better not trust me. Then the mom doesn't seem mad or concerned when her child is acting as strangely as possible. If my mom saw me behaving like that, she'd lock me in her room and make me fess up. Realistic situations, handled unrealistically. I also would like to say for a movie to be called The Babysitters Club. There's more day-care action then babysitting which is bizarre. Its a coming of age film that is clearly just riding off the book series' popularity by using the title and characters. There are no scenes of babysitting at all, just some day-care shots then the rest of the points are dedicated to Kristie's personal life and other issues involving the character's life. So much could have been done with this. It could have been extended with some babysitting scenes gone wrong. Get more into the characters, from what I hear they were extremely built on character development. So one 94 minute movie based on various books doesn't cut it. Especially when the main point, BABYSITTING, is completely abandoned. Still a fair kids movie, but not much of a movie itself. The Babysitters Club will amuse kids from age eight to twelve, but most likely bore kids older. But if you understand the difficult times when adolescents are put under pressure, this will show it in good context. Starring: Schuyler Fisk, Bre Blair, Rachael Leigh Cook, Larisa Oleynik, Stacy Linn Ramsower, and Zelda Harris. Directed by: Melanie Mayron.

    OK, I miss this one. Actually, a lot. I don't know why, but I've been thinking about it like crazy lately. I think it's the season, because I'm sure I got this movie on, or very close to my birthday. I miss the simplicity of it, and how good it made me feel. This was another one that went bye-bye at the garage sale. But, that's OK. Maybe, just maybe, I'll buy it. It'll be good for when I teach, especially if girls dominate the class. I loved this movie. Granted, the story was a little, eh. The acting was OK. I don't know how accurate it was to the book series, as I've never read any that I can remember. I love it. Why did I let it get sold?

    i totally agree with lilygirl90. the books are great but the movie was a little different. still, i enjoyed it just the same. the actors and actresses are really good and the movie is supposed to be based on the book but it turned out a little differently. i think that this movie is a great movie about friendship and how true friends really are like. i also think that kristy's character is very boyish, but hey! that's how kristy's supposed to be! i really enjoyed the movie and i watched it with my parents. they enjoyed it as much as i did. which is very much a lot!i totally enjoyed the movie. not one of my favourites, but i enjoyed it.

    I first saw this movie when I was young like 8 after I starting reading the books. I absolutely loved the books and altho I haven't read all of them (i'm still searching for some and i'm trying to get into the newest series in which the BSC breaks up), I can justify that the movie is OK. Kristy(Bre Blair) is the main character. Her father comes to town and doesn't want anyone to know he's there, so Kristy starts lying to her friends and family and it turns into a big mess. The babysitters start a play group and they have to deal with Cokie Mason (from the books) and her evil plots. Stacey meets this boy who is 17. Stacey was always the "fast" one in the books so I wasn't surprised. Claudia has summer school...not surprised. Dawn and Mary Anne are involved. Jessi and Mallory are in it, but not to a huge extent. The movie basically revolves around Kristy. To me, she acts very selfish in the movie. I like it, but it could've been better. Kristy was never my favorite character in the books so I wasn't pleased with her being the star of the show but oh well. I own the movie and I watch it from time to time, but if you haven't seen it and you love the BSC, get it ASAP.

    My local public library got the DVD of this movie and I snagged it free for a week. I didn't really know what it was about and, after watching it, came away disappointed that I spent the time. For the younger set, mostly 10 to 13 year old girls, it would probably be fairly entertaining. The only two girl actors in this movie who appear, now 10 years later, to be on a career track are Schuyler Fisk (Sissy's daughter) as Kristy Thomas and Rachael Leigh Cook as Mary Anne Spier, best friends in this story. Fisk was the right age, 12, during filming, but Cook was 15. She could get by with that because she is so small and young-looking. I have become a fan of sorts of Cook, I think she does a credible job in her more recent movies. However in this movie her acting is very "high schoolish." Then, when I looked at her profile, realized this was her very first acting job. She had a lot to learn, and has come along very nicely since then. The only really good character was created by Ellen Burstyn, who was the lady next door, who loved to garden, and ended up with a greenhouse after the summer was over. The movie has a simple premise -- a group of 6 or 7 young teen girls band together to form a baby-sitting club. An adult can call a central number and they book whomever is free that evening. For the summer they decide to form a sort of summer camp for the little kids, they figure they can earn maybe six or 7 thousand dollars. It doesn't quite work out that way, but they do have enough at the end to buy potted plants for the lady next door, and still buy a very large pizza. The movie has the usual clich&eacute;' characters, the geeky boys who want the girls' attention, the clueless parents, the mean girls who hang together and plot to mess things up. Directing, camera work, and dialog are all very mediocre.

    The BSC movie wasn't all bad, but it could have been better. I didn't like the casting choices at all. None of the actresses (and actors) in this movie match the description of their characters in the books. However, the cast of the video series is more faithful to the books. The movie, while fun, is very stockish and predictable. There isn't much focus on the kids, either! Sure, we get a glimpse of a child here and there (Jackie Rodowsky is no where near a Walking Disaster in the film), but the primary plot centers on Kristy Thomas. It's too bad that the character of Jessi was horribly underwritten. I'd hate to think that the screenwriter deliberately reduced her to token black person status, but that's pretty much the way Jessi comes across in the film. She only has a few lines to say, and most of them are pretty stupid. The only performances I did enjoy were those of Elizabeth and Watson (Kristy's mother and stepfather). All in all, viewers who are just looking for some mindless entertainment might get some enjoyment out of this film. However, fans of the BSC books and videos would probably be disappointed unless they aren't looking for a faithful adaptation.

    The BSC is the best movie ever. How do I know this? I am a student at Seattle University, that's how. This means that I am quite educated in the realm of fine cinematic masterpieces. In addition to this, I am a Creative Writing major, which means I am also quite knowledgeable about fine literature. I am having quite a bit of trouble reaching the minimum 10 line requirement. I am totally using correct grammar though. Sweet. I win. So there's a maximum of 1,000 words, huh? Who really needs to say that much about a movie in the comment section of a web site? Not me, that's for sure. You know, I wonder if they mean 10 lines in this box or where it shows up...sometimes it's different...oh well. I am finished. I would shout "BSC 4 Eva", but I'm not allowed to shout. Sincerely, Lisa & Katiegotshanked

    This movie was made in a little town called Stoneybrook were a group of 13yr. old girls created a club called BabySitters Club. This begins at the end of the school year and the club wants to give the kids a chance plus the club to be able to have fun and stay together all summer. One day while meeting one of the girls come up with an idea that was marvelous and began trying to make things happen that brings more activities for their clients' children. This began well but things started going bad when 2 girls in the neighbor tried to make things hard for them, but the club did what it had to be done not ruin their fun. This club began when the girls were 11 yrs. old, it began as they were all living in the same neighborhood but now they live in different parts of town as have more clients. They ran into one more situation that summer but guess what BSC became more involved with their neighbors since that busy summer. I enjoyed this movie because not is it a great children's movie but also a movie for the whole family. Ann Martin did a great job going from writing books to making a great movie.

    The BSC is the best movie ever. How do I know this? I am a student at Seattle University, that's how. This means that I am quite educated in the realm of fine cinematic masterpieces. In addition to this, I am a Creative Writing major, which means I am also quite knowledgeable about fine literature. I am having quite a bit of trouble reaching the minimum 10 line requirement. I am totally using correct grammar though. Sweet. I win. So there's a maximum of 1,000 words, huh? Who really needs to say that much about a movie in the comment section of a web site? Not me, that's for sure. You know, I wonder if they mean 10 lines in this box or where it shows up...sometimes it's different...oh well. I am finished. I would shout "BSC 4 Eva", but I'm not allowed to shout. Sincerely, Lisa & Katiegotshanked

    This movie was made in a little town called Stoneybrook were a group of 13yr. old girls created a club called BabySitters Club. This begins at the end of the school year and the club wants to give the kids a chance plus the club to be able to have fun and stay together all summer. One day while meeting one of the girls come up with an idea that was marvelous and began trying to make things happen that brings more activities for their clients' children. This began well but things started going bad when 2 girls in the neighbor tried to make things hard for them, but the club did what it had to be done not ruin their fun. This club began when the girls were 11 yrs. old, it began as they were all living in the same neighborhood but now they live in different parts of town as have more clients. They ran into one more situation that summer but guess what BSC became more involved with their neighbors since that busy summer. I enjoyed this movie because not is it a great children's movie but also a movie for the whole family. Ann Martin did a great job going from writing books to making a great movie.

    The Baby-sitters Club series defined by childhood reading experience. I loved all of the characters and even got into the spin-off specials and series. As a baby-sitter my self and girly girl, these books were my favorite. I found out that there was a 1995 film years later, as a matter of fact right when I had passed my phase of reading the series. I was in a for a wonderful ride. It was an amazing series to see the characters I grew up with come to life in this film. I got to see the traits I loved and hated about them in a movie setting. The movie draws on so many emotions as it makes you laugh, cry, and feel tender. When I return to this movie as a young woman, it makes me feel so nostalgic and get more out of it than as a child. It explores friendship, family conflict, coming of age, and so much more. I recommend it to anyone who has read the books.

    This movie was horrible. Forget the cheesiness and campiness, the fact that they turned Stacey into a lying little witch so she could get Luka was just pathetic. And Kristy's father coming to town wasn't until the bio books on the girls, not the series itself. With the exception of Larissa and Rachel, the actors were horrible. They should have kept to the actual books and not just changed everything. They should have brought in the actors from the TV series as they were better. Karen, Hannie, and Nancy should have been included, as well as Sam and Charlie, Charlotte Johannsen (NOT Rosie Wilder!) Jeff, Becca, and Mary Anne did NOT have short hair!

    For a movie close to home and with girls near my age group I expected there to be characters I could relate too and characters I can practically replace the names of the people with people I knew. That wasn't the case. These girls are probably the most stereotypical stock teenagers I've seen in any movie. All of which have some sort of quality making them blend in, none standing out. Thats not a horrible thing, but the only girl I found I was making connection to was Mary Ann Spier (Rachel Leigh Cook). She was a shy, good listening, and sensitive girl. One I could really see myself relating and hanging out with. Pretty much the good girl, stays out of trouble and popularity, is herself and nothing more. I look for that. With The Babysitters Club though, its exactly what you expect. About twenty minutes in this movie, I took out a voice recorder (compliments to the Motorola Droid) and recording my audio saying what I believed will happen event to event. I was right. Pretty much down to the sentence accurate with the movie. Its clich&eacute; beyond belief. Nothing unique, nothing is colored outside of the lines. "The story you expect from a group of adolescent girls" should be the title. The plot is about a girl named Kristie a thirteen year old tomboyish girl who is the founding member of "The Babysitters Club" a club where girls...babysit. The Babysitters Club consists of Her, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, Mallory Pike, and Jessica Ramsey. Some girls don't get more than ten lines in the film (Mallory and Jessica mainly). The girls open a day-care in Kristie's backyard where they handle dozens of kids and try to keep them in control. They face numerous problems like the kids being a hazard to the neighbor ladies garden, them attracting a group of girls who are out to destroy the club, and Kristie facing troubles when her biological father returns to her side making her keep the secret he's back from her friends and her mother, causing Kristie more stress that is showing on the club and her life all around. The movie is clich&eacute;, beyond clich&eacute;, non-realistic. Its a movie where everything is resolved the easy way out. If my folks were divorced and my dad told me not to tell my mom he's back you damn well better not trust me. Then the mom doesn't seem mad or concerned when her child is acting as strangely as possible. If my mom saw me behaving like that, she'd lock me in her room and make me fess up. Realistic situations, handled unrealistically. I also would like to say for a movie to be called The Babysitters Club. There's more day-care action then babysitting which is bizarre. Its a coming of age film that is clearly just riding off the book series' popularity by using the title and characters. There are no scenes of babysitting at all, just some day-care shots then the rest of the points are dedicated to Kristie's personal life and other issues involving the character's life. So much could have been done with this. It could have been extended with some babysitting scenes gone wrong. Get more into the characters, from what I hear they were extremely built on character development. So one 94 minute movie based on various books doesn't cut it. Especially when the main point, BABYSITTING, is completely abandoned. Still a fair kids movie, but not much of a movie itself. The Babysitters Club will amuse kids from age eight to twelve, but most likely bore kids older. But if you understand the difficult times when adolescents are put under pressure, this will show it in good context. Starring: Schuyler Fisk, Bre Blair, Rachael Leigh Cook, Larisa Oleynik, Stacy Linn Ramsower, and Zelda Harris. Directed by: Melanie Mayron.

    OK, I miss this one. Actually, a lot. I don't know why, but I've been thinking about it like crazy lately. I think it's the season, because I'm sure I got this movie on, or very close to my birthday. I miss the simplicity of it, and how good it made me feel. This was another one that went bye-bye at the garage sale. But, that's OK. Maybe, just maybe, I'll buy it. It'll be good for when I teach, especially if girls dominate the class. I loved this movie. Granted, the story was a little, eh. The acting was OK. I don't know how accurate it was to the book series, as I've never read any that I can remember. I love it. Why did I let it get sold?

    i totally agree with lilygirl90. the books are great but the movie was a little different. still, i enjoyed it just the same. the actors and actresses are really good and the movie is supposed to be based on the book but it turned out a little differently. i think that this movie is a great movie about friendship and how true friends really are like. i also think that kristy's character is very boyish, but hey! that's how kristy's supposed to be! i really enjoyed the movie and i watched it with my parents. they enjoyed it as much as i did. which is very much a lot!i totally enjoyed the movie. not one of my favourites, but i enjoyed it.

    I first saw this movie when I was young like 8 after I starting reading the books. I absolutely loved the books and altho I haven't read all of them (i'm still searching for some and i'm trying to get into the newest series in which the BSC breaks up), I can justify that the movie is OK. Kristy(Bre Blair) is the main character. Her father comes to town and doesn't want anyone to know he's there, so Kristy starts lying to her friends and family and it turns into a big mess. The babysitters start a play group and they have to deal with Cokie Mason (from the books) and her evil plots. Stacey meets this boy who is 17. Stacey was always the "fast" one in the books so I wasn't surprised. Claudia has summer school...not surprised. Dawn and Mary Anne are involved. Jessi and Mallory are in it, but not to a huge extent. The movie basically revolves around Kristy. To me, she acts very selfish in the movie. I like it, but it could've been better. Kristy was never my favorite character in the books so I wasn't pleased with her being the star of the show but oh well. I own the movie and I watch it from time to time, but if you haven't seen it and you love the BSC, get it ASAP.

    My local public library got the DVD of this movie and I snagged it free for a week. I didn't really know what it was about and, after watching it, came away disappointed that I spent the time. For the younger set, mostly 10 to 13 year old girls, it would probably be fairly entertaining. The only two girl actors in this movie who appear, now 10 years later, to be on a career track are Schuyler Fisk (Sissy's daughter) as Kristy Thomas and Rachael Leigh Cook as Mary Anne Spier, best friends in this story. Fisk was the right age, 12, during filming, but Cook was 15. She could get by with that because she is so small and young-looking. I have become a fan of sorts of Cook, I think she does a credible job in her more recent movies. However in this movie her acting is very "high schoolish." Then, when I looked at her profile, realized this was her very first acting job. She had a lot to learn, and has come along very nicely since then. The only really good character was created by Ellen Burstyn, who was the lady next door, who loved to garden, and ended up with a greenhouse after the summer was over. The movie has a simple premise -- a group of 6 or 7 young teen girls band together to form a baby-sitting club. An adult can call a central number and they book whomever is free that evening. For the summer they decide to form a sort of summer camp for the little kids, they figure they can earn maybe six or 7 thousand dollars. It doesn't quite work out that way, but they do have enough at the end to buy potted plants for the lady next door, and still buy a very large pizza. The movie has the usual clich&eacute;' characters, the geeky boys who want the girls' attention, the clueless parents, the mean girls who hang together and plot to mess things up. Directing, camera work, and dialog are all very mediocre.

    The BSC movie wasn't all bad, but it could have been better. I didn't like the casting choices at all. None of the actresses (and actors) in this movie match the description of their characters in the books. However, the cast of the video series is more faithful to the books. The movie, while fun, is very stockish and predictable. There isn't much focus on the kids, either! Sure, we get a glimpse of a child here and there (Jackie Rodowsky is no where near a Walking Disaster in the film), but the primary plot centers on Kristy Thomas. It's too bad that the character of Jessi was horribly underwritten. I'd hate to think that the screenwriter deliberately reduced her to token black person status, but that's pretty much the way Jessi comes across in the film. She only has a few lines to say, and most of them are pretty stupid. The only performances I did enjoy were those of Elizabeth and Watson (Kristy's mother and stepfather). All in all, viewers who are just looking for some mindless entertainment might get some enjoyment out of this film. However, fans of the BSC books and videos would probably be disappointed unless they aren't looking for a faithful adaptation.

She only has a few lines to say, and most of them are pretty stupid. The only performances I did enjoy were those of Elizabeth and Watson (Kristy's mother and stepfather). All in all, viewers who are just looking for some mindless entertainment might get some enjoyment out of this film. However, fans of the BSC books and videos would probably be disappointed unless they aren't looking for a faithful adaptation.

    The BSC is the best movie ever. How do I know this? I am a student at Seattle University, that's how. This means that I am quite educated in the realm of fine cinematic masterpieces. In addition to this, I am a Creative Writing major, which means I am also quite knowledgeable about fine literature. I am having quite a bit of trouble reaching the minimum 10 line requirement. I am totally using correct grammar though. Sweet. I win. So there's a maximum of 1,000 words, huh? Who really needs to say that much about a movie in the comment section of a web site? Not me, that's for sure. You know, I wonder if they mean 10 lines in this box or where it shows up...sometimes it's different...oh well. I am finished. I would shout "BSC 4 Eva", but I'm not allowed to shout. Sincerely, Lisa & Katiegotshanked

    This movie was made in a little town called Stoneybrook were a group of 13yr. old girls created a club called BabySitters Club. This begins at the end of the school year and the club wants to give the kids a chance plus the club to be able to have fun and stay together all summer. One day while meeting one of the girls come up with an idea that was marvelous and began trying to make things happen that brings more activities for their clients' children. This began well but things started going bad when 2 girls in the neighbor tried to make things hard for them, but the club did what it had to be done not ruin their fun. This club began when the girls were 11 yrs. old, it began as they were all living in the same neighborhood but now they live in different parts of town as have more clients. They ran into one more situation that summer but guess what BSC became more involved with their neighbors since that busy summer. I enjoyed this movie because not is it a great children's movie but also a movie for the whole family. Ann Martin did a great job going from writing books to making a great movie.
