    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's eleventh feature film which he co-wrote with Polish lawyer, politician and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Polish screenwriter and director Agnieszka Holland, Polish screenwriter and director Edward Zebrowski and Edward Klosinski, is the second part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and succeeded by "Red" (1994). It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him. It gets worse, with the disclosure that he can't get it up for his wife; ouch! The poor guy loses her, his beauty salon, and is soon to be deported with little money. He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's eleventh feature film which he co-wrote with Polish lawyer, politician and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Polish screenwriter and director Agnieszka Holland, Polish screenwriter and director Edward Zebrowski and Edward Klosinski, is the second part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and succeeded by "Red" (1994). It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him.

He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's eleventh feature film which he co-wrote with Polish lawyer, politician and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Polish screenwriter and director Agnieszka Holland, Polish screenwriter and director Edward Zebrowski and Edward Klosinski, is the second part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and succeeded by "Red" (1994). It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him. It gets worse, with the disclosure that he can't get it up for his wife; ouch! The poor guy loses her, his beauty salon, and is soon to be deported with little money. He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place.

I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's eleventh feature film which he co-wrote with Polish lawyer, politician and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Polish screenwriter and director Agnieszka Holland, Polish screenwriter and director Edward Zebrowski and Edward Klosinski, is the second part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and succeeded by "Red" (1994). It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him. It gets worse, with the disclosure that he can't get it up for his wife; ouch! The poor guy loses her, his beauty salon, and is soon to be deported with little money. He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him. It gets worse, with the disclosure that he can't get it up for his wife; ouch! The poor guy loses her, his beauty salon, and is soon to be deported with little money. He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    I feel kinder towards White than I used to. It does stick out like a sore thumb amongst the trilogy due to its differences from the other two. Male protagonist, more comic (although not radically more), Polish instead of French, more culturally specific. But these aren't reasons to judge it as inferior. It's just different. I actually looked forward to revisiting this one the most. The more light-hearted plot is a nice breather between the others. Zamachowski's performance is deeply endearing, and it's always a treat to see Jerzy Stuhr in any capacity. However, there are still some issues. The cinematography is less distinctive, although there are some lovely images. Kieslowski's characters usually feel very, very genuine. They may be inhabiting a concept, but their behavior is natural. Here, the characters themselves are twisted to suit the purpose of the plot. Dominique is cold and cruel because otherwise Karol wouldn't be so driven towards revenge. Even so, it's hard to believe that Karol would hold his grudge for so long, except that it has to take us to the end point. And the end point is too far-fetched. The scheme is insane, and the flimsy case against Dominique wouldn't hold up in any modern courtroom. It's hard to believe that Kieslowski's collaborator Piesiewicz -- an attorney -- wouldn't have pushed for a more sensible conclusion. Despite these flaws, the film provides an engaging storyline, intriguing situations, and handles the theme of "egalit&eacute;" in a novel fashion.

    Three Colors: White is a puzzling film; it has an entertaining premise, competent performances and an air of mystery and yet there is something missing, something deficient. It may be the increasing focus on the plot instead of the character, but the most important thing that's missing in it is a 'Great Movie' feeling that was so evident in Blue. White has an undeniable appeal which made me watch it twice, but what I did not get after two viewings was any meaning in the film. Karol is a shy hairdresser who is divorced by his dissatisfied wife, and left on the streets with no money and little dignity. He moves to his homeland and starts building a name there and also plans on his ultimate revenge. Here there are two parallel plot lines, one involving a glum fellow who helps him escape and the second involving acquisition of land. Everything helps Karol in blueprinting his revenge. Three Colors White reveals nothing much and seems much frenetic in its pace compared to Blue, except that the effort is comparatively relaxed. I could not get the underlying subtext, perhaps there wasn't one but if there was, then I feel that the director failed in conveying it. Krzysztof is a clever director and here too there are clever scenes. I can enlist a few of them: 1) The comb and the 2 francs which always remain with the protagonist 2) The cogent use of colors including inclusion red, blue and to an extent green 3) Karol shaving in front of a Mother Mary and Christ photo and getting the idea of donating his possessions to the church 4) Karol observing a funeral procession and then planning the 'fake-death' Had the focus been greater on the character, the film would have been memorable. 'White' would appeal to a broader audience but it pales in comparison with its predecessor. My rating: 6.5/10

    Having not yet watched the other two of the Colours Trilogy, I have set down to comment on the middle one as I can't let my agitated heart-rate settle down in any other way. Needless to say, 'white' denotes one colour, of the flag of France, that stands for equality; and this equality is arrived at in the end between Karol & Domininque by the most promising scene of the film where she makes certain intriguing movements of hands indicating her acceptance of his wedding ring. The first hint of doves making Karol's shirt dirty before he enters the court to be mentally decimated my his wife's remarks is the miry & dirty ground whereupon the reconstruction of their broken relation starts & which turns clean, or white, in the end. Those scenes which show how Karol stages his own death to get back his life, i.e. his wife, bear the mark of the creative hammer of Krzysztof Kieslowski; the hot anvil of his always-excellent lighting arrangement & camera-work also delineates the gusto of the Polish procreator of films; the never-before soothing music, too, seems to come from a far away place. In a nutshell, 'Three Colors: White' is a panorama of earthly images, though with some minor defects, providing corneal & aural bliss.

    from http://movieinthepark.blogspot.com/ Three Colors: White. The second of the Three Colors trilogy. (Read previous post) I found this second one to be much better than the first. It's very good. The white color represents the Caucasian, the snow, marriage and innocence (between other things) but these are very related to the movie. It starts in Paris where Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) goes to the court because his wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) wants a divorce. There we understand the reason for the separation is related to Karol's erectile dysfunction. She gives him a bag and tells him to leave. Homeless, he sees himself wanted by the police when Dominique sets up a crime scene attempting to make him leave to where he was from, Poland. He hides in the subway where he meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who helps him get back to Poland hidden inside the bag Dominique gave him. Back in Warsaw, Karol sets up a very singular plan to get Dominique back. But there is a lot more in this movie than a love story. There are a lot of aspects related to the first movie, the old lady struggling to put a bottle in the bottle bank or even a scene from Bleu with Julie (Juliette Binoche) entering in the court room. Julie Delpy is good in this movie, but I've seen her performing more spectacularly. Krzysztof Kieslowski does a very good job. And I'm not talking about the whole trilogy, that will do in the third review. Unlike Bleu, Bialy does not get boring. Watch it. 9/10.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.

    White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison. Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proved. The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proved. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's eleventh feature film which he co-wrote with Polish lawyer, politician and screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Polish screenwriter and director Agnieszka Holland, Polish screenwriter and director Edward Zebrowski and Edward Klosinski, is the second part of his trilogy which was preceded by "Blue" (1993) and succeeded by "Red" (1994). It was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Paris, France and Warsaw, Poland and is a France-Poland-Switzerland co-production which was produced by French director and film producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Karol Karol, a former Polish hairdresser who is left by his French wife Dominique only six months after their marriage due to not being able to meet her sexual demands. Heartbroken and alone in the streets of Paris with no money and no passport, wishing he could return to his native country, Karol has to join the homeless, but as an angel sent from heaven, a nice Polish man named Mikolaj shows up and takes an interest in Karol. As it turns out that Mikolaj is traveling to Warsaw the following day he offers Karol to smuggle him along in a big briefcase. Complications arises after the arrival in Poland and some criminals steal the briefcase where Karol is hiding, but when they discover what's inside it they assault Karol and leave him unconscious. When he wakes up he walks to the city and goes to his old hair saloon which is now run by his brother. Karol gets a job there and his new existence opens new doors. Distinctly and acutely directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this rhythmic and ingenious fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a profoundly moving portrayal of an unlucky man's strive to regain his confidence after being publicly and personally humiliated by the woman he loved. While notable for it's gritty and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designers Halina Dobrowolska and Claude Lenoir, cinematography by Polish cinematographer Edward Klosiski, the fine editing by Polish film editor Urszula Lesiak and symbolic use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven comedy-drama from the early 1990s which stands out from the other parts of the Three Colors trilogy much due to it's humorous tone, depicts an appealing and incisive study of character and contains an exceptional film score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner which emphasizes it's poetic atmosphere. This instantly involving, somewhat romantic, somewhat mysterious, charming and witty independent film which examines themes like identity, liberty, destiny and love, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the memorable acting performances by Polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski, French-American actress, screenwriter and director Julie Delphy and Polish actor Janusz Gajos. An existentialistic, humane, masterful and wonderful piece of cinema which gained the Silver Bear for Best Director Krzysztof Kieslowski at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994.

    White is the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy begins with a suitcase on a carousel at an airport but switches to a man in a Paris divorce court who has trouble understanding French, that his wife, Dominique(Julie Delpy) does not love him. It gets worse, with the disclosure that he can't get it up for his wife; ouch! The poor guy loses her, his beauty salon, and is soon to be deported with little money. He performs music at a train station when he is befriended by a fellow pole, Mikolaj, who offers him cash if he will kill someone for him. Karol is then smuggled in the suitcase from the opening scene, which is stolen by airport workers in Poland. He manages to get a job working for his brother as a hairdresser. He also works as a bodyguard and reunites with Mikolaj in a tunnel, where he is asked to kill him in an assisted suicide. He persuades his intended victim to stay alive. Karol's luck changes as he and his new friend buy and sell land at a huge profit. He has gone from rags to riches. With his new found wealth, he comes up with an idea to win back Dominique and seek revenge. The final shot is quite memorable, an excellent lesson in morality. Be careful what you wish for.

    I went into Three Colors: White with relatively low expectations, hearing almost unanimously that it was the worst of the trilogy by far. While it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the magnificence of Blue, I think that it works quite well in it's own right, although I'm sure my meager expectations helped me to appreciate it a lot more than I would have if I had gone in blind after it's predecessor. Still, White has a lot to be admired. I think that one of the more interesting things Krzysztof Kieslowski has going on in this trilogy of his is the way that he toys with people's expectations. Blue started with a woman losing her husband and child, and the whole thing was this very bleak and wrenching drama of a human being struggling with unimaginable loss, yet it never became a melodramatic tear-fest and strangely ended in a bittersweet, optimistic fashion. It became this sort of anti-tragedy, grown in the most heartbreaking soil but sprouting into something very much it's own creature. White follows the same idea, just in a much different genre. We open with Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) in court, getting divorced from his wife (Julie Delpy) against his wishes, and the first act is a lot of tired clich&eacute;s of the hapless loser getting cuckolded by his bitch ex-wife. She's a real piece of work and it's frustrating watching this moron stumble around trying to win her back when really there is no reason for anyone to not just murder her. Karol has a chance encounter in a subway station with Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), who eventually brings him back to Poland and the whole thing goes down this wild path of wacky antics, with gangsters and guns and the standard scenery. Where Blue was the anti-tragedy, White is very much the anti-romantic comedy. The whole thing is staged around this premise of the loser trying to win back the woman he loves, with all sorts of comedic dealings in between. There are classic setups like Karol hiding in a suitcase that gets stolen at the airport, but Kieslowski presents them all in this very dour and interesting tone. He never goes for laughs, despite the obvious comedic setups and that's what makes this piece so interesting. No, it never reaches the emotional extremes of Blue and I have to admit that I was disappointed by the absence of visual panache that Kieslowski displayed so magnificently in the previous film, but here he focuses much more on telling this straight story without any attention to emotions or significant themes. It's a madcap comedy without the humor (although there was one scene that made me crack up a lot) and it all builds to a delicious twist of a climax. I think that going right into this after Blue gives you a certain expectation, and the drastic change in tone takes a while to get used to. It also doesn't help that the marketing for the film is basically, "Look guys, it's Julie Delpy! You know her, isn't she great? Come watch this movie with her!", when she's only in the film for fifteen minutes. But once I got past those qualms and began to appreciate this for what Kieslowski was doing with it, I really began to enjoy it and by the end it had certainly won me over.

    Equality, schmeequality. The protagonist's personality is developed at length, while we only have select glimpses of Delpy's character. Because her character is not developed properly, we're left with the possibility that Karol is in love with her because of her beauty. Her surface... Yet, throughout the movie, we see life thru Karol's eyes & feel for him...how could this woman be so cruel & not love him despite his flaws in bed. Obviously he loves her. So, this is the perspective...and we're led to feel at the end that she is put in jail as a punishment in a moral sense, for her inability to love him & overlook the flaws. It's a tiresome, weary moral that is drummed into us over & over in movie after movie, TV program after TV program, perhaps because so many stories are told by guys. The moral is this: To all the beautiful, model-like women - you should love us (less than average guys), just look below our surface & see our cleverness, wittiness, resourcefulness, intelligence, innocence, (insert positive quality), etc etc. Yet, you still have to be a model (many movies fail to show other types of women). Anotherwards: appearances shouldn't be important to you, but they are damn important to us. In fact, we won't develop your character any further, but show a limited snapshot (in this case, her vengefulness) & focus on your superficial beauty. MORAL: LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MODEL _ IF SHE CANNOT BE PERSUADED, SHE'S (insert descriptive negative adjectives) We're starting off here with the oldest of inequalities...why not tell a story about a less than average-looking woman who is in love with a modelesque guy, if he doesn't want to be with her, he ends up in jail for being superficial, since he couldn't look beyond her flaws. Or better yet, even out the appearance of both...veer away from the tired clich&eacute;s if you're striving to tell about equality in some way, shape or form. Of course, equality can never be attained, people won't be the same...but let's be a start off a little bit closer than this movie does. By social standards, Dominique is above average in beauty (thin with long beautiful hair and attractive features). Karol is below average height with short arms, OK features. Why not tell a story about him being madly in love with a woman of equivalent beauty. Maybe she's got short legs with a waist that isn't so thin & pock marks on her face. Develop her character a little more...how did she feel when her husband couldn't make love to her (starts to feel unattractive, feels confusion, sadness, unfulfilled, anger that eventually turns her into spite). We are expected to judge her for dumping him for not being able to make love to her. Look, guys cheat on their wives/girlfriends all the time for a lot less, even when they're 'performing' above standard in bed. So if directors habitually setup this double standard, it gets really boring. I want to see directors who are able to tell this story: the gorgeous guy digs deep within himself to appreciate the wonderful qualities below the surface, below the flaws, frailties of a less than average looking woman & he finds that he should learn to look for all the endearing qualities, not be so superficial... I want to see directors tell this story too, especially directors they are able to critique gorgeous women for not doing the same (as what is asked of the gorgeous man in my previous paragraph)....and stop producing loads of movies to convince gorgeous women (or average woman who spend hours to become gorgeous) everywhere that they should go for the 'nerdy schmucks' or old men (who don't spend but a minute or two on their appearances). Well, I don't see that happening until the old men, nerdy schmucks, or sympathizers who make movies can see how hypocritical they're being. Honestly this type of movie would be OK, yikes, if it wasn't for the scalding criticism & lack of character development of Dominique's. You just want to hate her, hmmm? Besides this less than stellar moral, it was a great movie for the rolling sequence of events & character development of the others in the cast...really enjoyed it.

    Apparently most people prefer Blue, I don't (I can see you coming and saying that's it's just my contradictory mind). Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir&egrave;ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.
