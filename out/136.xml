 <sinopse>
  A naive man is appointed to fill a vacancy in the US Senate. His plans promptly collide with political corruption, but he doesn't back down.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith, leader of the Boy Rangers, is appointed on a lark by the spineless governor of his state. He is reunited with the state's senior senator--presidential hopeful and childhood hero, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, however, Smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor. Taylor first tries to corrupt Smith and then later attempts to destroy Smith through a scandal.

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director. Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing. 'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.

    This was a beautiful movie. The ending was intensely dramatic and can bring a stone to tears. Throughout the movie a part of me was going, "Hey! This is sentimental rubbish! This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.

    I hope you all watch this movie ladies and gentlemen. I'm still under the impression of Mr. Smith. I prefer to write this now, not to loose my enthusiasm, as I probably will soon, turning back to routine and triviality of everyday. I find that Mr. Smith is the voice that we all have in us, the voice of the conscience, the need for righteousness. Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review. Do not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!

    The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.

    Jimmy Stewart is best known and remembered for playing the good guy. In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.

    Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C. A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same". Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag. It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.

    Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary. Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film. This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10

    Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient. Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith. In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in. Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state. In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name. The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name. The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before. In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty. This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it. www.lagsreviews.com

    This film is a study of a Good Guy, who wants funding to start a national boys' camp for the "Boy Rangers", going against the Bad Guys, who want to build a dam on the same land only for their own selfish interests (not hydro-electricity or anything, you fool). You may ask why taxpayers would want to pay for a camp only a few of the nation's boys could live near; you may ask why the camp couldn't be built on a different piece of land; you may ask why a private organization should get federal funds; you may ask if there were any issues that constituents would have found more pressing. Well, apparently that's because you're one of the Bad Guys too.

    *** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. *** In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime. I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream. And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern. The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people. But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions. Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.

    The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year. Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director.
