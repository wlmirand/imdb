    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

    This was so bad I had to register here to warn other people. Avoid unless you want see cartoon characters and cgi sea monster making noises. And every clich&eacute; possible in a very bad way. Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

    This was so bad I had to register here to warn other people. Avoid unless you want see cartoon characters and cgi sea monster making noises. And every clich&eacute; possible in a very bad way. Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    When a band of ruthless hijackers invade the world's most luxurious cruise ship, they're shocked to discover the passengers have mysteriously vanished. But that doesn't mean they are alone. Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.

Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    When a band of ruthless hijackers invade the world's most luxurious cruise ship, they're shocked to discover the passengers have mysteriously vanished. But that doesn't mean they are alone. Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen.

The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    When a band of ruthless hijackers invade the world's most luxurious cruise ship, they're shocked to discover the passengers have mysteriously vanished. But that doesn't mean they are alone. Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

    This was so bad I had to register here to warn other people. Avoid unless you want see cartoon characters and cgi sea monster making noises. And every clich&eacute; possible in a very bad way. Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either.

Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J.

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

    This was so bad I had to register here to warn other people. Avoid unless you want see cartoon characters and cgi sea monster making noises. And every clich&eacute; possible in a very bad way. Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    When a band of ruthless hijackers invade the world's most luxurious cruise ship, they're shocked to discover the passengers have mysteriously vanished. But that doesn't mean they are alone. Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Before Deep Rising, long gone were the days of giant sea monster movies... in fact besides Jaws and anything adapted from a Peter Benchley novel, those films never really had their day. Leviathan and Deep Star Six were two other memorable shockers from the 80's and they weren't awesome memorable. Deep Rising revived that genre momentarily in 1998 as a quick witted and action packed horror with a fun cast of characters and buckets of blood, guts and slime. If anything, imagine From Dusk Til Dawn with better actors, a better story and script and with a giant squid instead of big titty vampires with scary Mexican faces. John Finnegan owns an absurdly high speed boat, his crew consisting of his idiot best friend Joey and Joey's Asian girlfriend Leila. Speeding across the ocean, their well-paying cargo is a team of frankly wicked-humoured mercenaries. Their destination is classified, even to Finnegan who accepts the need to know conditions of the job so long as it pays well. Simon Canton is the owner of the world's largest luxury ocean cruise liner celebrating its maiden voyage. Before long laughter and partying turns to disaster, panic and death. When Finnegan and the mercenaries turn up, they find that the passengers of the entire ship have disappeared all but for Canton and some of his crew and a beautiful high-class thief who was arrested and locked in the pantry with all the champagne and chocolate. There is nothing to be taken seriously about this film except for how stunningly awesome the horror and action scenes are. The special effects were of the highest standard for the time and the CGI still outclasses much of the CGI offered today in many high budget offerings. As well as being freakishly terrifying and capitalising on everyone's fear of horrifying sea creature digestion-before-death, this film is well balanced by non-stop absurdly comic humour and it's all thanks to a great script, direction and a well assembled cast. Treat Williams (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead) as Finnegan is as effective as Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds in Firefly. It makes you wonder why he never got the offer to do more similar roles because he's just a great action star and not only delivers comedy as well, he has many a form of chemistry with every co-star he comes into contact with, whether they be friend, love interest, enemy or plain old co-existor. Kevin J. O'Connor who has been in more great films than anyone realises portrays Finnegan's annoying sidekick friend who can't keep his mouth shut. Amazingly, he takes that character intended by the writer and transforms Joey into the kind of idiot you just can't hate. If it had been anyone else (maybe with the exception of Alan Tudyk), it would have failed. Famke Janssen, who was making her steady rise since the mid-nineties comes off as a pro as Trillian St. James but rather than settle for either useless damsel in distress or Ripley-esque ass kicker, she settles in between as a femme just a few comedy punchlines shy of fatale. These are the main characters and the ones you care most about but even the nasty even mercenaries you'll find yourself rooting for, especially when they're led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans, Mystery Men) as a battle hardened lunatic who just doesn't give a damn but knows who he'll choose when faced with lead hero or evil man drinking slimy sea bastard. Admirably his team comprises of Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, the late Trevor Goddard, Clifton Powell and even Djimon Hounsou, a hell of a neat team of B-Movie mercenaries and actors that can put a lot of juice into some otherwise two dimensional villains turned scared wet kittens with mini-guns. Any good thing ever put into an ocean based thriller this film has, from jet ski chases and giant explosions to ship corridor tidal wave chases and realising that you're holding your breath every time someone finds themselves trapped underwater. Music legend, the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Total Recall, Small Soldiers, 13th Warrior) provides the booming orchestral themes and suites in only the way he knew how and what we have here is a film that delivers more than most modern offerings know how to. Director and Writer Stephen Sommers (Jungle Book, The Mummy, GI Joe) did an amazing job and could do with a look down memory lane to get back in gear. But then we might see a return to form with his up coming production of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Recommended with a dry room far from large bodies of water!

    Since I've read several reviews stating this is a 'fun' movie, I thought I would maybe have some great time watching this flick. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First I have to mention that the Chinese/Korean girl acts really really bad, even for an amateur production-- which is not the case. I was mistakenly led to believe it was an horror/suspense movie, and throughout the film, I realized it is more an action picture than anything else-- in fact, I hate this kind of movie. More than that, I have to complaint that people are holding/charging guns ALL the time and shooting for ANY reason. I never saw people so heartless. Every new scene reminds the spectator of "Tremors" and "Anaconda", which means or tends to indict it is not a very original film. Sci-fi effects are poor most of the time; for an instant I thought it was OK for 1998, but then I remember how believable "Alien" was with the technology of 1979, so I presume "Deep Rising"'s special effects are really bad and it's not a wrong impression of mine. It's curious to notice that they chose an old and famous Brazilian song to play, called "Garota de Ipanema"-- which may be the only thing I have to congratulate these filmmakers. Don't ever give this "film" a chance!

    This was so bad I had to register here to warn other people. Avoid unless you want see cartoon characters and cgi sea monster making noises. And every clich&eacute; possible in a very bad way. Just awful. Do not waste your time on this. The ending especially made me want to die. By the way this is nothing like alien movies. no comparison at all. To quote another movie: "This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again ". That is all. Thank you.

    Before Stephen Sommers ended up making effects heavy and not always bang on funny Mummy adventures he unleashed this giant squid wielding B action/comedy-ad venture with a slash of horror thrown in. The biggest ocean liner is launched filled with the rich and famous, casinos and high rollers for some indigestible reason attract the attention of pirates, the non Somali kind. However the pirates are not the only one with an interest in the passengers and crew alike and a giant monster seems to be lurking the decks and it may be more than a match to titanic sinking ice berg. Treat Williams gives a note perfect performance as the lead hero, especially as in the past he tends to be too much of a heavy presence even in lighter roles requiring finesse The special effects are slightly below top notch for the time but its fine, the cast is very good from Wes Studi to Anthony Heald, even Kevin J O'Connor is more bearable than he is in the Mummy films. The film bombed in the box office but it deserves an audience when it pops up on TV.

    You know very much what you're getting with writer / director Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising": a thrill a minute, joke a minute high-tech high-concept combination of action and horror. Essentially, it's like "Tremors" set aboard the Titanic, which could well have been how Sommers pitched it to studios. Finnegan (Treat Williams), a skipper for hire, transports a well armed group of thugs towards an enormous luxury liner. The thugs, led by all-business Hanover (Wes Studi), intend to rob all the passengers of their valuable possessions, but what none of them could have anticipated is that the ship has already been fatally waylaid by an onslaught of ravenous, hideous worm like creatures. The best element about "Deep Rising" is that tongue in cheek quality; Sommers makes sure there's a witticism for every situation, and while this won't be to the tastes of some genre fans, others will appreciate the sense of humour. The pacing is excellent, and the atmosphere undeniable. The sets are impressive, and underscoring it all is a thunderous Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The special effects are pretty good as far as digital monster mayhem goes; FX master Rob Bottin ("The Howling", "The Thing") is the man credited with the creature design, and while his work here isn't among his best, it's not bad at all either. Williams is an absolute hoot as the wisecracking hero. One wouldn't think of him for this sort of role (it's more the kind of thing you'd see Bruce Campbell play), but he makes the most of it. Eye candy is supplied by the luscious Famke Janssen as the spirited leading lady; Una Damon as Leila isn't exactly hard to look at, herself. Kevin J. O'Connor supplies the heaviest comedy relief as the endearingly annoying Joey "Tooch" Pantucci, Finnegans' mechanic and sidekick. An excellent assortment of actors play the thieving baddies to great effect: Djimon Hounsou (whose presence is undeniable), Cliff Curtis, Trevor Goddard, Jason Flemyng, and Clint Curtis. Anthony Heald is malevolent fun as the sleazy owner of the liner, and Derrick O'Connor as the ships' captain rounds out the main cast. They all help to make this very agreeable entertainment, along with a script that has its share of quotable dialogue. All in all, this is equal turns suspenseful, exciting, and downright nasty (there's some juicy gore in here), and it leads to a rousing finale and a truly hilarious resolution that will make one wish a sequel had been made. If you love seagoing creature features as much as this viewer, be prepared to check your brain at the door and enjoy. Eight out of 10.

    Just before the director, Stephen Sommers, made the Mummy franchise he tried to give us a creature feature. It shows that it was a low budget flick. If you see what Stephen did after The Mummy franchise, making a horror called Van Helsing that was a big flop then you know what you are getting. Action and action and a lot of CGI. CGI was the next big thing but was still in his early stage and it shows here when we see the monster. Remember The Faculty from the same year also with Famke Janssen it failed also due the CGI. Still, this flick tries to be two flicks for the price of one. A bit like From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It starts with some hijackers who are out to catch a cruise ship. That takes almost 20 minutes into the flick before we see the CGI cruise ship were some kind of creature hijacks it before they come on board. There's enough of red stuff flying around and skulls to crush on the floor but once the creature comes in view it becomes a bit laughable. In fact, all characters are clich&eacute;s. By doing so it becomes funny sometimes and entertaining but still it isn't Alien (1979). Also a low budget but did give you the creeps. Be honest, the whole story once on board of the cruise ship do reminds you of Alien, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) being the hero also walking around in her undershirt like Ripley did. I enjoyed it, especially the jet ski, but it surely isn't a classic. One to see on a rainy afternoon. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    When a band of ruthless hijackers invade the world's most luxurious cruise ship, they're shocked to discover the passengers have mysteriously vanished. But that doesn't mean they are alone. Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight: a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one.... If you know the work of Sommers, then you will know what to expect from his movies, aside from the fact that they lessen in quality every time a new one is released, but one cannot deny that there is an element of fun to them. And this is the most entertaining movie he has ever done, unlike The Mummy, Van Helsing and GI Joe, this has less budget, but more substance. We have the old rag tag team who are Expendable, shipping a group of bad guys who are even more Expendable, going to rob a ship and then find something more sinister lurking aboard. It all has a whiff of From Dusk Til Dawn to the who,e proceedings, but it's more tongue in cheek than that, and the cast seem to having a whale of a time. Williams is great as the grizzled hero who has all the best lines, ably supported by O' Connor and Jannsen. It all adds up to noting at the end of the film, but it's all good fun while it lasts, despite the awful effects and plot holes.

    What I love about Stephan Sommars is his unapologetic B-movie approach to film making. Not regular B movies, but old-school, 1940s B movies. Even though this film takes place in the modern age, the ornate ship and the square-jawed, irreverent hero scream out 1940s. The movie has the old-fashioned thrills and chills seen in Sommars' other films like The Mummy and Van Helsing. The story is efficient and, while fairly predictable, moves at a brisk pace. The movie follows modern genre conventions like spending the first part of the movie not showing the monster while making it clear there is one, but it follows the conventions as though it invented them. It's not a perfect movie. One bad guy's actions make no real sense, Kevin J. O'Connor has the traditional B movie role of the annoying comedy relief (with a cracking voice like Scooby Doo's owner), and even though the movie is only about 90 minutes long, the last 10 feel a little slack, as though all the good ideas have been used up. But all in all, this was a very entertaining film. I hope Sommars never goes arty and serious on me; he's so good at popcorn-entertainment.

    highest, universal, everlasting accomplishment in unbearably stupid dialog... the conversations between my cat and the rumbling dishwasher are an amazing intellectual, realistic and interesting piece of high literature compared to what some of the annoying characters in this movie abuse the English language for... fun fact: this movie would actually be sort of above average, if it weren't for all those made-up punch lines, created for 14 year all boys that aren't allowed to watch the movie... It's not realistic, it's not smart and i wouldn't care at all, neither be expecting any of that... but those misguided attempts of being funny, cool or even romantic were just way too much...

    ...but things get out of hand in the second half due to an impossible set of coincidences. Treat Williams and his band of hi- tech raiders board a luxury yacht and dump a virus into its operating system to bypass the vault control. So far so good. Except the ship is infested with unbelievably huge and lethal sea creatures and by knocking out the ship's security protocols the raiders just let them loose all over the ship. Oops. If this all seems like an overly contrived way to flip the movie into a salty creature feature, it is. The plot contrivances by that point kill one's suspension of disbelief - there is just too much to disbelieve. What's more the second half of the movie is one long generic run-away- from-the-monster chase sequence already familiar from the Aliens series, not to mention Deep Blue Sea, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and every other watery creature feature of the last thirty years. I found myself bored during what should have been the biggest action payoff of the movie.
