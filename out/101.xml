    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see.

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

    This gets 7/10 from me but that's purely the fan-boy speaking here, it's really not that enjoyable. It was an ambitious project seriously hampered by bad animation - especially the dynamic was way off most off the time - and very inconsistent story quality through the episodes. Also, the "Loc-Nar" frame story was neither asked-for nor did it add anything. Some good songs don't really save this from being a slight to big disappointment. (My biggest disappointment here is the Den episode - Richard Corben's artwork deserves so much better than the *** they put on screen, plus they even gave Den a loincloth - I thought they tried for adult animation!?) As ultimately hollow as HM feels, at least it's much better than HM2000 where they did better on the animation but completely forgot about everything else ...

    If there's any kind of filmmaking that is at a tie with live-action, it is hand drawn animation. It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles. So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant. The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

That's torture enough. That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this. Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else. The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

    I thought this was a fun movie when it came out in 1981, but it really doesn't hold up that well. The first problem is that you have such an extreme mix in tone between the stories they don't fit well together. You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work. A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform. A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one. (which probably could and should have been expanded into a full length feature, which is what they tried to do in Heavy Metal 2000.) Should point out this movie with its excessive sex and gore, could never be made today with the current batch of prudes at the MPAA.

    Heavy Metal is understandably a movie that people are going to love or hate. I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on. Overall, enjoyable but Heavy Metal is a wildly uneven film to me. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    One of the first completely animated SF films, which indicates on the latter direction of development of SF cinematic expression, although there is not a lot of people who would agree on this unusual SF genre. I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own "space opera" and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is "Loch-Narr", a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and "space opera", and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

    I have to recognize the importance that "Heavy Metal" has in the history of animation, being one of the first mainstream examples of adult animation (Which was mostly considered as something from the underground culture at the time when this was made) However, "Heavy Metal" hasn't aged very well: Not only the animation from some segments seem very poor and dated, but also, the plot of most of the stories included in this film seem to be pretty basic and clich&eacute;d. There is a huge amount of gratuitous violence and nudity in this film, but for the most part, this feels like a very bland, forgettable experience. Well, the music is awesome, but sadly, the other aspects of this movie are exactly the opposite. On the other side, I liked very much the Soft Landing sequence, which opens the film, and "B-17", a brief, but effective horror story that was interesting to see. The other segments were mostly boring and repetitive, almost without any quality worth of mention. I think that the "Taarna" segment (The last one) had a decent animation and cool designs, but the plot was way too predictable, slow and clich&eacute;d for my taste. Anyway, despite being a deeply flawed film, it still was much better than the atrocious "Heavy Metal 2000". But for good adult animation done in the eighties, I think that I prefer movies like "American Pop" and "The Plague Dogs".

    This is a total chick flick. It is supposed to be sort of a "follow the glowing object that magically transforms people" story, but really degenerates into boring stories based on racist ideals good for women, but bad for men. There really isn't anything likable about this pile of garbage. Everything is so predictable, it will put you to sleep. Men are supposed to be "cool" because they kill beautiful women. That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap. It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as "chick flick racist" as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

    Heavy Metal is a bizarre animated anthology that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

    Once upon a time, me and my dad were watching Akira, as soon as it ended, my father mentioned Heavy Metal, he said that the animation was awesome, but it was very...spicy. A week later a 720p torrent version finished downloading, don't look at me like that, i don't live in a country where you can find The Secret of NIMH At any store. I watched it and boy....did it sucked. Let me set this straight: i love adult animation, Ralph Bakshi is one of my favorite animators, but when people mix up his work with THIS... No plot, barely any character development, no reason, nonsensical, and the ending? God, it doesn't even count as a spoiler to say that the ball thingy explodes out of nowhere and the girl becomes the next legendary warrior, don't worry, it's not explained well in the movie than it is here. The animation is horrible, i don't know what i am looking at, characters look ugly, i don't know what they are doing, and at times it looks robotic. The music is good, but they play so out of place, why is there playing a music during a space station shot? Overall, overrated movie, everyone loves just because it has sex and violence in it, hey, here's a newsflash: it takes more to make an adult animated film than just sex and violence, it takes a compelling story that you don't see on a animated film for kids, okay?

    I can't really say what it is I like about this movie. It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir ("Harry Canyon") to wacky comedy ("So Beautiful, So Dangerous") to straight out gore ("B-17"). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis. The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously. The film switches to the first story, "Harry Canyon," a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know. On to story #2, "Den." This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of "Harry Canyon." This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER. The third story is "Captain Sternn," the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either. The next story is "B-17," a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway. After the brief segue to full on horror, "So Beautiful, So Dangerous," seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with "Taarna," a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered. After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway. "Heavy Metal" is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.
