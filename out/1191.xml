 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A psychological thriller that takes you through the mind of convicted killer, Michael Raine, and his experiences on death row. Was he guilty of killing his girlfriend or was he a victim of a conspiracy to frame him for a crime he didn't commit? As the story unfolds Jessica Foster, an assistant to the Governor of Tennessee begins to interview Raine while on death row, claiming that she's writing a book about the inmates. Through various circumstances, Raine puts two and two together and builds a case that he believes can prove his innocence...or does he? Ms. Foster is the only one on the 'outside" who can give Raine a voice, but is she working for those who framed him? As time draws near to the date of his execution, in his most desperate hour Raine finds the missing pieces to the puzzle to prove his innocence, but is it too late...? Was this story told from Raine's point of view or from the book writers or from yours, the viewer - you decide.

    When I first heard and read that the lead singer of Poison was staring in a movie I just had to see it. I kept checking the newspapers hoping that it would be showing in one of them but much to my disappointment it didn't. When I became a member of Netflix the movie A Letter From Death Row was my first choice. Not only did Bret write the music for his first time acting but was also Written by, Directed by, Produced by, did his own stunts and from what I have heard and read in interviews he did more behind the scenes work as well. Most people see him as a 80s hair metal rock star, but IMO Bret Michaels is a modern day Renaissance Man. I really hope he not only continues his music career but continues doing other side projects as well!

    "A Letter From Death Row" is awful. The plot: Michael Raine (Michaels) is accused of killing his girlfriend and is put on death row. He starts to think about how he can save his life. This movie is a nightmare to watch. Michaels can't direct or edit at all. There's one scene in the beginning where he does karate moves in front of a mirror and all these color effects and strobe lights start killing your sense of vision. Let's talk about his acting skills: Why? Charlie (Or Charles as he liked to called during 1997-1999) and Martin Sheen drop by to light their dignity on fire. Michaels made another movie in 1998: "No Code Of Conduct". It's a million times better than this. I think all copies of "A Letter From Death Row" should be executed immediately.

    To the people who didn't totally love this movie,Envy is the highest form of flattery to BRET. Almost everyone i know loved it,and think he is an awesome artist(both with poison & solo!) How versatile he is in venturing into film takes a lot of guts!! and he has accomplished more in his life than u could dream of in yours!!! He's overcame a lot with his diabetes,the breakup of his longterm relationship,Having the courage to try new things knowing there will be people out there who may not like his work and doing it anyway is the number one quality of "A REAL MAN!!" and that is exactly what MR BRET MICHAELS is """ A REAL MAN ""moreso than all the men who criticize him out of jealousy!!!!!!!! I LOVE U BRET AND ALL YOUr WORK!!(have for over 20yrs)stay strong keep doing what yr doing,there are people who love all u do.(yr sold out shows say it all) CINDY!!

    Based on what this movie was meant to be, I thought Mr. Michaels did an excellent job. The perspectives he used in his filming were completely unique from what you expect to see these days and I say this as someone that has made 5 films. I found the movie pleasantly surprising in many various ways and when you consider that it was made on a low budget (as I have heard) and it was Mr. Michaels directorial debut I think he should be proud of what he has put together here. I don't believe it was meant to be a mainstream movie and was instead meant to be a cool / hip film....which I feel it was. Three thumbs up on this one.....

    The only reason I watched this movie is because I found out that my favorite local Talk Radio host was in it (I live in Nashville, where it was filmed). He played the defense attorney, and I'm sorry to say he was one of the worst actors in the movie (and that's saying a lot, considering how bad the acting was throughout). It's a good thing he's a good radio host. I guess they tried to save money by using local talent, but talent really isn't the right word. The plot had an interesting twist, but it wasn't enough to save this dog of a movie. I can't believe I even sat through it, and I wasted a spot in my Netflix queue for this.

    Did he actually do it? All through the whole movie he presumed innocence. But then the end was very tricky. He had me confused. Talking to himself, or so the guards said. Plus he got himself confused. I love Bret Michaels so I hope it wasn't him they fried at the end of the movie. Very good movie. Hope everyone can enjoy it. I know I did. Found out a few things I most definitely didn't know, so at least I learned something from it as well. Some very bad murder plots in it as well. One of those 'You're gonna get caught no matter what you do...' but you'll find that out if you watch it. Over all it had a good plot line & a wonderful lead actor who is one of those no one wants to see die, I know I didn't.

    This is probably the worst movie i have EVER seen. The general storyline is a reasonable idea, but the script and acting are just something to be ashamed of. I am amazed that some people think that the movie is brilliant, it isnt even rubbish, it is worse than a channel 5 porno (only english people will get that). Bret michaels is an idiot, poor singer, songwriter and actor, i just cant express how bad this film is. Overall the movie is another example of utter rubbish, but at least decent writers, directors or actors can make rubbish films watchable. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR..... POO !!!

    All in all it was a okay picture. I didn't care to much for it but I can see how some people could. As for Bret Michaels I really don't like his music but this story was alright. It could have worked if they hired some better actors and changed a couple things in the screenplay. For the directing I thought it wasn't too good but there was a couple creative things I did like. Everybody said it had many twists and turns but in my opinion I thought it was pretty predicable, but I guess thats just me. It was okay and I didn't mind seeing it once.

    What can I say, it was awful. Basically you have the pop star, the single famous actor (Martin Sheen for about 90 secs) and a script that actually takes itself seriously. There was a twist in the tale, however, you could see it coming about 10 minutes into the film, and to be honest by the end I just didn't care. Sorry, but cannot think of any redeeming feature

    This Movie Goes To Show You That A Rockstar Can Do Much More Than Sing. Bret Michaels Did A Wonderful Job In This Great Movie. No Only Did He Star In It, He Directed, Produced and Wrote It As Well. This Man Is A Genius, His Acting Was Great and The Plot Kept You On The Edge Of Your Seat Wanting More More More. Even After I Saw This The First Time, I Had To Rewind and Watch Again. All I Can Say Is I Had "Nothin But A Good Time" Watching This Movie.
