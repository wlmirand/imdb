    Right after watching and loving The Wrong Trousers, I decided to give Park's follow-up a re-watch. I have to say as much as he succeeded with mixing crime and western elements into his last work, he comes short here when it comes to romance and mystery. While the occasional laugh can't be denied to any W&G picture, including this one, the whole sheep rustling mystery plot left me completely unimpressed. While the Wallace-Wendolene love story seems charming at first, mostly due to how she mirrors him so much down to her "dog" reading the paper Gromit-style, it quickly becomes unnecessary and boring (almost cringe-worthy during the "leave-me-alone"-sequence) to the extent that one feels nothing during the final action scene and also their final encounter at Wallace's door. Completely unrelated, even Gromit was surprisingly uninteresting here, to the extent that his prison breakdown, which could have been a huge tearjerker moment, didn't do much for me. The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie. However, unless you're huge claymation fan, you can do without this half hour.

    This; the third outing from the now famous 'Wallace and Gromit', sees our unlikely heroes tackling a pair of equally unlikely sheep rustlers. There have been a spate of sheep thefts which have led to a wool shortage; then one night a sheep escapes from the rustlers van and gets into Wallace's house. The next day Wallace gets a call from the local wool shop; they need his window-cleaning services. Once there he is immediately smitten by Wendelene; the shop's owner. It isn't until he gets home that they discover the sheep; which has by now cause quite a bit of damage. After a slight accident while cleaning the sheep Wallace decide to dub it Shaun. It isn't long before they have another run in with the rustlers; this leaves Gromit framed for the crime while Wallace is oblivious to the involvement of Wendelene and her brutish dog Preston. If Gromit is to be saved and the real criminal punished Wallace will have to help Shaun and the other sheep break Gromit out of gaol then confront the evil Preston who isn't quite what he initially appears. To my mind 'The Wrong Trousers' is the best 'Wallace and Gromit' story but this is almost as good; it has all the elements we've come to expect. The chemistry between Wallace and his dog; the silent, but clearly more intelligent, Gromit is perfect making them one of the great comic double acts the fact that they are animated makes it easier to accept the otherwise ridiculous situations. A live action film featuring a dog in a motorcycle sidecar which converts into an aeroplane with a porridge firing cannon would be ridiculous but here it is a work of genius. The variety of Wallace's inventions is impressive as is the way they frequently don't work quite as he planned. Wallace's doomed romance added another emotional side to the story without being too 'mushy' for young viewers. There are of course lots of good laughs to be had although I'll endeavour not to spoil them here! Overall I'd say this is the sort of programme that can be enjoyed by people of all ages even though it is obviously aimed at the younger viewer.

    Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave is the third and final of The Classic Wallace And Gromit adventures which I own on BBC Children's Videos. Not to be confused with The Classic Thomas The Tank Engine Story involving Duck crashing into a Barbar's shop, this version of A Close Shave involves Wallace And Gromit becoming window cleaners, where Wallace finds the love of his life. Her name is Wendeline and she works in a knitting shop where customers buy wool (and yes, this short film involves a lot of sheep!) her dog "Preston" is up to some tricks and it is up to Wallace And Gromit to save the sheep! The film has a lot of memorable moments, such as Wallace finding the love of his life and realising she is not right for him (because of her dislike of cheese!) and this film also introduces us to Shaun (before he gets a TV series of his own!) Along with the first two Wallace And Gromit short films, this will be almost impossible to not enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10!

    The wrong trousers is my overall favourite but this would be 2nd slightly aka as close as a drop of water. It's good for reasons why the wrong trousers is good. Great villain, excellent laughs, even better score and some of the best Wallace phrases. Wallace has been through some love interests and this is the best in my opinion. This is in my opinion the best of gromit with some great mystery and funny sheep with I guess was so popular that they got their own show. My favourite scene is where Wallace is reading the newspapers. I also love the climax It's the saddest with gromit in jail and Wallace's expressions and especially gromit's. It's a great film with some good old Wallace and gromit humour aka sheep falling on Wallace I truly recommend it!

    Wallace & Gromit made a likable debut with A Grand Day Out. The film had some problems to iron out, but by the time of The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park had gained a command of the stop-motion process, and captured lightning in a bottle. The Oscar-winning success of the film turned Wallace & Gromit into household names. Aardman were quick to find the funds for a third instalment. With every Wallace & Gromit film, the animators refine they're craft a little bit further. They become more ambitious. The plots run even deeper. And the animation becomes ever more polished. This is all certainly clear to see in A Close Shave. The Wrong Trousers has a slight edge over the film, but A Close Shave is yet another lively, hilarious Wallace & Gromit adventure. A Grand Day Out had a giddy innocence to it. But it was obvious from The Wrong Trousers that Nick Park was taking the characters into darker areas. A Close Shave goes even deeper, and is further proof that the Wallace & Gromit series is now in a very different place from where it first started. Wallace & Gromit are into a new business venture, window-cleaning. Wallace falls for Wendoline, the owner of a wool-shop he (or rather Gromit) does the windows for. But Wendoline has a secret. A secret that ropes Wallace & Gromit into an adventure with sheep rustlers and a dog who is not the good shepherd he appears. Every film in the series develops an increasing maturation. Not just in the way they're made, but also in the way they're written. Its difficult to remember at this point that A Close Shave was made by the same team of animators who produced the light romanticism of A Grand Day Out. Aardman are working from an all new rule book. The Wrong Trousers had a seriousness to it over its predecessor. But it took some time into the film before we began to notice. With A Close Shave, its impossible not to see it. Heck, the film even abandons Julian Nott's signature theme music, and dives into the storyline. Right from the opening frame, an unmistakable dourness permeates the picture. Wendoline and Preston pull up outside Wallace and Gromit's house in the dead of night. The way Preston is dressed, you know he's got crime on his mind. His face is stern, no-nonsense. Right away we know he's the villain of the film. We need to remind ourselves here that we're watching a Wallace & Gromit picture. That doesn't mean the film isn't funny. We get the usual sidesplitting scenes with Wallace's inventions. Especially good is Wallace gearing up for work with chutes and levers, while Gromit just sits in a sidecar waiting for Wallace to finish up. This film is also a departure from the others in the series by having the first character, other than Wallace, who can speak. Anne Reid gives a sympathetic voice to Wendoline's plight, and never comes between the delightful double-act of Wallace and Gromit, always the heart of the series. One of the best things about The Wrong Trousers was the surprising poignancy Nick Park managed to make us feel for Gromit, watching Feathers McGraw slowly oust him from Wallace's house. He pulls off the same trick again when Preston frames Gromit for sheep-rustling. Seeing Gromit sitting in a jail cell without a friend in the world is a raw, emotional moment. Especially when he gets a present, a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and he starts crying. Its impossible not to feel real sadness for the character. A Close Shave ups the action quotient too. Everyone remembers the train set chase in The Wrong Trousers, but Nick Park and his animation team have gone all out to top that sequence with even more dizzying thrills and spills. Gromit's sidecar going over a cliff and turning into an aeroplane is just as exciting as anything in a James Bond film. And A Close Shave gets itself together for a marvellous climax, when Preston is revealed to be a robot underneath. Gleefully cribbing The Terminator, the sequence with all of the characters on a conveyor belt trying to avoid being crushed is as breathless as it is funny. One criticism you could make of the film is that it isn't as tight as The Wrong Trousers. The film makes many swoops and dives, and the plot line is an engaging one. But A Close Shave takes several viewings to get a proper grasp of the narrative, meaning its not as dramatically taut as The Wrong Trousers, or as instantly accessible as A Grand Day Out. We would have to wait a staggering ten years for the next instalment, Wallace & Gromit's feature film debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, a delightful story just as engaging as any of the shorts. A Close Shave is yet another worthy addition to the canon with plenty for everyone. And look out for Shaun the Sheep, who steals every scene just by being in it.

    The first one was okay, it featured the moon. It was cheesy and didn't really have a plot, although the oven creature was interesting to watch. The second was a lot better, involving a penguin who was a bad guy. However, this third was a VERY big improvement. Sheep that are lost, an evil dog robot, a girl that the main character falls in love it. It's all there. With intense scenes and a lot of drama! One of the key improvements was the amount of special effects done. Sure, most of it was pure clay on frame by frame with camera work. But they added some special effects to enhance the clay world and digital world together. Some include the sparks the sheep's chainsaw produced. And when the dog was flying. These were very great improvement! The thing that gets me is the main character's absolute lack of intelligence, and the dog's intellectual yet still emotional behavior. Even the creator said that was the plan. It's funny and annoying, but just annoying enough to make it almost not funny. Hence the 9/10.

    Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of "the Wrong Trousers" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that "Wrong Trousers" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since "The Wrong Trousers". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a "something bad is going to happen" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

    A lone sheep, later named Shaun, escapes from a sheep rustling plot and hides in the home of eccentric inventor Wallace and his long-suffering dog/best pal Gromit. A silent but deadly canine down at the wool shop appears to be the mastermind behind the plot and frames Gromit for the rustling scam. With a little help from Shaun, Wallace must rescue Gromit and catch the real crooks. There are more laughs and jokes in this half-hour short than most feature-length comedies manage in their entire running time. Nearly every frame has some kind of wit or imagination. The world of Wallace and Gromit, much like the stop-motion world of Postman Pat, is an incongruous mix of post-war Northern countryside crossed with sci-fi and a touch of horror. The horror themes would be explored in greater depth with Curse of the Were-Rabbit but it's handled with more care and sly invention here than in most slasher sequels. A fun time. Catch it on its inevitable Xmas Day screening.

    Though the Wrong Trousers won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, there was absolutely no time to sit back and enjoy their success, because another Wallace and Gromit short was just on the way down the road! I remember when I first saw this one, I really loved it, but though I really love this one, A Grand Day Out is still my personal favorite! This short also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and it very well deserved it! If you really love Wallace and Gromit, then you really need to see this, you will be laughing and laughing, I know that I really was laughing when I saw this movie!! Wallace and Gromit have really, totally, and have completely changed my life, because if Wallace and Gromit had never even been created, I have no idea where I would even be! 10/10

    This is the third Wallace & Gromit short. As you'd expect, the quality of the character design is greatly improved from the first Wallace & Gromit short. Instead of the claymation, soft plastic figures that are poseable are used instead. Additionally, the sets are much more complex and detailed. Now this isn't to say that the stuff in the earlier films is bad--far from it. It's just that with each successive project, the artistry improves. The only complaint I have about this delightful film, and it's a minor one, is that by this third short, the story has become a lot more fanciful and action-packed. In this film, less time is spent being laid-back and gentle (as well as very English) and Gromit even gets to fight against a cyborg dog! But, in spite of this, the film still works very well. Additionally, if you watch this film and the later full-length movie, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, you'll see that there are some similarities in the stories. The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).

The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie. However, unless you're huge claymation fan, you can do without this half hour.

My favourite scene is where Wallace is reading the newspapers. I also love the climax It's the saddest with gromit in jail and Wallace's expressions and especially gromit's. It's a great film with some good old Wallace and gromit humour aka sheep falling on Wallace I truly recommend it!

And A Close Shave gets itself together for a marvellous climax, when Preston is revealed to be a robot underneath. Gleefully cribbing The Terminator, the sequence with all of the characters on a conveyor belt trying to avoid being crushed is as breathless as it is funny. One criticism you could make of the film is that it isn't as tight as The Wrong Trousers. The film makes many swoops and dives, and the plot line is an engaging one. But A Close Shave takes several viewings to get a proper grasp of the narrative, meaning its not as dramatically taut as The Wrong Trousers, or as instantly accessible as A Grand Day Out. We would have to wait a staggering ten years for the next instalment, Wallace & Gromit's feature film debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, a delightful story just as engaging as any of the shorts. A Close Shave is yet another worthy addition to the canon with plenty for everyone. And look out for Shaun the Sheep, who steals every scene just by being in it.

    The first one was okay, it featured the moon. It was cheesy and didn't really have a plot, although the oven creature was interesting to watch. The second was a lot better, involving a penguin who was a bad guy. However, this third was a VERY big improvement. Sheep that are lost, an evil dog robot, a girl that the main character falls in love it. It's all there. With intense scenes and a lot of drama! One of the key improvements was the amount of special effects done. Sure, most of it was pure clay on frame by frame with camera work. But they added some special effects to enhance the clay world and digital world together. Some include the sparks the sheep's chainsaw produced. And when the dog was flying. These were very great improvement! The thing that gets me is the main character's absolute lack of intelligence, and the dog's intellectual yet still emotional behavior. Even the creator said that was the plan. It's funny and annoying, but just annoying enough to make it almost not funny. Hence the 9/10.

    Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of "the Wrong Trousers" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that "Wrong Trousers" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since "The Wrong Trousers". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a "something bad is going to happen" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

    A lone sheep, later named Shaun, escapes from a sheep rustling plot and hides in the home of eccentric inventor Wallace and his long-suffering dog/best pal Gromit. A silent but deadly canine down at the wool shop appears to be the mastermind behind the plot and frames Gromit for the rustling scam. With a little help from Shaun, Wallace must rescue Gromit and catch the real crooks. There are more laughs and jokes in this half-hour short than most feature-length comedies manage in their entire running time. Nearly every frame has some kind of wit or imagination. The world of Wallace and Gromit, much like the stop-motion world of Postman Pat, is an incongruous mix of post-war Northern countryside crossed with sci-fi and a touch of horror. The horror themes would be explored in greater depth with Curse of the Were-Rabbit but it's handled with more care and sly invention here than in most slasher sequels. A fun time. Catch it on its inevitable Xmas Day screening.

    Though the Wrong Trousers won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, there was absolutely no time to sit back and enjoy their success, because another Wallace and Gromit short was just on the way down the road! I remember when I first saw this one, I really loved it, but though I really love this one, A Grand Day Out is still my personal favorite! This short also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and it very well deserved it! If you really love Wallace and Gromit, then you really need to see this, you will be laughing and laughing, I know that I really was laughing when I saw this movie!! Wallace and Gromit have really, totally, and have completely changed my life, because if Wallace and Gromit had never even been created, I have no idea where I would even be! 10/10

    This is the third Wallace & Gromit short. As you'd expect, the quality of the character design is greatly improved from the first Wallace & Gromit short. Instead of the claymation, soft plastic figures that are poseable are used instead. Additionally, the sets are much more complex and detailed. Now this isn't to say that the stuff in the earlier films is bad--far from it. It's just that with each successive project, the artistry improves. The only complaint I have about this delightful film, and it's a minor one, is that by this third short, the story has become a lot more fanciful and action-packed. In this film, less time is spent being laid-back and gentle (as well as very English) and Gromit even gets to fight against a cyborg dog! But, in spite of this, the film still works very well. Additionally, if you watch this film and the later full-length movie, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, you'll see that there are some similarities in the stories. The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).

    Right after watching and loving The Wrong Trousers, I decided to give Park's follow-up a re-watch. I have to say as much as he succeeded with mixing crime and western elements into his last work, he comes short here when it comes to romance and mystery. While the occasional laugh can't be denied to any W&G picture, including this one, the whole sheep rustling mystery plot left me completely unimpressed. While the Wallace-Wendolene love story seems charming at first, mostly due to how she mirrors him so much down to her "dog" reading the paper Gromit-style, it quickly becomes unnecessary and boring (almost cringe-worthy during the "leave-me-alone"-sequence) to the extent that one feels nothing during the final action scene and also their final encounter at Wallace's door. Completely unrelated, even Gromit was surprisingly uninteresting here, to the extent that his prison breakdown, which could have been a huge tearjerker moment, didn't do much for me. The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie. However, unless you're huge claymation fan, you can do without this half hour.

    This; the third outing from the now famous 'Wallace and Gromit', sees our unlikely heroes tackling a pair of equally unlikely sheep rustlers. There have been a spate of sheep thefts which have led to a wool shortage; then one night a sheep escapes from the rustlers van and gets into Wallace's house. The next day Wallace gets a call from the local wool shop; they need his window-cleaning services. Once there he is immediately smitten by Wendelene; the shop's owner. It isn't until he gets home that they discover the sheep; which has by now cause quite a bit of damage. After a slight accident while cleaning the sheep Wallace decide to dub it Shaun. It isn't long before they have another run in with the rustlers; this leaves Gromit framed for the crime while Wallace is oblivious to the involvement of Wendelene and her brutish dog Preston. If Gromit is to be saved and the real criminal punished Wallace will have to help Shaun and the other sheep break Gromit out of gaol then confront the evil Preston who isn't quite what he initially appears. To my mind 'The Wrong Trousers' is the best 'Wallace and Gromit' story but this is almost as good; it has all the elements we've come to expect. The chemistry between Wallace and his dog; the silent, but clearly more intelligent, Gromit is perfect making them one of the great comic double acts the fact that they are animated makes it easier to accept the otherwise ridiculous situations. A live action film featuring a dog in a motorcycle sidecar which converts into an aeroplane with a porridge firing cannon would be ridiculous but here it is a work of genius. The variety of Wallace's inventions is impressive as is the way they frequently don't work quite as he planned. Wallace's doomed romance added another emotional side to the story without being too 'mushy' for young viewers. There are of course lots of good laughs to be had although I'll endeavour not to spoil them here! Overall I'd say this is the sort of programme that can be enjoyed by people of all ages even though it is obviously aimed at the younger viewer.

    Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave is the third and final of The Classic Wallace And Gromit adventures which I own on BBC Children's Videos. Not to be confused with The Classic Thomas The Tank Engine Story involving Duck crashing into a Barbar's shop, this version of A Close Shave involves Wallace And Gromit becoming window cleaners, where Wallace finds the love of his life. Her name is Wendeline and she works in a knitting shop where customers buy wool (and yes, this short film involves a lot of sheep!) her dog "Preston" is up to some tricks and it is up to Wallace And Gromit to save the sheep! The film has a lot of memorable moments, such as Wallace finding the love of his life and realising she is not right for him (because of her dislike of cheese!) and this film also introduces us to Shaun (before he gets a TV series of his own!) Along with the first two Wallace And Gromit short films, this will be almost impossible to not enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10!

    The wrong trousers is my overall favourite but this would be 2nd slightly aka as close as a drop of water. It's good for reasons why the wrong trousers is good. Great villain, excellent laughs, even better score and some of the best Wallace phrases. Wallace has been through some love interests and this is the best in my opinion. This is in my opinion the best of gromit with some great mystery and funny sheep with I guess was so popular that they got their own show. My favourite scene is where Wallace is reading the newspapers. I also love the climax It's the saddest with gromit in jail and Wallace's expressions and especially gromit's. It's a great film with some good old Wallace and gromit humour aka sheep falling on Wallace I truly recommend it!

    Wallace & Gromit made a likable debut with A Grand Day Out. The film had some problems to iron out, but by the time of The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park had gained a command of the stop-motion process, and captured lightning in a bottle. The Oscar-winning success of the film turned Wallace & Gromit into household names. Aardman were quick to find the funds for a third instalment. With every Wallace & Gromit film, the animators refine they're craft a little bit further. They become more ambitious. The plots run even deeper. And the animation becomes ever more polished. This is all certainly clear to see in A Close Shave. The Wrong Trousers has a slight edge over the film, but A Close Shave is yet another lively, hilarious Wallace & Gromit adventure. A Grand Day Out had a giddy innocence to it. But it was obvious from The Wrong Trousers that Nick Park was taking the characters into darker areas. A Close Shave goes even deeper, and is further proof that the Wallace & Gromit series is now in a very different place from where it first started. Wallace & Gromit are into a new business venture, window-cleaning. Wallace falls for Wendoline, the owner of a wool-shop he (or rather Gromit) does the windows for. But Wendoline has a secret. A secret that ropes Wallace & Gromit into an adventure with sheep rustlers and a dog who is not the good shepherd he appears. Every film in the series develops an increasing maturation. Not just in the way they're made, but also in the way they're written. Its difficult to remember at this point that A Close Shave was made by the same team of animators who produced the light romanticism of A Grand Day Out. Aardman are working from an all new rule book. The Wrong Trousers had a seriousness to it over its predecessor. But it took some time into the film before we began to notice. With A Close Shave, its impossible not to see it. Heck, the film even abandons Julian Nott's signature theme music, and dives into the storyline. Right from the opening frame, an unmistakable dourness permeates the picture. Wendoline and Preston pull up outside Wallace and Gromit's house in the dead of night. The way Preston is dressed, you know he's got crime on his mind. His face is stern, no-nonsense. Right away we know he's the villain of the film. We need to remind ourselves here that we're watching a Wallace & Gromit picture. That doesn't mean the film isn't funny. We get the usual sidesplitting scenes with Wallace's inventions. Especially good is Wallace gearing up for work with chutes and levers, while Gromit just sits in a sidecar waiting for Wallace to finish up. This film is also a departure from the others in the series by having the first character, other than Wallace, who can speak. Anne Reid gives a sympathetic voice to Wendoline's plight, and never comes between the delightful double-act of Wallace and Gromit, always the heart of the series. One of the best things about The Wrong Trousers was the surprising poignancy Nick Park managed to make us feel for Gromit, watching Feathers McGraw slowly oust him from Wallace's house. He pulls off the same trick again when Preston frames Gromit for sheep-rustling. Seeing Gromit sitting in a jail cell without a friend in the world is a raw, emotional moment. Especially when he gets a present, a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and he starts crying. Its impossible not to feel real sadness for the character. A Close Shave ups the action quotient too. Everyone remembers the train set chase in The Wrong Trousers, but Nick Park and his animation team have gone all out to top that sequence with even more dizzying thrills and spills. Gromit's sidecar going over a cliff and turning into an aeroplane is just as exciting as anything in a James Bond film. And A Close Shave gets itself together for a marvellous climax, when Preston is revealed to be a robot underneath. Gleefully cribbing The Terminator, the sequence with all of the characters on a conveyor belt trying to avoid being crushed is as breathless as it is funny. One criticism you could make of the film is that it isn't as tight as The Wrong Trousers. The film makes many swoops and dives, and the plot line is an engaging one. But A Close Shave takes several viewings to get a proper grasp of the narrative, meaning its not as dramatically taut as The Wrong Trousers, or as instantly accessible as A Grand Day Out. We would have to wait a staggering ten years for the next instalment, Wallace & Gromit's feature film debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, a delightful story just as engaging as any of the shorts. A Close Shave is yet another worthy addition to the canon with plenty for everyone. And look out for Shaun the Sheep, who steals every scene just by being in it.

These were very great improvement! The thing that gets me is the main character's absolute lack of intelligence, and the dog's intellectual yet still emotional behavior. Even the creator said that was the plan. It's funny and annoying, but just annoying enough to make it almost not funny. Hence the 9/10.

    Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of "the Wrong Trousers" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that "Wrong Trousers" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since "The Wrong Trousers". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a "something bad is going to happen" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).

    Right after watching and loving The Wrong Trousers, I decided to give Park's follow-up a re-watch. I have to say as much as he succeeded with mixing crime and western elements into his last work, he comes short here when it comes to romance and mystery. While the occasional laugh can't be denied to any W&G picture, including this one, the whole sheep rustling mystery plot left me completely unimpressed. While the Wallace-Wendolene love story seems charming at first, mostly due to how she mirrors him so much down to her "dog" reading the paper Gromit-style, it quickly becomes unnecessary and boring (almost cringe-worthy during the "leave-me-alone"-sequence) to the extent that one feels nothing during the final action scene and also their final encounter at Wallace's door. Completely unrelated, even Gromit was surprisingly uninteresting here, to the extent that his prison breakdown, which could have been a huge tearjerker moment, didn't do much for me. The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie. However, unless you're huge claymation fan, you can do without this half hour.

    This; the third outing from the now famous 'Wallace and Gromit', sees our unlikely heroes tackling a pair of equally unlikely sheep rustlers. There have been a spate of sheep thefts which have led to a wool shortage; then one night a sheep escapes from the rustlers van and gets into Wallace's house. The next day Wallace gets a call from the local wool shop; they need his window-cleaning services. Once there he is immediately smitten by Wendelene; the shop's owner. It isn't until he gets home that they discover the sheep; which has by now cause quite a bit of damage. After a slight accident while cleaning the sheep Wallace decide to dub it Shaun. It isn't long before they have another run in with the rustlers; this leaves Gromit framed for the crime while Wallace is oblivious to the involvement of Wendelene and her brutish dog Preston. If Gromit is to be saved and the real criminal punished Wallace will have to help Shaun and the other sheep break Gromit out of gaol then confront the evil Preston who isn't quite what he initially appears. To my mind 'The Wrong Trousers' is the best 'Wallace and Gromit' story but this is almost as good; it has all the elements we've come to expect. The chemistry between Wallace and his dog; the silent, but clearly more intelligent, Gromit is perfect making them one of the great comic double acts the fact that they are animated makes it easier to accept the otherwise ridiculous situations. A live action film featuring a dog in a motorcycle sidecar which converts into an aeroplane with a porridge firing cannon would be ridiculous but here it is a work of genius. The variety of Wallace's inventions is impressive as is the way they frequently don't work quite as he planned. Wallace's doomed romance added another emotional side to the story without being too 'mushy' for young viewers. There are of course lots of good laughs to be had although I'll endeavour not to spoil them here! Overall I'd say this is the sort of programme that can be enjoyed by people of all ages even though it is obviously aimed at the younger viewer.

    Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave is the third and final of The Classic Wallace And Gromit adventures which I own on BBC Children's Videos. Not to be confused with The Classic Thomas The Tank Engine Story involving Duck crashing into a Barbar's shop, this version of A Close Shave involves Wallace And Gromit becoming window cleaners, where Wallace finds the love of his life. Her name is Wendeline and she works in a knitting shop where customers buy wool (and yes, this short film involves a lot of sheep!) her dog "Preston" is up to some tricks and it is up to Wallace And Gromit to save the sheep! The film has a lot of memorable moments, such as Wallace finding the love of his life and realising she is not right for him (because of her dislike of cheese!) and this film also introduces us to Shaun (before he gets a TV series of his own!) Along with the first two Wallace And Gromit short films, this will be almost impossible to not enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10!

    The wrong trousers is my overall favourite but this would be 2nd slightly aka as close as a drop of water. It's good for reasons why the wrong trousers is good. Great villain, excellent laughs, even better score and some of the best Wallace phrases. Wallace has been through some love interests and this is the best in my opinion. This is in my opinion the best of gromit with some great mystery and funny sheep with I guess was so popular that they got their own show. My favourite scene is where Wallace is reading the newspapers. I also love the climax It's the saddest with gromit in jail and Wallace's expressions and especially gromit's. It's a great film with some good old Wallace and gromit humour aka sheep falling on Wallace I truly recommend it!

    Wallace & Gromit made a likable debut with A Grand Day Out. The film had some problems to iron out, but by the time of The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park had gained a command of the stop-motion process, and captured lightning in a bottle. The Oscar-winning success of the film turned Wallace & Gromit into household names. Aardman were quick to find the funds for a third instalment. With every Wallace & Gromit film, the animators refine they're craft a little bit further. They become more ambitious. The plots run even deeper. And the animation becomes ever more polished. This is all certainly clear to see in A Close Shave. The Wrong Trousers has a slight edge over the film, but A Close Shave is yet another lively, hilarious Wallace & Gromit adventure. A Grand Day Out had a giddy innocence to it. But it was obvious from The Wrong Trousers that Nick Park was taking the characters into darker areas. A Close Shave goes even deeper, and is further proof that the Wallace & Gromit series is now in a very different place from where it first started. Wallace & Gromit are into a new business venture, window-cleaning. Wallace falls for Wendoline, the owner of a wool-shop he (or rather Gromit) does the windows for. But Wendoline has a secret. A secret that ropes Wallace & Gromit into an adventure with sheep rustlers and a dog who is not the good shepherd he appears. Every film in the series develops an increasing maturation. Not just in the way they're made, but also in the way they're written. Its difficult to remember at this point that A Close Shave was made by the same team of animators who produced the light romanticism of A Grand Day Out. Aardman are working from an all new rule book. The Wrong Trousers had a seriousness to it over its predecessor. But it took some time into the film before we began to notice. With A Close Shave, its impossible not to see it. Heck, the film even abandons Julian Nott's signature theme music, and dives into the storyline. Right from the opening frame, an unmistakable dourness permeates the picture. Wendoline and Preston pull up outside Wallace and Gromit's house in the dead of night. The way Preston is dressed, you know he's got crime on his mind. His face is stern, no-nonsense. Right away we know he's the villain of the film. We need to remind ourselves here that we're watching a Wallace & Gromit picture. That doesn't mean the film isn't funny. We get the usual sidesplitting scenes with Wallace's inventions. Especially good is Wallace gearing up for work with chutes and levers, while Gromit just sits in a sidecar waiting for Wallace to finish up. This film is also a departure from the others in the series by having the first character, other than Wallace, who can speak. Anne Reid gives a sympathetic voice to Wendoline's plight, and never comes between the delightful double-act of Wallace and Gromit, always the heart of the series. One of the best things about The Wrong Trousers was the surprising poignancy Nick Park managed to make us feel for Gromit, watching Feathers McGraw slowly oust him from Wallace's house. He pulls off the same trick again when Preston frames Gromit for sheep-rustling. Seeing Gromit sitting in a jail cell without a friend in the world is a raw, emotional moment. Especially when he gets a present, a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and he starts crying. Its impossible not to feel real sadness for the character. A Close Shave ups the action quotient too. Everyone remembers the train set chase in The Wrong Trousers, but Nick Park and his animation team have gone all out to top that sequence with even more dizzying thrills and spills. Gromit's sidecar going over a cliff and turning into an aeroplane is just as exciting as anything in a James Bond film. And A Close Shave gets itself together for a marvellous climax, when Preston is revealed to be a robot underneath. Gleefully cribbing The Terminator, the sequence with all of the characters on a conveyor belt trying to avoid being crushed is as breathless as it is funny. One criticism you could make of the film is that it isn't as tight as The Wrong Trousers. The film makes many swoops and dives, and the plot line is an engaging one. But A Close Shave takes several viewings to get a proper grasp of the narrative, meaning its not as dramatically taut as The Wrong Trousers, or as instantly accessible as A Grand Day Out. We would have to wait a staggering ten years for the next instalment, Wallace & Gromit's feature film debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, a delightful story just as engaging as any of the shorts. A Close Shave is yet another worthy addition to the canon with plenty for everyone. And look out for Shaun the Sheep, who steals every scene just by being in it.

    The first one was okay, it featured the moon. It was cheesy and didn't really have a plot, although the oven creature was interesting to watch. The second was a lot better, involving a penguin who was a bad guy. However, this third was a VERY big improvement. Sheep that are lost, an evil dog robot, a girl that the main character falls in love it. It's all there. With intense scenes and a lot of drama! One of the key improvements was the amount of special effects done. Sure, most of it was pure clay on frame by frame with camera work. But they added some special effects to enhance the clay world and digital world together. Some include the sparks the sheep's chainsaw produced. And when the dog was flying. These were very great improvement! The thing that gets me is the main character's absolute lack of intelligence, and the dog's intellectual yet still emotional behavior. Even the creator said that was the plan. It's funny and annoying, but just annoying enough to make it almost not funny. Hence the 9/10.

    Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of "the Wrong Trousers" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that "Wrong Trousers" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since "The Wrong Trousers". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a "something bad is going to happen" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

    A lone sheep, later named Shaun, escapes from a sheep rustling plot and hides in the home of eccentric inventor Wallace and his long-suffering dog/best pal Gromit. A silent but deadly canine down at the wool shop appears to be the mastermind behind the plot and frames Gromit for the rustling scam. With a little help from Shaun, Wallace must rescue Gromit and catch the real crooks. There are more laughs and jokes in this half-hour short than most feature-length comedies manage in their entire running time. Nearly every frame has some kind of wit or imagination. The world of Wallace and Gromit, much like the stop-motion world of Postman Pat, is an incongruous mix of post-war Northern countryside crossed with sci-fi and a touch of horror. The horror themes would be explored in greater depth with Curse of the Were-Rabbit but it's handled with more care and sly invention here than in most slasher sequels. A fun time. Catch it on its inevitable Xmas Day screening.

    Though the Wrong Trousers won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, there was absolutely no time to sit back and enjoy their success, because another Wallace and Gromit short was just on the way down the road! I remember when I first saw this one, I really loved it, but though I really love this one, A Grand Day Out is still my personal favorite! This short also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and it very well deserved it! If you really love Wallace and Gromit, then you really need to see this, you will be laughing and laughing, I know that I really was laughing when I saw this movie!! Wallace and Gromit have really, totally, and have completely changed my life, because if Wallace and Gromit had never even been created, I have no idea where I would even be! 10/10

    This is the third Wallace & Gromit short. As you'd expect, the quality of the character design is greatly improved from the first Wallace & Gromit short. Instead of the claymation, soft plastic figures that are poseable are used instead. Additionally, the sets are much more complex and detailed. Now this isn't to say that the stuff in the earlier films is bad--far from it. It's just that with each successive project, the artistry improves. The only complaint I have about this delightful film, and it's a minor one, is that by this third short, the story has become a lot more fanciful and action-packed. In this film, less time is spent being laid-back and gentle (as well as very English) and Gromit even gets to fight against a cyborg dog! But, in spite of this, the film still works very well. Additionally, if you watch this film and the later full-length movie, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, you'll see that there are some similarities in the stories. The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).

    Right after watching and loving The Wrong Trousers, I decided to give Park's follow-up a re-watch. I have to say as much as he succeeded with mixing crime and western elements into his last work, he comes short here when it comes to romance and mystery. While the occasional laugh can't be denied to any W&G picture, including this one, the whole sheep rustling mystery plot left me completely unimpressed. While the Wallace-Wendolene love story seems charming at first, mostly due to how she mirrors him so much down to her "dog" reading the paper Gromit-style, it quickly becomes unnecessary and boring (almost cringe-worthy during the "leave-me-alone"-sequence) to the extent that one feels nothing during the final action scene and also their final encounter at Wallace's door. Completely unrelated, even Gromit was surprisingly uninteresting here, to the extent that his prison breakdown, which could have been a huge tearjerker moment, didn't do much for me. The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie. However, unless you're huge claymation fan, you can do without this half hour.

    This; the third outing from the now famous 'Wallace and Gromit', sees our unlikely heroes tackling a pair of equally unlikely sheep rustlers. There have been a spate of sheep thefts which have led to a wool shortage; then one night a sheep escapes from the rustlers van and gets into Wallace's house. The next day Wallace gets a call from the local wool shop; they need his window-cleaning services. Once there he is immediately smitten by Wendelene; the shop's owner. It isn't until he gets home that they discover the sheep; which has by now cause quite a bit of damage. After a slight accident while cleaning the sheep Wallace decide to dub it Shaun. It isn't long before they have another run in with the rustlers; this leaves Gromit framed for the crime while Wallace is oblivious to the involvement of Wendelene and her brutish dog Preston. If Gromit is to be saved and the real criminal punished Wallace will have to help Shaun and the other sheep break Gromit out of gaol then confront the evil Preston who isn't quite what he initially appears. To my mind 'The Wrong Trousers' is the best 'Wallace and Gromit' story but this is almost as good; it has all the elements we've come to expect. The chemistry between Wallace and his dog; the silent, but clearly more intelligent, Gromit is perfect making them one of the great comic double acts the fact that they are animated makes it easier to accept the otherwise ridiculous situations.

Wallace's doomed romance added another emotional side to the story without being too 'mushy' for young viewers. There are of course lots of good laughs to be had although I'll endeavour not to spoil them here! Overall I'd say this is the sort of programme that can be enjoyed by people of all ages even though it is obviously aimed at the younger viewer.

    Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of "the Wrong Trousers" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that "Wrong Trousers" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since "The Wrong Trousers". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a "something bad is going to happen" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

    A lone sheep, later named Shaun, escapes from a sheep rustling plot and hides in the home of eccentric inventor Wallace and his long-suffering dog/best pal Gromit. A silent but deadly canine down at the wool shop appears to be the mastermind behind the plot and frames Gromit for the rustling scam. With a little help from Shaun, Wallace must rescue Gromit and catch the real crooks. There are more laughs and jokes in this half-hour short than most feature-length comedies manage in their entire running time. Nearly every frame has some kind of wit or imagination. The world of Wallace and Gromit, much like the stop-motion world of Postman Pat, is an incongruous mix of post-war Northern countryside crossed with sci-fi and a touch of horror. The horror themes would be explored in greater depth with Curse of the Were-Rabbit but it's handled with more care and sly invention here than in most slasher sequels. A fun time. Catch it on its inevitable Xmas Day screening.

    Though the Wrong Trousers won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, there was absolutely no time to sit back and enjoy their success, because another Wallace and Gromit short was just on the way down the road! I remember when I first saw this one, I really loved it, but though I really love this one, A Grand Day Out is still my personal favorite! This short also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and it very well deserved it! If you really love Wallace and Gromit, then you really need to see this, you will be laughing and laughing, I know that I really was laughing when I saw this movie!! Wallace and Gromit have really, totally, and have completely changed my life, because if Wallace and Gromit had never even been created, I have no idea where I would even be! 10/10

    This is the third Wallace & Gromit short. As you'd expect, the quality of the character design is greatly improved from the first Wallace & Gromit short. Instead of the claymation, soft plastic figures that are poseable are used instead. Additionally, the sets are much more complex and detailed. Now this isn't to say that the stuff in the earlier films is bad--far from it. It's just that with each successive project, the artistry improves. The only complaint I have about this delightful film, and it's a minor one, is that by this third short, the story has become a lot more fanciful and action-packed. In this film, less time is spent being laid-back and gentle (as well as very English) and Gromit even gets to fight against a cyborg dog! But, in spite of this, the film still works very well. Additionally, if you watch this film and the later full-length movie, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, you'll see that there are some similarities in the stories. The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).
