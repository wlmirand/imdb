 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A meeting of two world famous climbers, one an experienced mountaineer the other a sport climber, and a journalist (Ivan) results in a bet on which of the two is the best climber. Roger (the mountaineering expert) states that Martin (the sport climber) wouldn't survive a day on a 'real' climbing expedition, although he is considered to be the world's best sport climber (having just won an indoor 'world championship,' an event depicted in the opening scene). They plan to climb 'Cerro Torre,' in the Patagonia region of South America, near the Argentinian/Chilean border, one of the world's most difficult mountains, especially considering the extreme weather conditions common to the area. The rivalry among the two men results eventually in the death of their common friend and the stealing of Roger's girlfriend (Katrina) by Martin. In the end the rivalry results in a 'climb against time' in which Martin and Roger each attempt different routes up the mountain in a race to the summit. But ...

    Definitely one of the least interesting works of Werner Herzog but even so, as one fellow critic noted, even his failures are epic and he makes something good out of them. Once again he explores the conflict between man versus nature, the conflict of man against others and also against himself. While he treats the first in a good way, the second and the third are displeasing, flawed and lacking in depth which drags down most of the film almost downhill, or better saying down the mountain. Climbing the Cierro Torre, all the way up to the top they go. Who's they? One veteran climber (Vittorio Mezzogiorno), one acrobat/wall climber (Stefan Glowacz) trying the impossible for the first time going in one of the most difficult mountains of all, located in Patagonia (3000 meters, which is way shorter than the Everest but still a giant task), fighting against each other for the top of the mountain and for a woman's heart (she is played by Mathilda May). And their duel is followed by a sports reporter (Donald Sutherland) who thinks he's about to cover the event of the century. Plot twist: it looks like someone already had been there but can we trust this guy (Brad Dourif) who says he has left four fingers in there? Maybe... The problem with "Scream of Stone" is to be uninteresting and flat while dealing with themes that are better presented in other movies. The fight between fearless arrogance and defiance versus experience and talent is overdone, and it's not that brilliant in here. He doesn't bring profundity to any of those themes. The ethical aspect when it comes to present facts versus doubts, introduced when the younger guy claims to have been at the top of the Scream of Stone, was almost fascinating. He was questioned by the reporters and true professionals, and out of this moment of his being cornered, having nowhere to go, he accepts the challenge and goes again to the mountain. But even so, Herzog doesn't bring excitement neither to the story and neither to the climbing scenes, the adventure stays too much in the background while the characters are carelessly brought to the foreground but you can't relate with them for too long. The whole set up involving the female going from climber to the other doesn't convince, it's too simplistic and it's only used as a device for the upcoming third act (which works). I mean, she just happen to fall for the winners. You don't get the sense that she loves one or the other. It never reaches the splendorous, poetic and powerful images of "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" or "Fitzcarraldo" but there's beauty in some of them - the mountain has a gorgeous peak, magnificently visualized in the few aerial shots. The cast makes this worthwhile, specially the actor who plays the experienced alpinist. Overall, it's fine, Herzog is working with something he's very familiar with, to being aware of our ambitions and to conquer them regardless of consequences, living the dream even if they look like a nightmare. Just hoped this could be more impressive. 6/10

    Im a mountain climber and love to watch movies about climbing, that stated most movies in this genre usually have really fake seaming climbing scene for example Cliff hanger with S Stalone climbing a huge wall in the Rockies(really Dolomites in Italy) with all the gear but using none of it or the bolt gun?(no such thing). Scream of Stone has plenty of fake stuff to stay in my contrived genre but is way more real, shot in Patigonia with a story by very famous climber (R Messner). There are some very real seaming climbing in this film. For a climbing film this is a ten as a real movie its really a five I gave it a eight as a compromise. All climbers will love this film enjoy

    I saw this at the Seattle International Film Festival in 1991 and was very impressed. I was so surprised that it wasn't in American cinemas soon after. I now have read about the huge price Werner & his people were asking for it. Sometimes distribution issues can kill a film from being seen, and it is us, the audience who gets cheated. Perhaps Werner could have toured the film in the same way that Warren Miller does his ski films. Warren never fails to get that $12 to $15 per ticket, and he doesn't have to worry about popcorn sales. I'd love to see a fresh print of this film released theatrically in 2007 and tour the country.

    Werner Herzog's Scream of Stone is a legend in film sales: a big-budget German-French-Canadian mountaineering drama that became a byword for how not to sell a movie to foreign distributors when they asked so much money that no-one could afford it and it went virtually unreleased before turning up a decade latter on budget DVD (the UK disc retails at &pound;5.99, and this is its first release). It's actually not at all bad, although there's surprisingly little mountaineering in it: the main thrust of the film is the conflict between a legendary mountaineer who fails to climb an infamous Patagonian mountain and the exhibition climber who claims to have done so, with a restrained Donald Sutherland as the sports journalist caught in the middle and Mathilda May making a better job of the obligatory love interest than the script should let her. Brad Dourif turns up briefly as a fingerless climber infatuated with Mae West and seeming to channel the spirit of early Jack Nicholson (well, it is Herzog - you expected restraint?), but even he is less wild than expected. The least successful element is the comic relief introduction of Al Waxman's tiresome TV producer towards the end (as well as an actress who HAD to be sleeping with either the director or one of the producers), but it's not fatal. It's a minor film, but an engaging watch with some good photography (albeit the film was surprisingly not shot in widescreen, presumably to emphasise height over width) and a neat ending.

    There have been times that Werner Herzog stood for quality films. Is this time long past? To my taste Scream of Stone is a terrible bore: soap-like acting with a clich&eacute; deep-voice performance of Sutherland, a clich&eacute; thin story based on the clich&eacute; opposition of intuitive versus experienced climbers, a failure to attain the clich&eacute; excitement of cliffhangers even even when the cliffs are at their steepest. Once more: a terrible bore!

    I must say that I'm little disappointed after watching this movie. It's not this way because I've heard so much about it earlier. It's more like, Werner is trying to do His best because the industry is watching and He wants to show Hollywood His best (this one is even English, not German spoken film). Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. I've seen it few minutes ago (it's 7:54 am, 20/5/2002) and I consider this picture as one of Herzog's worse creations/works (from what I've seen so far). Why is it so? Well.. Firstly I do miss quotes! I cannot forgive this one! I love'em. Quote at the beginning of "The Mystery Of Kaspar Hauser", quote at the end of "Woyzeck"... These are just unforgettable. Here We've got none of this sort. Second issue is this constant lack of feeling, feeling like "are We there.? Is it a dream?"... I personally caught myself few times changing into a daydreamer while watching "Aguirre Der Zorn Gottes" or "Herz Aus Gold" and believe my I am not addicted to drugs ;). Next case here is baddish script (I mean it). After all I gave "Cerro Torre..." 6/10. You may ask why... Well.. again: Donald Sutherland may wake You up if You fell asleep. There's one scene with cigarette (very short, but kept in lively manner) I really like. In my opinion Herzog doesn't focus on the main guy in the story as he did in His previous pictures. Shame on Him! :) This guy isn't bad at all, and PLEASE all of You... do me a favour ... Try to imagine that Kinski plays Roccia,okay? thanks. Mentioning actors, I cannot forget about Brad Dourif.. You'll love this fella. You could see Him in: "One flew over cuckoo's nest" for instance. What Herzog is doing with camera is His business, but I preferred when it was more static, showing more landscapes... etc. We saw it during "Aguirre", "Fitzcarraldo"... Well ! mr Herzog! these are mountains ... shouldn't We watch'em some more, instead of some naked bodies? Sounds coming from the screen are not those of heart-shaking type. One last thing, I believe. You liked it the way Werner put some music here, some music there in "Woyzeck"? Well forget about it... CONCLUSION is: That's not the step forwards, it's .. oops! I don't know exactly where I am, Klaus Kinski is dead (Great Man) and I feel like I must do something completely different. Hello? Is it Hollywood? I'm sorry I'm lost. I must have dialed the wrong number...

    Herzog succeeds to show simultaneously several issues related to climbing. The issue of the spectator: he is rather driven by roman circus spirit than by olympic ideals. The issues of the media: if there is an audience, there is money. The issues of the climbers: they are described as a king of athlete driven by a competitive spirit which allow betting its own life to reach a summit. The outdoors views of the famous Cerro Torre are beautiful and rare. Some spectators might feel bored by the way the film is conducted. Actually, this conduction reminds some Nouvelle Vague issues and many spectators felt bored by films directed by monsters of the Nouvelle Vague like Antonioni, Goddard etc... C'est la vie. Yet, Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein deserves to be seen by those who appreciate Herzog cinema.

    "Scream of Stone" tells of a happenstance competition between a mountain climber and a rock climber to see who is first to the top of a foreboding 3000 ft needle of rock and ice in Patagonia, South America. As with most Herzog flicks, the film is rough hewn and one can imagine the filming crew is having more of an adventure than the characters. Plodding, dull at times, and subpar on most counts the film does feature some good climbing scenes. Pass on this one unless you're into climbing.

    This movie left me with mixed feelings. The filmography is beautiful but the acting not quite. The good thing is that it is really a climbing movie, not an action movie wrapped up into a mountain scenery (like Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit). Some of the actors are real (and good) climbers and one gets a glimpse of the climbing ethics (or lack thereof when sponsors come into the field). The scenario is very loosely based on the story of the first ascent of Cerro Torre, a hard Patagonian peak. Definitely worth seeing if you are into climbing.
