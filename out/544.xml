 <sinopse>
  Five different criminals face imminent death after botching a job quite badly.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jimmy the Saint's business is videotaping the terminally-ill, so that they will be around to give 'Afterlife Advice' to their survivors. He hasn't been doing too well lately and has had to turn to loan-sharks to accomodate his failing business, as well as his expensive personal tastes. When an evil gangster-overlord buys up his note and demands a favor of Jimmy, in exchange for the interest that he can't afford, Jimmy capitulates. Jimmy is to scare someone for the gangster-overlord--really rough them up. Without giving too much away (spoiler), the scene goes down badly and Jimmy and his crew all end up with contracts on their heads for their trouble.

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better.

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan.

When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them.

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".

    Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an excellent and very underrated Gangster Film/Crime Drama that is filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack and is a one of the most Underrated Gangster Movies and Crime Dramas of all time. Set in Denver,Colorado,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead tells the story of an ex-Gangster named Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia(Andy Garcia)who has gone straight and is running a legitimate business and things are going well for Jimmy until his former Boss local crime lord called The Man With The Plan(Christopher Walken)hires Jimmy to do a job for him which makes Jimmy call up his old crew. But when the job goes wrong Jimmy is allowed to live but the rest of his crew are going to be killed and Jimmy has to save his crew before it's too late. Released in 1995,Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is an amazing and underrated Gangster Film Crime Drama that unfortunately came out a year after Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction and was a big failure at the Box Office and many critics dismissed the film and wrote it off Denver as a Pulp Fiction knockoff and a pale imitation of Quentin Tarantino's films. Thankfully,since it's 1995 release Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead has earned respect and a Cult Following over the years and is seen as the great Gangster film and Crime Drama that it is. TTDIDWYD is a great film that gives viewers a look at the city of Denver,Colorado that we have never seen before in movies or television because when you think of the city of Denver you think snow,trees,mountains and the Winter cold,but,with TTDIDWYD viewers are shown a gritty part of Denver,Colorado that wrapped in the world of Gangsters and Film Noir attitudes where the characters are tough and dark and a world where crime and death is in the air and is a world where the characters follow the laws of the streets and violence is the only way to survive. This movie is a Gangster Film and Film Noir that has some of the familiar trademarks of the two genres such as Gangsters,criminals and shows a dark underworld that is cynical and brutal but this film gives us a Gangster movie and Film Noir in a much different style and language that is creative as well as harsh and surreal pulling viewers into a world that's all it's own. This is a film that is also filled with cool and sharp style and great substance and is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the very end and you are glued to the screen wanting to know what happens next and the plot and story moves along at a great pace with unexpected surprises. What I also love about the film is that despite being a Gangster movie and Crime Drama there is a lot of heart and depth with some of the main characters where you feel like Jimmy and some of the other characters wanted to do more with their life. Jimmy The Saint is a great character because even though he wears suits and is cool he wants to lead a straight life away from the Crime world and looking love and trying to find his own morality in the dangerous world he lives and works in and the way Jimmy works with his crew and the way he is outside of his criminal life truly makes Jimmy a very complex character. The screenplay by Scott Rosenberg is amazing and well-written,with Rosenberg giving the main characters great dialog that is original and fresh,gritty and riveting and at the same time darkly funny and offbeat. The great screenplay is one of the things that makes this film wonderful. The violence in the film is brutal,dark and shocking because you never know where or when the violence is going to happen and the violence fits with the tone of the film. The ending of the film is amazing because while the ending is tragic and sad the ending will leave you with an optimistic feeling and will put a smile on viewers faces. A great conclusion. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Andy Garcia is excellent Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia,with Garcia bringing,coolness,intensity and depth to the role. Christopher Lloyd,(Pieces),,William Forsythe(Franchise),Bill Nunn(Easy Wind)and Treat Williams(Critical Bill)all do great jobs as Jimmy's old crew. Christopher Walken is amazing as The Man With The Plan,Jimmy's old boss. Steve Buscemi is riveting and memorable as Mr. Shush,a deadly hit-man. Jack Warden is great as Joe Heff,a guy who's telling the film's story. Gabrielle Anwar is fantastic and sexy as Dagney,Jimmy's love interest. Fairuza Balk is wonderful and memorable as Lucinda,a local prostitute. Bill Cobbs(Malt),Marshall Bell(Lt. Atwater),Michael Nicolosi(Bernard)and Glenn Plummer(Baby Sinister)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Don Cheadle(Rooster),Jenny McCarthy(Blonde Nurse)and Tiny Lister Jr.(House) The direction by Gary Fleder is brilliant and stylish,with Fleder always moving the camera and bringing a dark and gritty visual style to the film. Great direction,Fleder. The score by Michael Corvertino is great,dark and mysterious and matches the film's Noirish tone. Wonderful score,Convertino. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Warren Zevon(Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead),Johnny Cash(Folsom Prison Blues),Ice-T(Mind Over Matter),Blues Traveler(Get Out Of Denver),Tom Waits(Jockey Full Of Bourbon),Louis Armstong(Makin' Whoopee),Bing Crosby(AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive),Dean Martin(You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You),Cachao(Lluvia,Viento Y Cana,Rain,Wind And Reed,A Gozer Con Mi Combo,To Rejoice With My Combo),The Neville Brothers with Buddy Guy(Born Under A Bad Sign)and more. Fantastic soundtrack. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Film Noir,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,an excellent and very Underrated Gangster film,Film Noir and Crime Drama that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    TTDIDWYD is only of any interest if you look for the parallels with The Sopranos - the cast, the pseudo-realistic style, the whole 'being a mobster is no picnic' shtick. The opening scene particularly, following Andy Garcia driving through suburbia with a hard urban soundtrack, is very suggestive of the Sopranos' opening credits. Apart from that, TTDIDWYD isn't much cop. Andy Garcia fails to generate any sympathy - or anti-sympathy - for the character because the script makes him out to be a moron, Christopher Walken fails to convince on any level whatsoever, and the way that 'Jimmy the Saint' sets himself up for catastrophe is so obvious that you get impatient to see how it all goes wrong. "Let me be a cop, Jimmy!", says the super-flake Treat Williams. "Oh, all right then!", says Jimmy. "Idiot!", says the viewer. Only worth watching if you're a Sopranos fan wanting to see a sort of early failed attempt.

    This film shines as a darkly comedic underworld drama with an unbelievably appropriate cast of actors from legends like Walken and Garcia on down to favorite supporting actors like Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The resulting interplay between their characters produces some of the best dialog of the contemporary gangster drama in the setting of post-oil-boom Denver. The plot starts out thin but builds rapidly as Walken's character of "The Man with the Plan " is revealed as a mean-spirited psychopath with a need to spread his own misery to everyone inside his orbit. Garcia's portrayal of dapper, charming ex-gangster Jimmy the Saint, AKA "The Bitch's Bastard" is flawless and ties together the rest of the cast into a plausible crew of small time crooks brought together for some easy money. As the "action" they were conscripted for turns tragic and they find themselves in the claws of Walken's pressure-sore ravaged underworld boss, the film finds surer footing, with Walken and Buscemi delivering convincing, terrifying portrayals of malice in its purest form. While the film's ending leaves something to be desired, the work as a whole has an excellent neo-noir atmosphere and top-notch dialog that earns it a place among more well-known gangster films like "The Way of the Gun" and the "The Usual Suspects."

    Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is directed by Gary Fleder and written by Scott Rosenberg. It stars Andy Garcia, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Bill Nunn, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Elliot Davis. Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is a ex-gangster who finds one of his debts has been bought up by his ex boss, The Man With the Plan (Walken). The Man wants Jimmy to assemble a crew to put the frighteners on a guy who stole the girlfriend of his son, Bernard (Michael Nicolosi), who has been so traumatised by the break up he has taken to "bothering" young girls. Calling on four of his old comrades in crime, Jimmy feels it's a simple job that will finally clear him of his gangster debt whilst earning his hard up pals some cash. However, in fighting threatens to destabilise the group and when the "job" invariably goes wrong they all have to deal with the vengeful aftermath of The Man With the Plan. You wanna throw those pathetic yuks some scratch, I applaud your sensitivity. One of a number of films that surfed in on the wave created by Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is a nifty and potent picture at times, with sharp dialogue, moments of brutalising and a fire-cracker of a neo-noir finale. Yet it's hurt considerably by the ridiculousness of the set up. Film hinges on a "shake down" arrangement that just comes off as a weak excuse for a film, in fact it's bad writing. There are a myriad of ways to set up a heist gone wrong and then have the crims be on the run for their lives, this set up is just pathetic. Buscemi's hit man is poorly conceived, with some glaring conflicting in the characterisation, while the Anwar (beautiful and leaving a good impression) love interest angle could have had much more made of it if the makers had had the courage of their convictions. Give it a name. Still, if you can allow the annoyance of the crappy set up to subside, then there's strong noir themes to indulge in here. A one time bad boy struggling to escape his past and characters stuck in a bleak destiny influenced rut they can't get out of. There's a pervading sense of depression hanging over the film, which in a twisted way makes for good film, while the character dynamics are strong because the characters are very memorable. Helps, too, that they have awesome names like Jimmy the Saint, Critical Bill, Franchise and Mister Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards. Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10

    Jimmy the saint(Andy Garcia) is a former gangster trying to go straight with an "afterlife" business where he videotapes the dying for the surviving relatives and friends. He gets lured back into the crime world for one last job by. Theman with the plan(Christopher Walken). Jimmy recruits Critical Bill(Treat Williams), in his darkest role, and Christopher Lloyd as Pieces. Jimmy and his crew set up an a abduction dressed as police officers and it all goes horribly wrong. The violence is intense, but the black humor is in the style of Quentin Tarantino, crisp and hilarious. Steve Buscemi shows up later on as a hit man, and he has never been better. I won't give away any more of the story but will just say that it is one of the best crime capers I've ever see..

    An excellent little crime drama that went under the radar for most people and didn't get the recognition it deserved from the critics. True - in many ways it could easily be labeled as just 'another Tarantino copy', the influence of Reservoir Dogs are hard to miss. Unlike most of Tarantino's followers, though, Things to Do in Denver has a distinct voice and style, solid storytelling with a fresh and interesting look at a familiar subject, and above all - a fantastic, colorful cast, with some standout performances from actors you don't usually see in this genre - Christopher Lloyd and Treat Williams stand out, and Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi deliver some of their finest performances. For lovers of the genre it's very well recommended.

    This film could have been so much better. The storyline is good and offered the potential for the making of an excellent film, but ultimately it disappointed, which was a real shame. I'll give you my opinion on what really let this film down. There were two things: Andy Garcia - he's an average actor at best and here, he really spoilt the essence of the main character. He didn't have enough depth, conviction or raw energy needed for such a dark mob character. He put too much emphasis on typically ridiculous Hollywood style over-acting, and not enough to reflect what the character was about. Shame on the casting director for picking him. Someone more in the mould of Harvey Keitel or Gary Oldman would have been perfect. His relationship with the main lady - unlike other mob films where there is genuine development of a love interest, this film had a haphazard and an unconvincing romance story. In other films, like Carlito's way, Casino, Goodfellas, there was so much more on offer and the love interests became an integral part of the mobsters lives. Here, it was a dreary and irritating sideshow. There are very good parts of the film. Chrisopher Walken, who I am a big fan of, was excellent. His role as the crippled mob boss was perfectly cast and he played it superbly. He was suitably detached, unflinching, dark and menacing. Steve Buscemi, who I am also a fan of, was also excellent. He was also cast perfectly as the quiet, quirky yet violent hit man. Overall, the story line was good, Walken and Buscemi and some of the supporting actors were excellent, but the main character and the over-emphasis on style ultimately let this film down. Worth a watch, but I struggle to tell you much about it. For me, that's enough of a sign.

    This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy

    "Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead ": among the many feelings this titular sentence evokes to me, the first and major one is the constant frustration about the misunderstanding that surrounds this little gem of a film. Using the word 'overrated' to describe it is almost obscene. Cinema is full of mysteries and one of the most blatant is how the hell there is not any ounce of recognition to one of the freshest and most original crime flicks of the nineties. Some wiser minds would argue that this film had the unfortunate fate to be released after "Pulp Fiction", and then would automatically pale in comparison with Tarantino's original masterpiece. For me, it doesn't and I would go as far as saying that this film is simply "Pulp Fiction" with a heart. The script was written before "Pulp Fiction"'s release, which makes the coincidence even more tragic since we can all agree that there is a Tarantinesque mood inhabiting the film. But that doesn't diminish its merit, on the contrary, the writing is only one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, the screenplay is so confidently meaningful it will unexpectedly immerse you into the depths of human psychology. The story is crucial to appreciate the beauty of the script and this is precisely why I said 'unexpectedly' : the movie will surprise you. I will never forget the first time I saw it, it blew me away. More than a crime film, it's a story of friendship &agrave; la "Once Upon a Time in America" and redemption &agrave; la "Mean Streets", two classic cinematic themes  but how many other gangster films make you also think about the meaning of life? The story is centered on one character: Jimmy "The Saint" portrayed by the great Andy Garcia as an ex-criminal, one who redeemed himself, and runs now a very particular business. This, Tarantino didn't invent, and no other movies did, there's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film. The business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die, letting some posthumous advice and guidances to their beloved ones. This 'after-world' business, not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive, but works as a great plot element driving the film. The various real-life situations featured in Denver's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons, like one about the magic of the first date when Jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite Dagney, played by Gabrielle Anwar. The whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls, life, death and love and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons. Jimmy's pivotal life moment occurs when he's approached by two thugs who work for The-Man-With-The-Plan, Christopher Walken in my favorite of his villainous roles. Jimmy has a debt with The-Man : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission. It's the kind of missions you don't know if it's so simple,it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail. The-Man's dim-witted son Bernard, psychologically hurt by a painful break-up, was seen attacking a little girl in the playground, the guy is no pedophile though, just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways. He's a pathetic victim, he lost his mother in an accident, and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love, he asks Jimmy and his men, to discourage the boyfriend of Bernard's ex and convince her to go back to Bernard. What a schedule! And the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film, they're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre. I mentioned "Once Upon a Time in America" ... well, the movie reunites the great William Forsythe as "Franchise" the tattooed good-family-man, and Treat Williams as the unforgettable "Critical" Bill, a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year. I don't want to spoil it for you, but Williams is a show stealer in every single scene, as the man whose hobby it to 'work up' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in. The rest of the team features Bill Nunn as "Easy Wind" and Christopher Lloyd, who makes a memorable come-back as "Pieces", the veteran, who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy. A cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including Fairuza Balk as Lucinda, the crack-whore whose only addiction that's not a drug is her sincere love for Jimmy, Steve Buscemi as the scary professional hit-man Mr "Shh" and last but not least, the late Jack Warden, as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote, creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery. This is the set-up of the film, a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement, men who tries to turn their back to the past, each one in a personal way. All they have to do is the job. Of course, when you get the idea of Jimmy's business and when you memorize the title, you understand that the film won't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... Not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually "glides" with a beautiful view on life, so if you haven't seen it, just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script, so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life, especially a very poignant one from Christopher Lloyd. Watch this film to finally get the meaning of "Buckwheat" or "Boat Drinks!" and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of "Things to Do in Denver", a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of "Pulp Fiction" and to be so severely underrated

    This is a spotty but extremely memorable thriller, one of a slew of offbeat American crime pics made in the mid-90s. Andy Garcia (the punchy trainee cop from The Untouchables) is an ex-con with a new venture: filming terminally ill people so they can speak to friends and family from beyond the grave. In debt to bankroller Christopher Walken, he plans a heist, enlisting the help of several other actors who've escaped from the 1980s, among them Treat Williams  brilliant in Lumet's Prince of the City  Christopher Lloyd (Doc from Back to the Future) and William Forsythe (Once Upon a Time in America). Garcia spars romantically with Gabrielle Anwar, while keeping an eye out for troubled Fairuza, and trying to stay one step ahead of Steve Buscemi's slick hit-man, Mr Shhh (so called because he "don't say much"). This stylish, intriguing picture has too many lulls and inconsistencies to trouble anyone's top films list, but Balk is absolutely arresting in her supporting part, and there's a melancholy, nostalgic undercurrent reinforced by Garcia's backward-looking catchphrase: "Back in the day".
