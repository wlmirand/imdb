    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10

    Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, anddespite some shady family tieshas a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything. Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10

    Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, anddespite some shady family tieshas a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10

    Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, anddespite some shady family tieshas a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything. Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10

    Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, anddespite some shady family tieshas a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything. Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10

    Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, anddespite some shady family tieshas a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything. Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **&frac12;

    The Firm is a thriller. It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything. Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family. Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm. He is an innocent man, more like a boy, having just come out of law school. He neither understands faithfulness for not only does he cheat on his wife, but he steals somebody else's wife. Mitch wants to be free: when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return. Thus in this movie he finds himself trapped, being torn by two forces that he hates and looking for a way out. Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn. Even so, he still had nothing to do with his mother and it is actually through Aggie's mouth that we learn that he has a mother. Avery (Gene Hackman) is one of the other major characters. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant bad guy (I don't think that he really suits good guys). The nature of his character changes through the movie. It is not possible to go in too deep because it will probably give away too much. Avery is Mitch's mentor, and he sort of guides him through the first part of the movie. The Firm is a very good movie with a very unravelling plot. My only gripe is that Mitch runs off with Aggie who happens to be married to somebody else. There is a distinct lack of faithfulness shown in this movie but then Mitch is faithful to very few people and has little faith in anybody else. Mitchel McDeere is definitely not a role model and should not be treated as one.

    The Firm,a best-selling by John Grisham,is about young lawyer named Mitch McDeere,who joins a prestigious law firm at Memphis,Tennessee.Later on,he discovers that is has a sinister dark side as it is part of the mob. Mitch McDeere,played by Tom Cruise,is a young man with a promising future in law as he is about to graduate from Harvard Law School as among the Top 5 in his class. He is approached by Bendini, Lambert and Locke.He and his wife, Abigail or Abby,played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, move to Memphis, where it is located. Avery Tolar,played by Gene Hackman becomes his mentor. He was offered with lots of money and showered with lots of gifts and benefits, including a house and car,he is at first totally has no knowledge to the more sinister side of his company. Then, two associates are murdered. The FBI contact him, asking him for information and informing him that not that the film is connected connected to the mob. Aside from that,every associate that has ever tried to leave was murdered. His life as he knows it is forever changed. He has a choice: work with the FBI and risk being discovered by or stay with his employer knowing that at sometime he will get involved with laundering mob money and in the end go to jail. He then devises a plan that allows him to cooperate with the FBI by finding proof that all partners were guilty of over billing, while at the same time reaching an agreement with the Morolto brothers. Aside from that,he manages to do so without breaking any laws, thereby being able to keep his status as a lawyer.In the end,the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis for Boston, driving the same car they arrived in. The movie's story isn't as powerful as the book as it played it safe for the character of Mitch McDeere. That is why it never stood out in my opinion as one of the best John Grisham novels that were turned into movies unlike The Rainmaker and The Chamber.But nevertheless,the acting was decent with Tom Cruise,Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,David Strathairn and Holly Hunter.It was also entertaining in a good way but not as great as the book.

    The movie "The Firm" without doubt is one of Tom Cruise best films. He leads an all star-cast, playing a Harvard graduate lawyer who lands a dream job at a Memphis law firm. Not long after he joins the firm the nightmare begins. He wonders what he's got himself involved in. A bunch of Mafia thugs who are laundering money back and forth to the Cayman Islands. Cruise gives a believable performance as Mitch McDeere who is on the run from the Mafia. Gene Hackman also gives one of his best performances as Avery Tolar since Lex Luther in (The Superman Movies), and Secretary David Brice in (No Way Out). There were other good performances from Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter as Tammy, Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, Wilford Brimley as the scary grim-faced law enforcer for the firm. Overall, the film moves along nicely with Cruise carrying most of the film. However, being a John Grisham fan and having read the book I thought the film makers could have stuck to the ending in the book. Anyway, I can't complain because Cruise does a good job and is a believable Mitch McDeere.

    What a bad joke this is. Did the author actually go to law school? What lawyer is disbarred because he is coerced into revealing his clients private information under the fear of death? Preposterous. Never happen. Yes, this young lawyer should be more worried about a new job than death. And then there is the nonsense about all these clients willing to overpay their bills instead of changing their legal help by going to a new firm!!!! It's so stupid it is hard to be believed. It's far-fetched but this is the book. Can't blame the movie for being lousy if the book is lousy.

    The Firm is a decent movie with a promising storyline that dosen't really deliver.The movie certainly shouldn't be called a thriller,it wasn't very exciting and it wasn't something that I couldn't keep my eye away from.I was impressed with Tom Cruise,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Gene Hackman and Ed Harris performances and their probably the only reason why this score isn't much lower,because their all just very talented and did the best they possibly could with this overall dull and boring movie.I wouldn't recommend the Firm,especially not to fans of thriller's,it isn't exciting as the story makes it seem,and it is dragged out way too much,with two hours and a half,and it gets boring after about the first hour.The movie is too plain,simple and long but fans of these actors will appreciate their performances. Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise),a trained lawyer,joins a prestigious law firm only to discover their business is dangerously shady.

    Mind you, I was never a Tom Cruise fan, nor am thrilled by his roles. But in two movie he is very god - in this one, and in Operation Valkyrie. Both are his stellar performances. Here, we see the John Grisham's classic novel turned into a classic thriller with excellent cast, including Gene Hackman, Jane Tripplehorn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris among many, and then there is Tom Cruise who delivers his best role as a young and aspiring lawyer, Mitch McDeere. The plot is well-known and there is no need in retelling the events, but what a great tempo! What a beautiful camera work, what excellent views of Cayman Isles and Memphis! The plot is twisted and goes on very fast, despite 2 hours of timing. The work of all the movie team is decent and the result never disappoints. The movie is very captivating, and it runs very smooth, allowing us to enjoy the splendid play, great music score by Dave Grusin and like every moment of this very fresh and strong film. Highly recommended

    The Firm is too good to be true: starring Tom Cruise at the top of his acting game (before he became an action-hero, cartoon version of himself), Gene Hackman at his wry, lecherous best (in a "Letch Luthor" role, a categorization my father likes to give this type of role Hackman seems to attract), Jeanne Tripplehorn, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Paul Sorvino, and others; based on one of the best and most screen-worthy of John Grisham's legal thrillers; adapted by Tony Award-winning writer David Rabe, Academy Award-winning writer Robert Towne (Chinatown), and Edgar Award-winning writer David Rayfiel; directed by the late, great, prolific Sydney Pollack, who seemed to have a knack for the genre (ref: Three Days of the Condor). Cruise plays Mitchell McDeere, a Harvard law student who chooses as his first post-graduate employer a small, Memphis firm with a family appeal ("we keep each other's secrets"), spacious accommodations inlaid with mahogany and marble, country club membership, and a six figure offer (in New York dollars). Bendini, Lambert and Locke seems too good to be true. The firm sets up Mitch and his wife Abby (Tripplehorn) with a low-interest mortgage and a brand new Mercedes, sends Mitch to client meetings in the company jet, and pays off all of his student loans. But there are ghosts painted on the walls: portraits of attorneys who met with untimely, "accidental" deaths. Both Abby and Mitch detect weirdness, but Mitch is more reluctant to assume foul play. When he does find out who the firm's real clients are, he still can't believe it. "Nothing is real until I tell it to Abby," he says to his incarcerated brother, Ray (Strathairn)a line that always hits home with me, since my wife's name is Abbey. To reach his objectives of getting out without getting offed, and, more importantly, to get his life back, Mitch employs, more than once, an interesting tactic: telling the truth (or some form of it). He buys some time and trustworthiness by immediately reporting his "run-in with the FBI" to the partners of the firm. He mutes potential blackmail leverage by confessing his infidelity to Abby. He allays the mob's suspicion by divulging the firm's overbilling scheme. Dave Grusin's piano-driven, initially upbeat, jazzy score takes on an edgy, suspenseful pulse as the action culminates in a heart-pounding chase over Mud Island. The firm within The Firm seemed too good to be true, and it wasa fictional front for criminal activity, but the only crime committed by The Firma fabulous work of movie fictionis that it's simply too good.

    I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down. Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs? This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book. On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion). Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces. 8/10
