    This simple picture depicting Manny, a middle aged man whose wife has recently died, makes one of the most difficult situations in his life: to hire a nanny to take care of their little daughter whilst he prioritises with his work. Despite this picture's lack of popular appeal and box office performance, it would seem intolerant to suggest that this picture is not a moving or deeply thought-provoking. The picture, set during the late 1950s, is a wonderful depiction of how two people so "different" can come together at a time when it wasn't politically or socially acceptable. The true stars of this movie, Goldberg and Liotta, portray the taboo of an interracial relationship at the time and convey this difficulty with such serenity and authenticity. The infrequent injections of Goldberg's comedy enable the film to be not just a sadistic and morbid tale of the hardships of America's shame, but an attempt to remind audiences that we have finally reached a place of equality where interracial love is acceptable. Goldberg's character is utilized as a tool to encourage mediation between the lost Manny and his daughter Overall, Corrina, Corrina is a truly beautiful film that raises the question of African-Americans being accepted into white society and serves a message to illustrate the history of America's black peoples and how, really, we're all the same.

    i was very surprised at the low rating for this film, however when you read the reviews there is very little negative comments. A little 4 year old girl/father lose their mother/wife in the sixties in America. the little girl is so traumatised by the loss of her mother that she becomes mute. the father is not sensitive enough to her emotional distress to be able to help her. Enter Whoopi Goldberg as a nanny who through emotional literacy and counselling skills/ or good mum skills whatever you want to call it is able to heal the girl. the other theme dealt with is the obvious issue of racism and cross cultural love: a beautiful little film, good acting well dealt with enjoy will

    I've not read many bad reviews for this film, and when I do it's usually someone whining and complaining about Hollywoods liberal agenda and how this film is simply a poor manifestation of that. Sorry but not every film about controversial subjects has to have a hidden agenda. I strongly suspect it's something else entirely, mainly the fact that a White male and a Black woman have a romance and certain narrow-minded people don't like to see that. They don't come right out and say this, but instead blame it on typical "Hollywood liberalism". I don't agree. I think the writers had a story to tell, and this just so happened to be the subject matter. And what a wonderful little story it is. It tells the story of how a widower, played by Ray Liotta, and his daughter (Tina Majorino) who are trying to pick up the pieces of their life after the death of the mother (who by the way is never shown in the film). Ray Liotta immediately begins looking for a nanny to watch after his daughter so he can return to work. Whoopi Goldberg, who plays the title character, is the only one who seems to be able to reach the daughter and bring her out of her shell. The dynamics of Tina and Whoopi's relationship are what give the movie a real special quality. Whoopi, as always, is a joy to watch. And I just can't say enough about Majorinos acting abilities at such a young age. She's simply a natural, and I'm totally shocked that her career didn't take off like it should have. She's unbelievable. Corrina, Corrina mixes just the right amounts of levity and drama to create a warm, heartfelt film that's easy to watch over and over again. There are just so many little moments that I can only describe as "adorable". I'm usually not so syrupy about films, but with this one I just can't help it. It never gets old.

    Corrina, Corrina (for IMDb) I stubbornly refuse to sneer at this 'period' film, which I think was not critically well received. Some of its themes are close to my heart  but even without this I'd be inclined to smile on such a gentle film, with such great  and such consistently miscast  actors. It's the early 60s (isn't it?) and newly widowed Manny Singer (Ray Liotta, for once cast against type) is struggling to hold down a job as a jingles writer, while raising distraught daughter Molly on his own. (** Very minor spoilers from here**) He employs widow Corrina Washington, and their rocky road to an understanding, healing Molly along the way, is the subject of the film, played with gentle humour. The small pleasures go on and on: Whoopi Goldberg in a film quiet and sedate enough to be a fine showcase for her super-dry wit; Ray Liotta, such a charismatic actor, finally getting to play a good guy, not a wise guy; the lovely child actress Tina Majorino, our eyes and ears in this film; the delightful ice cream hues, shot lovingly by serious cinematographer Bruce Surtees (much favoured by Clint Eastwood I believe); the elegiac inclusion of Don Ameche at the very end of his life; the supporting cast including the wonderful Curtis Williams as Percy. I could go on. All right, so in truth, not a lot happens; so the story isn't very original, more a hymn to a rosily remembered Jewish American childhood than great cinema - but so what? It's a pure pleasure to watch. Only one thing bothers me, given the interesting subtext of the film (**small spoiler**): why exactly, in 1994, did they need to make the kiss take place in near-total darkness (some 30 years after the period depicted in this film)? And whose decision was that?

    I love the start of the movie: Feet and shoes of people in the funeral. We do not know how the mother died. They do not tell and we do not really need. I like movies that does not give excess information. It is also beautifully tangent with race issues without poking our eyes about it. Children's part in the movie was extra beautiful! There is a wonderful scene that starts with the gospel song "This little light of mine" where black and white kids are on the tree and asking each other "Do you taste like chocolate?" and the other asks "Do you taste like vanilla?" and then they lick each other to see. This is not just a cute movie but also simply substantial.

    Engaging, sweet natured comedy-drama from writer/producer/director Jessie Nelson. Story tells of a widower whose recent loss sees him hiring a maid/nanny to help keep house and mind his young daughter. The catch is Corrina is African-American, and when the two become close, society frowns. This is the fifties folks. Nelson balances his film well, and shows an obvious love of children as he indulges in several cute scenes. Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta turn in serviceable performances, but it is Tina Majorino who steals the show as the lovable ragamuffin who doesn't understand why Mommy isn't coming back. Don Ameche and Joan Cusack appear briefly. Rick Cox's enjoyable score is based upon themes composed by Thomas Newman. Editor Lee Percy has allowed "Corrina, Corrina" to overstay its welcome just a little bit, but otherwise this is a touching, simple heart-warmer from Jessie Nelson that comes recommended to family audiences.

    Here's example number 87,358 of Hollywood's anti-Biblical bias, so typical of them. Early on, Ray Liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of Bible study ever day." This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. Once again, the Bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. That woman, of course, is dismissed immediately. Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil&agrave;, saves the day! Yawn.

    This is one of the few movies (in my opinion) that 'gets' what she can do... Most of her work is comedic, and her comedy chops are definitely evident, but the connection she makes with this family shows the love of a child and a man (who just happen to be white) during a time when it was (even potentially hazardous if not) unorthodox to have an interracial relationship. I have to admit that I've only seen this movie on cable, and when they show it on (I think TBS) they cut out the "N" word at a time that makes the scene make no sense. But I stop dead in my tracks to watch... The daughter is confronted as a "N" lover. She reailzes that the word means a black person, but she does not realize that the word is a racial slur. As far as she is concerned, she is with the people who love her, and she loves them, in the pure way that it seems only children can love, in return. These omissions are an example to me of how some networks, and more broadly a Black actress(I've heard her say that she doesn't like the term "African American"-"we're ALL Americans" I seem to remember...) is missplaced even in this decade. The Oscar win is not a fluke. Hollywood has yet to face or offer an opportunity that truly shows off her full potential. I feel that her peer is Robin Williams in terms of a comedian that Hollywood still has yet to see their potential.

    "Corrina Corrina" is very much a film of the 1990s set in the 1950s. Miss Goldberg uses her tried and trusted "Feisty Black Woman" schtick but it doesn't sit well in a movie set in an era when,whether we like it or not,black people behaved very differently amongst white people. The Little Rock desegregation episode occurred as late as 1957 and the Civil Rights marches were some time in the future,few blacks felt secure enough to go against the wishes of their white employers or even cuss and swear in their presence. Clearly there is a strong political edge to this movie,it could hardly be otherwise given our current obsession with racial and religious tensions both in the U.S and the U.K.Black Christian woman and white atheist Jew fall in love - I'm not sure how convincingly - but conveniently,for the very basis of the movie is that love laughs at locksmiths.Would that it were true. From "Romeo and Juliet" onwards playwrights have been telling us it isn't,but we're still clinging on to the hope. A few remarkable people succeeded in ignoring the social pressures,but even in the 21st century race and religion are barriers that can prove insurmountable. Commendably, in "Corrina Corrina" nobody pretends it's going to be easy for Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg.It is a measure of the film's effectiveness that I felt concerned for their future. There is some wonderful music,we hear Louis Armstrong and Oscar Peterson doing "You go to my head" and Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg duet Bill Evans' "Peace piece" on the piano quite delightfully.The title of the film is derived from an old blues song. Despite the caveat of my first paragraph I did enjoy this movie. As the lights went up I realised that hope springs eternal in the human breast - even mine.

    CORRINA, CORRINA ****1/2 Jesse Nelson produces, directs, and writes this heartwarming, thoughtful tale set in 1950s suburbia, where Whoopi Goldberg starts working for an emotionally damaged family by taking care of the single Dad's daughter. The unfolding and flow of each act is smooth-flowing and properly paced as Goldberg positively impacts the family - from the point where the mute-by-choice daughter starts talking again, to Goldberg becoming romantically involved with Dad - that will bring a smile to your face and joy to your heart. It's one of those films that achieves as a great drama yet is also very comical at the right times, and is laced with social commentary, adding more depth.

    CORRINA, CORRINA ****1/2 Jesse Nelson produces, directs, and writes this heartwarming, thoughtful tale set in 1950s suburbia, where Whoopi Goldberg starts working for an emotionally damaged family by taking care of the single Dad's daughter. The unfolding and flow of each act is smooth-flowing and properly paced as Goldberg positively impacts the family - from the point where the mute-by-choice daughter starts talking again, to Goldberg becoming romantically involved with Dad - that will bring a smile to your face and joy to your heart. It's one of those films that achieves as a great drama yet is also very comical at the right times, and is laced with social commentary, adding more depth.

    This simple picture depicting Manny, a middle aged man whose wife has recently died, makes one of the most difficult situations in his life: to hire a nanny to take care of their little daughter whilst he prioritises with his work. Despite this picture's lack of popular appeal and box office performance, it would seem intolerant to suggest that this picture is not a moving or deeply thought-provoking. The picture, set during the late 1950s, is a wonderful depiction of how two people so "different" can come together at a time when it wasn't politically or socially acceptable. The true stars of this movie, Goldberg and Liotta, portray the taboo of an interracial relationship at the time and convey this difficulty with such serenity and authenticity. The infrequent injections of Goldberg's comedy enable the film to be not just a sadistic and morbid tale of the hardships of America's shame, but an attempt to remind audiences that we have finally reached a place of equality where interracial love is acceptable. Goldberg's character is utilized as a tool to encourage mediation between the lost Manny and his daughter Overall, Corrina, Corrina is a truly beautiful film that raises the question of African-Americans being accepted into white society and serves a message to illustrate the history of America's black peoples and how, really, we're all the same.

    i was very surprised at the low rating for this film, however when you read the reviews there is very little negative comments. A little 4 year old girl/father lose their mother/wife in the sixties in America. the little girl is so traumatised by the loss of her mother that she becomes mute. the father is not sensitive enough to her emotional distress to be able to help her. Enter Whoopi Goldberg as a nanny who through emotional literacy and counselling skills/ or good mum skills whatever you want to call it is able to heal the girl. the other theme dealt with is the obvious issue of racism and cross cultural love: a beautiful little film, good acting well dealt with enjoy will

    I've not read many bad reviews for this film, and when I do it's usually someone whining and complaining about Hollywoods liberal agenda and how this film is simply a poor manifestation of that. Sorry but not every film about controversial subjects has to have a hidden agenda. I strongly suspect it's something else entirely, mainly the fact that a White male and a Black woman have a romance and certain narrow-minded people don't like to see that. They don't come right out and say this, but instead blame it on typical "Hollywood liberalism". I don't agree. I think the writers had a story to tell, and this just so happened to be the subject matter. And what a wonderful little story it is. It tells the story of how a widower, played by Ray Liotta, and his daughter (Tina Majorino) who are trying to pick up the pieces of their life after the death of the mother (who by the way is never shown in the film). Ray Liotta immediately begins looking for a nanny to watch after his daughter so he can return to work. Whoopi Goldberg, who plays the title character, is the only one who seems to be able to reach the daughter and bring her out of her shell. The dynamics of Tina and Whoopi's relationship are what give the movie a real special quality. Whoopi, as always, is a joy to watch. And I just can't say enough about Majorinos acting abilities at such a young age. She's simply a natural, and I'm totally shocked that her career didn't take off like it should have. She's unbelievable. Corrina, Corrina mixes just the right amounts of levity and drama to create a warm, heartfelt film that's easy to watch over and over again. There are just so many little moments that I can only describe as "adorable". I'm usually not so syrupy about films, but with this one I just can't help it. It never gets old.

    Corrina, Corrina (for IMDb) I stubbornly refuse to sneer at this 'period' film, which I think was not critically well received. Some of its themes are close to my heart  but even without this I'd be inclined to smile on such a gentle film, with such great  and such consistently miscast  actors. It's the early 60s (isn't it?) and newly widowed Manny Singer (Ray Liotta, for once cast against type) is struggling to hold down a job as a jingles writer, while raising distraught daughter Molly on his own. (** Very minor spoilers from here**) He employs widow Corrina Washington, and their rocky road to an understanding, healing Molly along the way, is the subject of the film, played with gentle humour. The small pleasures go on and on: Whoopi Goldberg in a film quiet and sedate enough to be a fine showcase for her super-dry wit; Ray Liotta, such a charismatic actor, finally getting to play a good guy, not a wise guy; the lovely child actress Tina Majorino, our eyes and ears in this film; the delightful ice cream hues, shot lovingly by serious cinematographer Bruce Surtees (much favoured by Clint Eastwood I believe); the elegiac inclusion of Don Ameche at the very end of his life; the supporting cast including the wonderful Curtis Williams as Percy. I could go on. All right, so in truth, not a lot happens; so the story isn't very original, more a hymn to a rosily remembered Jewish American childhood than great cinema - but so what? It's a pure pleasure to watch. Only one thing bothers me, given the interesting subtext of the film (**small spoiler**): why exactly, in 1994, did they need to make the kiss take place in near-total darkness (some 30 years after the period depicted in this film)? And whose decision was that?

    I love the start of the movie: Feet and shoes of people in the funeral. We do not know how the mother died. They do not tell and we do not really need. I like movies that does not give excess information. It is also beautifully tangent with race issues without poking our eyes about it. Children's part in the movie was extra beautiful! There is a wonderful scene that starts with the gospel song "This little light of mine" where black and white kids are on the tree and asking each other "Do you taste like chocolate?" and the other asks "Do you taste like vanilla?" and then they lick each other to see. This is not just a cute movie but also simply substantial.

    Engaging, sweet natured comedy-drama from writer/producer/director Jessie Nelson. Story tells of a widower whose recent loss sees him hiring a maid/nanny to help keep house and mind his young daughter. The catch is Corrina is African-American, and when the two become close, society frowns. This is the fifties folks. Nelson balances his film well, and shows an obvious love of children as he indulges in several cute scenes. Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta turn in serviceable performances, but it is Tina Majorino who steals the show as the lovable ragamuffin who doesn't understand why Mommy isn't coming back. Don Ameche and Joan Cusack appear briefly. Rick Cox's enjoyable score is based upon themes composed by Thomas Newman. Editor Lee Percy has allowed "Corrina, Corrina" to overstay its welcome just a little bit, but otherwise this is a touching, simple heart-warmer from Jessie Nelson that comes recommended to family audiences.

    Here's example number 87,358 of Hollywood's anti-Biblical bias, so typical of them. Early on, Ray Liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of Bible study ever day." This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. Once again, the Bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. That woman, of course, is dismissed immediately. Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil&agrave;, saves the day! Yawn.

    This is one of the few movies (in my opinion) that 'gets' what she can do... Most of her work is comedic, and her comedy chops are definitely evident, but the connection she makes with this family shows the love of a child and a man (who just happen to be white) during a time when it was (even potentially hazardous if not) unorthodox to have an interracial relationship. I have to admit that I've only seen this movie on cable, and when they show it on (I think TBS) they cut out the "N" word at a time that makes the scene make no sense. But I stop dead in my tracks to watch... The daughter is confronted as a "N" lover. She reailzes that the word means a black person, but she does not realize that the word is a racial slur. As far as she is concerned, she is with the people who love her, and she loves them, in the pure way that it seems only children can love, in return. These omissions are an example to me of how some networks, and more broadly a Black actress(I've heard her say that she doesn't like the term "African American"-"we're ALL Americans" I seem to remember...) is missplaced even in this decade. The Oscar win is not a fluke. Hollywood has yet to face or offer an opportunity that truly shows off her full potential. I feel that her peer is Robin Williams in terms of a comedian that Hollywood still has yet to see their potential.

    "Corrina Corrina" is very much a film of the 1990s set in the 1950s. Miss Goldberg uses her tried and trusted "Feisty Black Woman" schtick but it doesn't sit well in a movie set in an era when,whether we like it or not,black people behaved very differently amongst white people. The Little Rock desegregation episode occurred as late as 1957 and the Civil Rights marches were some time in the future,few blacks felt secure enough to go against the wishes of their white employers or even cuss and swear in their presence. Clearly there is a strong political edge to this movie,it could hardly be otherwise given our current obsession with racial and religious tensions both in the U.S and the U.K.Black Christian woman and white atheist Jew fall in love - I'm not sure how convincingly - but conveniently,for the very basis of the movie is that love laughs at locksmiths.Would that it were true. From "Romeo and Juliet" onwards playwrights have been telling us it isn't,but we're still clinging on to the hope. A few remarkable people succeeded in ignoring the social pressures,but even in the 21st century race and religion are barriers that can prove insurmountable. Commendably, in "Corrina Corrina" nobody pretends it's going to be easy for Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg.It is a measure of the film's effectiveness that I felt concerned for their future. There is some wonderful music,we hear Louis Armstrong and Oscar Peterson doing "You go to my head" and Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg duet Bill Evans' "Peace piece" on the piano quite delightfully.The title of the film is derived from an old blues song. Despite the caveat of my first paragraph I did enjoy this movie. As the lights went up I realised that hope springs eternal in the human breast - even mine.

The infrequent injections of Goldberg's comedy enable the film to be not just a sadistic and morbid tale of the hardships of America's shame, but an attempt to remind audiences that we have finally reached a place of equality where interracial love is acceptable. Goldberg's character is utilized as a tool to encourage mediation between the lost Manny and his daughter Overall, Corrina, Corrina is a truly beautiful film that raises the question of African-Americans being accepted into white society and serves a message to illustrate the history of America's black peoples and how, really, we're all the same.

    i was very surprised at the low rating for this film, however when you read the reviews there is very little negative comments. A little 4 year old girl/father lose their mother/wife in the sixties in America. the little girl is so traumatised by the loss of her mother that she becomes mute. the father is not sensitive enough to her emotional distress to be able to help her. Enter Whoopi Goldberg as a nanny who through emotional literacy and counselling skills/ or good mum skills whatever you want to call it is able to heal the girl. the other theme dealt with is the obvious issue of racism and cross cultural love: a beautiful little film, good acting well dealt with enjoy will

    I've not read many bad reviews for this film, and when I do it's usually someone whining and complaining about Hollywoods liberal agenda and how this film is simply a poor manifestation of that. Sorry but not every film about controversial subjects has to have a hidden agenda. I strongly suspect it's something else entirely, mainly the fact that a White male and a Black woman have a romance and certain narrow-minded people don't like to see that. They don't come right out and say this, but instead blame it on typical "Hollywood liberalism". I don't agree. I think the writers had a story to tell, and this just so happened to be the subject matter. And what a wonderful little story it is. It tells the story of how a widower, played by Ray Liotta, and his daughter (Tina Majorino) who are trying to pick up the pieces of their life after the death of the mother (who by the way is never shown in the film). Ray Liotta immediately begins looking for a nanny to watch after his daughter so he can return to work. Whoopi Goldberg, who plays the title character, is the only one who seems to be able to reach the daughter and bring her out of her shell. The dynamics of Tina and Whoopi's relationship are what give the movie a real special quality. Whoopi, as always, is a joy to watch. And I just can't say enough about Majorinos acting abilities at such a young age. She's simply a natural, and I'm totally shocked that her career didn't take off like it should have. She's unbelievable. Corrina, Corrina mixes just the right amounts of levity and drama to create a warm, heartfelt film that's easy to watch over and over again. There are just so many little moments that I can only describe as "adorable". I'm usually not so syrupy about films, but with this one I just can't help it. It never gets old.

    Corrina, Corrina (for IMDb) I stubbornly refuse to sneer at this 'period' film, which I think was not critically well received. Some of its themes are close to my heart  but even without this I'd be inclined to smile on such a gentle film, with such great  and such consistently miscast  actors. It's the early 60s (isn't it?) and newly widowed Manny Singer (Ray Liotta, for once cast against type) is struggling to hold down a job as a jingles writer, while raising distraught daughter Molly on his own. (** Very minor spoilers from here**) He employs widow Corrina Washington, and their rocky road to an understanding, healing Molly along the way, is the subject of the film, played with gentle humour. The small pleasures go on and on: Whoopi Goldberg in a film quiet and sedate enough to be a fine showcase for her super-dry wit; Ray Liotta, such a charismatic actor, finally getting to play a good guy, not a wise guy; the lovely child actress Tina Majorino, our eyes and ears in this film; the delightful ice cream hues, shot lovingly by serious cinematographer Bruce Surtees (much favoured by Clint Eastwood I believe); the elegiac inclusion of Don Ameche at the very end of his life; the supporting cast including the wonderful Curtis Williams as Percy. I could go on. All right, so in truth, not a lot happens; so the story isn't very original, more a hymn to a rosily remembered Jewish American childhood than great cinema - but so what? It's a pure pleasure to watch. Only one thing bothers me, given the interesting subtext of the film (**small spoiler**): why exactly, in 1994, did they need to make the kiss take place in near-total darkness (some 30 years after the period depicted in this film)? And whose decision was that?

    I love the start of the movie: Feet and shoes of people in the funeral. We do not know how the mother died. They do not tell and we do not really need. I like movies that does not give excess information. It is also beautifully tangent with race issues without poking our eyes about it. Children's part in the movie was extra beautiful! There is a wonderful scene that starts with the gospel song "This little light of mine" where black and white kids are on the tree and asking each other "Do you taste like chocolate?" and the other asks "Do you taste like vanilla?" and then they lick each other to see. This is not just a cute movie but also simply substantial.

    Engaging, sweet natured comedy-drama from writer/producer/director Jessie Nelson. Story tells of a widower whose recent loss sees him hiring a maid/nanny to help keep house and mind his young daughter. The catch is Corrina is African-American, and when the two become close, society frowns. This is the fifties folks. Nelson balances his film well, and shows an obvious love of children as he indulges in several cute scenes. Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta turn in serviceable performances, but it is Tina Majorino who steals the show as the lovable ragamuffin who doesn't understand why Mommy isn't coming back. Don Ameche and Joan Cusack appear briefly. Rick Cox's enjoyable score is based upon themes composed by Thomas Newman. Editor Lee Percy has allowed "Corrina, Corrina" to overstay its welcome just a little bit, but otherwise this is a touching, simple heart-warmer from Jessie Nelson that comes recommended to family audiences.

    Here's example number 87,358 of Hollywood's anti-Biblical bias, so typical of them. Early on, Ray Liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of Bible study ever day." This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. Once again, the Bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. That woman, of course, is dismissed immediately. Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil&agrave;, saves the day! Yawn.

    This is one of the few movies (in my opinion) that 'gets' what she can do... Most of her work is comedic, and her comedy chops are definitely evident, but the connection she makes with this family shows the love of a child and a man (who just happen to be white) during a time when it was (even potentially hazardous if not) unorthodox to have an interracial relationship. I have to admit that I've only seen this movie on cable, and when they show it on (I think TBS) they cut out the "N" word at a time that makes the scene make no sense. But I stop dead in my tracks to watch... The daughter is confronted as a "N" lover. She reailzes that the word means a black person, but she does not realize that the word is a racial slur. As far as she is concerned, she is with the people who love her, and she loves them, in the pure way that it seems only children can love, in return. These omissions are an example to me of how some networks, and more broadly a Black actress(I've heard her say that she doesn't like the term "African American"-"we're ALL Americans" I seem to remember...) is missplaced even in this decade. The Oscar win is not a fluke. Hollywood has yet to face or offer an opportunity that truly shows off her full potential. I feel that her peer is Robin Williams in terms of a comedian that Hollywood still has yet to see their potential.

    "Corrina Corrina" is very much a film of the 1990s set in the 1950s. Miss Goldberg uses her tried and trusted "Feisty Black Woman" schtick but it doesn't sit well in a movie set in an era when,whether we like it or not,black people behaved very differently amongst white people. The Little Rock desegregation episode occurred as late as 1957 and the Civil Rights marches were some time in the future,few blacks felt secure enough to go against the wishes of their white employers or even cuss and swear in their presence. Clearly there is a strong political edge to this movie,it could hardly be otherwise given our current obsession with racial and religious tensions both in the U.S and the U.K.Black Christian woman and white atheist Jew fall in love - I'm not sure how convincingly - but conveniently,for the very basis of the movie is that love laughs at locksmiths.Would that it were true. From "Romeo and Juliet" onwards playwrights have been telling us it isn't,but we're still clinging on to the hope. A few remarkable people succeeded in ignoring the social pressures,but even in the 21st century race and religion are barriers that can prove insurmountable. Commendably, in "Corrina Corrina" nobody pretends it's going to be easy for Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg.It is a measure of the film's effectiveness that I felt concerned for their future. There is some wonderful music,we hear Louis Armstrong and Oscar Peterson doing "You go to my head" and Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg duet Bill Evans' "Peace piece" on the piano quite delightfully.The title of the film is derived from an old blues song. Despite the caveat of my first paragraph I did enjoy this movie. As the lights went up I realised that hope springs eternal in the human breast - even mine.

    CORRINA, CORRINA ****1/2 Jesse Nelson produces, directs, and writes this heartwarming, thoughtful tale set in 1950s suburbia, where Whoopi Goldberg starts working for an emotionally damaged family by taking care of the single Dad's daughter. The unfolding and flow of each act is smooth-flowing and properly paced as Goldberg positively impacts the family - from the point where the mute-by-choice daughter starts talking again, to Goldberg becoming romantically involved with Dad - that will bring a smile to your face and joy to your heart. It's one of those films that achieves as a great drama yet is also very comical at the right times, and is laced with social commentary, adding more depth.
