    While I consider "Bananas", "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex*, But We're Afraid To Ask", "Sleeper", and "Love & Death" as hugely entertaining films; "Annie Hall" is definitely a cut above most of the work he's done, and it's one of his best along with "Manhattan". The film is a story about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in a relationship. There are a lot of clever and humorous moments, and it makes the film more interesting to watch. We see Allen's character telling us about his childhood in a child's perspective. I really enjoyed this film, and I can say that it reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally", regarding the love and drama in a relationship's comedy. Very highly recommended. 10/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie thoroughly deserves an 8 or a more than that rating. This movie is unlike other over the top love stories which you experience otherwise. This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love. Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives. Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence. I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts. But this movie is certainly worth repeated watch.

    In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like "la di da" and "grammy". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!

    Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outr&eacute; characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling. Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world? Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film. Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films."Why not just steer clear of them?" you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.

    Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film. Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.

    Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films. Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end. Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible. Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason. Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy. As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing. Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.

    This movie's more of a documentary then a movie. A guy tells us his recent history with women, and characters frequently break the fourth wall, looking in on each other's flashbacks. Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that? You're trying to go through your place of living, only to have people ride, rumble, and make a whole lot of noise going over your house! Not too great an ending, either.

    While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many "rom-coms" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and "Annie Hall" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, "Annie Hall" is a perfect choice!

    Woody Allen seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityif only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!

    Woody Allen seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityif only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!

    While I consider "Bananas", "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex*, But We're Afraid To Ask", "Sleeper", and "Love & Death" as hugely entertaining films; "Annie Hall" is definitely a cut above most of the work he's done, and it's one of his best along with "Manhattan". The film is a story about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in a relationship. There are a lot of clever and humorous moments, and it makes the film more interesting to watch. We see Allen's character telling us about his childhood in a child's perspective. I really enjoyed this film, and I can say that it reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally", regarding the love and drama in a relationship's comedy. Very highly recommended. 10/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie thoroughly deserves an 8 or a more than that rating. This movie is unlike other over the top love stories which you experience otherwise. This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love. Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives. Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence. I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts. But this movie is certainly worth repeated watch.

    In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like "la di da" and "grammy". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!

    Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outr&eacute; characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling. Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world? Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film. Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films."Why not just steer clear of them?" you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.

    Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film. Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.

    Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films. Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end. Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible. Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason. Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy. As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing. Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.

    This movie's more of a documentary then a movie. A guy tells us his recent history with women, and characters frequently break the fourth wall, looking in on each other's flashbacks. Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that? You're trying to go through your place of living, only to have people ride, rumble, and make a whole lot of noise going over your house! Not too great an ending, either.

    While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many "rom-coms" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and "Annie Hall" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, "Annie Hall" is a perfect choice!

    While I consider "Bananas", "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex*, But We're Afraid To Ask", "Sleeper", and "Love & Death" as hugely entertaining films; "Annie Hall" is definitely a cut above most of the work he's done, and it's one of his best along with "Manhattan". The film is a story about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in a relationship. There are a lot of clever and humorous moments, and it makes the film more interesting to watch. We see Allen's character telling us about his childhood in a child's perspective. I really enjoyed this film, and I can say that it reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally", regarding the love and drama in a relationship's comedy. Very highly recommended. 10/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie thoroughly deserves an 8 or a more than that rating. This movie is unlike other over the top love stories which you experience otherwise. This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love. Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives. Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence. I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts. But this movie is certainly worth repeated watch.

    In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like "la di da" and "grammy". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!

    Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outr&eacute; characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling. Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world? Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film. Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films."Why not just steer clear of them?" you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.

    Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film. Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.

    Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films. Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end. Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible. Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason. Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy. As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing. Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.

    This movie's more of a documentary then a movie. A guy tells us his recent history with women, and characters frequently break the fourth wall, looking in on each other's flashbacks. Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that? You're trying to go through your place of living, only to have people ride, rumble, and make a whole lot of noise going over your house! Not too great an ending, either.

    While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many "rom-coms" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and "Annie Hall" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, "Annie Hall" is a perfect choice!

    Woody Allen seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityif only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!

I really enjoyed this film, and I can say that it reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally", regarding the love and drama in a relationship's comedy. Very highly recommended. 10/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie thoroughly deserves an 8 or a more than that rating. This movie is unlike other over the top love stories which you experience otherwise. This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love. Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives. Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence. I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts. But this movie is certainly worth repeated watch.

    In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like "la di da" and "grammy". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!

    Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outr&eacute; characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling. Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world? Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film. Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films."Why not just steer clear of them?" you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.

    Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film. Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.

    Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films. Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end. Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible. Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason. Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy. As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing. Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.

    This movie's more of a documentary then a movie. A guy tells us his recent history with women, and characters frequently break the fourth wall, looking in on each other's flashbacks. Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that? You're trying to go through your place of living, only to have people ride, rumble, and make a whole lot of noise going over your house! Not too great an ending, either.

    While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many "rom-coms" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and "Annie Hall" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, "Annie Hall" is a perfect choice!

    Woody Allen seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityif only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!

    While I consider "Bananas", "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex*, But We're Afraid To Ask", "Sleeper", and "Love & Death" as hugely entertaining films; "Annie Hall" is definitely a cut above most of the work he's done, and it's one of his best along with "Manhattan". The film is a story about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in a relationship. There are a lot of clever and humorous moments, and it makes the film more interesting to watch.

This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love. Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives. Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence. I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts. But this movie is certainly worth repeated watch.

    In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like "la di da" and "grammy". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!

    Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outr&eacute; characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling. Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world? Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film. Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films."Why not just steer clear of them?" you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.

    Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film. Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.

    Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films. Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end. Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible. Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason. Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy. As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing. Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.

    This movie's more of a documentary then a movie. A guy tells us his recent history with women, and characters frequently break the fourth wall, looking in on each other's flashbacks. Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that? You're trying to go through your place of living, only to have people ride, rumble, and make a whole lot of noise going over your house! Not too great an ending, either.

    While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many "rom-coms" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and "Annie Hall" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, "Annie Hall" is a perfect choice!

    Woody Allen seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityif only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!

    While I consider "Bananas", "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex*, But We're Afraid To Ask", "Sleeper", and "Love & Death" as hugely entertaining films; "Annie Hall" is definitely a cut above most of the work he's done, and it's one of his best along with "Manhattan". The film is a story about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in a relationship. There are a lot of clever and humorous moments, and it makes the film more interesting to watch. We see Allen's character telling us about his childhood in a child's perspective. I really enjoyed this film, and I can say that it reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's "When Harry Met Sally", regarding the love and drama in a relationship's comedy. Very highly recommended. 10/10 Written By Alienator Donut.
