    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me."

The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

    Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with "The Writer"(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.

    Stand By Me is a fantastic move with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast.The movie is very heartfelt,sweet and also very funny at times,it is a great 'coming of age', film as these four boys slowly mature while they head off on a journey together in search of a dead body.The four boys were perfect casting,young children usually aren't great actors because their not experienced enough,but these four were and the dialog between the characters is brilliant,its very honest to how children at this age actually speak,the best performance has to go to Will Wheaton,an actor I have always enjoyed,but I only knew he was Gordie after watching it and was very surprised that he was so great at such a young age.Stand By Me is a great film with great character development that I would highly recommend to fans of both Stephen King and Rob Reiner. A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment. I feel that for every part in this movie there is something to be learned. And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.

A man looks back on his childhood after one of his close friends dies,back when they,along with two other friends,head off on a quest find a dead body.

    What's great about acclaimed writer Stephen King is his diversity in his works. He may be regarded as the "master of horror," but not every novel put out by this author is not a suspenseful horror thriller. King has put out many smaller novels and novellas in addition to classics like "Carrie," "The Shining," and "The Stand." One of his best non-horror books is "Different Seasons," a collection of four novellas that focus on drama rather than horror. Three of the novellas were adapted to film, one of them being "The Body." Renamed Stand by Me when adapted to film, the movie is a masterful book-to-movie adaptation, with a simple yet effective story, extremely well-written and well acted characters, and a perfect recreation of the late 1950s. Stand by Me follows four twelve year old boys as they follow the railroad tracks of Castle Rock, Oregon, looking for a dead body which has not been recovered. Each of the four boys has a quirk or flaw to them. Gordie Lachance, the main protagonist of the story, is emotionally scarred from the death of his brother and the lack of attention from his parents. Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, a wrongly accused criminal from a family of alcoholics and criminals. Teddy Duchamp is the fun loving member of the bunch, but he's physically scarred by his mentally insane father. Vern Tessio, Teddy's best friend, is overweight and picked on by the boys, usually in good fun, of course. Along their trip, the boys encounter several small trials that test them physically, as well as emotionally. One of the main trials is a gang of older bullies and thugs, led by "Ace" Merrill. Ace and his crew are also looking for the body in order to be town heroes. These trials teach the four young boys about the importance of friendship, as well as the inevitable realism of growing up and entering adulthood. The fact that the story is so simple and relatable makes it all the more charming. Stephen King's novella was perfectly adapted to the screen by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, earning the duo an often overlooked Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The themes of growing up and facing adulthood are some that everyone goes through at some point, so it's simple to relate to the characters and their reactions. Even better, the movie is even more relatable as viewers age upon watching the movie, realizing that there was so much that was right about the thoughts of adulthood and growing up. The well-written story was acted perfectly by four amazing young talents. Wil Wheaton's Gordie Lachance was really well done, garnering Wheaton his widespread acclaim as an actor. Wheaton was relatable, emotional, and charming. Corey Feldman plays an absolutely hilarious Teddy Duchamp, but does so without diluting the charm of his character. Jerry O'Connell's performance as Vern Tessio is probably the weakest of the four, but he is still quite a likable and funny character. The real scene stealer, without a doubt, is the late River Phoenix as Chris Chambers. Every time his character speaks, it's near impossible not to relate to what he has to say. Phoenix brings everything he has to the role, often leaving you on the verge of crying. The icing on the delicious cake is the fact that director Rob Reiner was able to create a perfectly constructed atmosphere of the 1950s. Everything from the hairstyles and outfits to the cars all match the decade very well. What matches it perfectly, however, is the soundtrack. Songs like The Chordettes' "Lollipop," The Coasters' "Yakety Yak," Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire," and the inspiration of the movie's title itself, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me." Stand by Me is a perfect book-to-movie adaptation. Rob Reiner adapted King's novella with fantastic charisma, making the film relatable, charming, funny, and emotional to everyone. The script is satisfying well-written, and perfectly acted by the quartet of young actors, and a well made atmosphere that recreated the 1950s. Stand by Me stands as one of the best coming-of-age movies, one of the best book-to-movie adaptations, and one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.

    Stephen King's "Stand by Me," is a movie about friendship and the freedom and innocence of adolescence. The main characters in the movie are Gordie Lechance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp. Each one of them have imperfect lives that perfectly reveal who they are and how they act. Chris Chambers is the hard nosed kid in the friendship. The way that he talks about his father and the fact that he smokes suggests that he lives a hard life and that he is thought of badly by his peers. Gordie Lechance is the leader in the friendship. Gordie struggles with the emotional gap that he cant seem to fill in between him and his parents. You will find out why his parents have gone astray from him once you get later on into the movie. Vern Tessio is the gullible klutz of the group. He is often seen being teased by the other 3 boys. And last but not least Teddy Duchamp. Teddy is the free spirited member of the group that is crazy and likes to take risks. But don't let that fool you, behind all of his smiles and jokes there is a wall of emotion just waiting to cave in. When I watched this movie I felt that there was never a dull moment.

And for that, "Stand by Me," has easily become one of my favorite films and it will be of great benefit to those who watch it.

    After the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy. From director Rob Reiner comes Stand By Me, an excellent and touching film that is one of the most moving films that I have ever seen. I was expecting to see something great, and I got something more than great, I ended up seeing something absolutely wonderful. I surprised at the way the movie turned out. This proves that Stephen King is an outstanding writer, he can write other genres besides horror, as he also wrote what would later be adapted into The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile. Sure, this movie has a few differences from the original story, but otherwise, it is pretty faithful to the source. The acting is outstanding, seriously, this is some of the best acting out of any movie that I have seen in quite some time. Reiner is a genius. He can direct hysterical comedies like The Princess Bride, to courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men, and touching coming of age movies like Stand By Me. As I said previously, the acting is simply outstanding. Everyone in the movie played their parts perfectly. Wil Wheaton was wonderful as Gordie Lachance, the late River Phoenix is marvelous as Chris Chambers, Corey Feldman is stellar as Teddy Duchamp, and Jerry O'Connell is superb as Vern Tessio. And let's not forget the always fabulous Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the writer that narrates the story. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie. But perhaps the most moving scene is the scene where Gordie is having a break down when he feels that his father loved his older brother more than he did Gordie. That scene is very moving, as it is able to reach out to the audience. As a matter of fact, the whole movie reaches out to the audience with it's humorous moments and it's heartwarming and even tear-jerking moments. I definitely rate this movie as one of the best movies of 1986, and one of Reiner's best. Stand By Me is a touching tale of love and friendship, at times it's funny, at times it's tear-jerking, and at times, it is heartwarming. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie a second time, I would do it, as it is truly a wonderful film. Everyone involved with the production of this film deserves credit for all of their work. I send my applauds to every actor for their outstanding performances in the film, and I send my posthumous applauds to River Phoenix, who did tragically at the age of 23. The movie is wonderful from the very minute that it starts to the very minute that it ends, not one single second of the movie is wasted. All I am going to say now is that if you have not seen this film, then you've got to do so, as you will be astounded by what you will be seeing. Stand By Me is one of the best Coming Of Age movies that anybody will ever see. 10/10

    Stand by Me is based off of a Stephen King book called the Body, and is a classic with its cast and the story of them on their journey to see a dead body. So many things are wonderful to see and not one moment wasted. The film is about a group of four friends who are told by Vern that a dead body is down by the lake and is apparently missing and could make them famous. They decide to go and we witness their friendship as well as some exciting chase scenes from a train and see their relationship with one another. The kids in this film are a real delight. They are Chris, the leader of the group and is the bad kid who has a bad reputation and has a crummy life back home, Vern, a chubby fat kid who is cautious, but likes hanging around with his friends, Ted, the glasses kid but is kind of crazy as he acts like he is having an adventure and does the daring at times while sometimes fighting, and last, Gordie, a humble kid who is best friends with Chris, lost his brother and hates his life back home and likes going on adventures with his friends and is the main character as his older self is the one telling the story. The films has a great climax as there is a bully named Ace, who is a fair bit older then the kids and they killed the body and now want to fake it and say they found it and get the credit but run into the kids as they were already there. He is about to knife Chris who won't move away from the dead body when Gordie shoots a gun and threatens him as he leaves them, then they do a different choice and make an anonymous phone call saying where the dead body is. The film is my favorite King film and is one ranks up there with To Kill a Mockingbird with films about kids. Me: 5/5 Audience: 4.05/5

    Stand By Me a nostalgic remembrance of a friendship between four twelve year old boys, during a period when they're just young enough to talk about cartoons and be afraid of the dark, and old enough to use cuss words and smoke cigarettes, and their biggest childhood adventure. They all have their own emotional problems and that's what makes their friendship so endearing to the viewer. The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella "The Body" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10.

    I'm from Japan and I love this movie. Four young people who are friends with each other set out for adventure in order to look for a missing body. WIll Wheaton plays Gordie Lanchance. He stood out as an actor in stand by me but he has almost only appeared on TV dramas since then. River Phoenix played Chris Chambers. His death, because of taking so many drugs, was surprising. its too bad. Jerry O'connell played Vern Tessio. Since then He has become thin and looks handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ace Merrill. I didn't realize Kiefer Sutherland was in this movie until checking IMDb. This movie is not only funny and exciting but also recalls something like our childhood memories. I think this movie is suitable for men of more than eighteen years old because women don't so much experience such adventures. I hardly watch real life drama movies and I usually don't like such movies. however this film makes me recall my own childhood so I watch it over and over again. This movie contains unique phrases in English. For example Gordie says "piss up a rope" This word is said with resignation. I also like "walking talking Jesus". my favorite expression in the movie is "two for flinching" this expresses a punishment because of getting scared. that is why Vern Tessio is hit by Teddy Duchamp, over and over again. i love this movie i think it is as good a movie as I have ever watched.

    Stand By Me is one of those movies which in the end leaves you with some tears in your eyes. Its excellent plot and acting makes this movie perfect, although I would not call this the greatest movie ever made I definitely think it deserves a better rating than 8,1. Its another movie where somebody retells a part of his life, usually these kinds of movies can either turn into a disaster or masterpiece. Gordie Lachance played by Wil Wheaton is a boy who lives in a small town, hes in a gang with three others, his best friend Chris Chambers who comes from a bad family, the crazy Teddy Duchamp and the last one in the gang Vern Tessio. All four have some trouble in their families. One day Vern tells the gang about a dead body in a forest outside of town, and they decide to try to find this body. I wont tell you more of the plot, but I can say it is just magnificent, and in the end it just leaves a mark in your heart. The detailed but short plot makes you feel like one of them and makes you wish the movies tragic ending wont end. Its a great masterpiece, as most of the great movies out there Stand By Me is based on Stephen Kings novel The Body. I really recommend this movie to anyone, it is very emotional, it has a great plot combined with the excellent acting. This movie deserves a better rating than it already has.
