 <sinopse>
  Tommy is an unemployed mechanic who spends most of his time in a bar (Trees Lounge) in a small blue collar town. He seems to always be thinking, "If only X then I could stop drinking".
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Things aren't going so well for Tommy Basilio. He lost his job because he "borrowed" money from the register, his girlfriend left him for his boss and is now pregnant, and he can't find work because of the incident. His life revolves around the Trees Lounge, a neighborhood bar over which he lives, full of the colorful eccentrics one finds in such places, like the estranged husband, or the old boozer drinking himself to death. He drunkenly wanders through his life, still in love with his ex, desperate for some sort of meaning beyond the bar, some sort of meaning to his life.

    Loved it.... While not especially dark, this film really captures the lingering malaise that is a working life in the New York area burbs. If you spent any time growing up, living in the area you know a place like the "Trees Lounge" that is populated by "townies" that sort of never leave. I won't write a review of the performances/script other than it is a great "capture." Highly recommended -- especially for those that love theater as well. Stellar all around - glad I caught it on Netflix. You may very well want to watch this flick as a warning tale as well. You already know everyone in the film!

    This is a tale of a jobless deceitful Tommy Basilio who never took anything seriously in his life, including himself. Therefore he lost his love and present, lost having a dream or a tomorrow. At one moment he says "Everybody is lost. But nobody says that about himself !" That guy lives above a bar, (and in it !). After 8 years of affair, his girl goes to his boss; who deserves her more, since he achieves himself, and planed his tomorrow. Now we follow the features of that 40 year old teen's aberration; a caprice with a teen girl that equals his adolescence, being too cowered to admit that he's a loser, his torn connections with everybody, his incapacity to have any kind of balanced human relationship.. So that's why he begged a touch of hand from the girl who danced with him (who drunkenly slept before requesting any physical love from her side). The movie managed to embody the statues of some people from that loser town as well; the dancing woman is unhappily married, the company's owner  who goes constantly to the bar  is irresponsible towards his wife and kids,.. etc. As you see, everybody is a drunken adolescent who has no hope for getting out of their stalemate or that town, along with those rotten invariable values; such as negativism, laziness and separation, that they imprisoned themselves in. The funniest thing is the lead's transforming at the end to a twin for the old drunken man who used to sit in the bar for all the time like a corpse. It insinuated that he'll meet the same fate; turning into a lonely aged, no talker no listener, frozen sot who "Will wake up someday, not breathing !" There are some clever scenes. 2 of them are unforgettable. The first is when the lead's ex-lover was re-watching his old home video. Look how the movie's camera goes beyond the TV's screen, to live the good memories. Maybe because the frivolous past of a character like Tommy is his present and future. Or maybe because these memories have some hot feelings that still alive inside that tape, and that lover who deplores Tommy as lost or determined on being lost. The second scene is when the lead sees his ex-love after giving birth to a baby. He understood there that he can't push the time back to win what he resolved to lose. And that the baby isn't his son; whether due to how he can't give life, even for himself !, or due to the fact that that baby would never have a life under his dead tree. This is surely the best climax for this movie. So when you read the tagline : "a story about one man's search... for who knows what.", you'll easily understand that his search is for an escape, away from his irresponsible self, or admitting it. I knew (Steve Buscemi) first as an extra in (Pulp Fiction), then as an always scary psychopath killer in movies like (Con Air) and (Some Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead). To an extent that in 1999, when Empire magazine published a reportage about the best 100 movies in history, the icon that they used to define the degree of bloodiness in every movie was a face so similar to his! So imagine my surprise to witness how he can act, write, and direct something distinct, serene, and not bloody such as this. I just hated the poster's line "Black Comedy". Clearly the term "Drama" is unprofitable or unpopular in America of the last decades ! There was no need for such a lie or for hiring big name like (Samuel L. Jackson) to do a useless cameo either. But these were some ways to market the movie in a market that mostly doesn't welcome anything except the holy : action and comedy flicks ! As a direction it's astonishingly simple and sensitively done. (Buscemi) did it without one second of allegation or exhausting technique. And as a script; it's subtle, bitter and enjoyable study for the anti-hero. In other words, sometimes a short novel bewitches me. Here's one of them.

    The depiction of the life of a man descending to lower levels is something you seldom see in movies. This movie is very realistic in its approach to the subject. Once a semi-respected man with a job, girlfriend and future, he now has to cope with the downfall and losing his community's respect for him. Steve Buscemi is the perfect actor to play the role -his portrayal is very believable. The movie has some comic moments to make its dark subject tolerable. If only this tormented guy could obtain something to raise his self-worth, be it getting his family back, his job back, or score a one-night stand, then he would be fine for the day. And if only he could stop chasing these things, embark on an inner journey and find where the problem lies. Or simply snort crack and imbibe to cope.

    As a week-in-the-life-of a 31-year-old man named Tommy (Steve Buscemi), an out-of-work auto mechanic, this film plods along drearily and monotonously. Tommy's life is a mess. He hangs out at a local Long Island bar, called the Trees Lounge, where he hobnobs with other neighborhood deadbeats. None of the characters here have anything going for them. They drink alcohol, smoke, and talk. They're frustrated, unhappy, angry, and in a lot of emotional pain. Some viewers would call them losers. They don't know how to adapt to life's changes. They can't see beyond the dreary little world they've boxed themselves into. Their perspective is too confining. The best scenes take place inside the bar, where depressing jukebox songs play in the background. Outside the bar, scenes are largely uninteresting and perfunctory. But they do add depth to the characters, if the viewer has any interest in them to begin with. Some scenes play like a soap opera of life's defeated. Pace is slow. Dialogue is voluminous. Superficially, Buscemi, bug-eyed and anemic looking, is something of a trial to watch. Yet, he's no less attractive than other actors here. And that's a welcome change from blow-dried, photogenic fashion models, right out of central casting, who populate so many mainstream films. Low-budget, and very low-concept, "Trees Lounge" is just the ticket for the viewer who is depressed, bored, or feeling blue. One can empathize with Tommy, or his cohorts, knowing that the story is semi-autobiographical of Buscemi, before he got into acting.

    After looking forward to seeing this movie directed ,written by and starring one of my favourite actors Steve Buscemi and with a big name cast I was left disappointed . This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldn't relate to and the relationships between all characters weren't believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating . Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .

    This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular Joe." Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is "Lonesome Jim.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "Lonesome Jim.". So enjoy!

    This movie was interesting. It is about a semi-alcoholic (Buscemi)who throws away his life hanging out at a local bar in a small town outside of New York City. I liked the way he was portrayed of being liked and despised at the same time. The main character obviously came from a well established Italian-American family in the community. So, people know and associate with him, but at the same time are wary of him because he appears to be a "loser". The main character was once a very good mechanic, but lost his job when he stole money from the garage's till. The owner (Lapaglia) is torn. He is guilt-ridden, because not only did he steal the main character's girlfriend, but also is sorry to see his former friend throwing away his life drinking at the local bar. I also like all the supporting cast. There is a great deal of sorrow displayed in this old man, who is obviously beyond hope. When the old man is finally dying, all the locals who pretended to like him at the bar really are discovered to have not cared at all. The things that detracted from the movie was that the main character was immature and irresponsible. It was hard to empathize with a guy who does drugs and sleeps with a seventeen year old girl. In addition, there was a lot of lack of clarity in the film. Who was the main character in relation to the ice cream man who suddenly died. He is obviously treated like a family member, but no explanation is given as to whom he actually is. If someone just said that is "the nephew", it would have resolved a lot of confusion. So, the movie was interesting, but suffered from a lack of empathy for the plight of the main character, and confusion about whom exactly he is. I would have liked to seen more shown to illustrate what led him to where he ended up as.

    This is real life stuff at its best. Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge. It was like I had my own barstool just watching what was going on. The character development is superb. Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi. You can almost feel that he is not really acting in this role...it feels more like he is re-living part of his life experience in the movie. It is a slice of life from the outskirts of NYC or Nothern NJ that seems like it would actually happen.

    Some guy loses his girlfriend, his job and now drinks all day in a boring bar. He then inherits an ice cream van from his deceased uncle and drives around the streets half-bored selling sweets. This is a perfect example that illustrates good actors don't necessarily make good films! The characters are weak, the story told a thousand times before and the complete luck of active plot makes the film suitable only for TV on a Sunday afternoon. Buscemi fails to push the actors to their limits resulting in a 'soap opera' style performance which is well below the average. Most of the scenes were pointless and contributed nothing to the film. Trees Lounge could have started straight after Tommy inherited the Van (thirty minutes before the end) and still wouldn't make any difference! If you do end up watching the film just imagine how the film would be like if Tarantino directed it. Better watch TV commercials :(

    From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Tree's Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Tree's Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.

    Some guy loses his girlfriend, his job and now drinks all day in a boring bar. He then inherits an ice cream van from his deceased uncle and drives around the streets half-bored selling sweets. This is a perfect example that illustrates good actors don't necessarily make good films! The characters are weak, the story told a thousand times before and the complete luck of active plot makes the film suitable only for TV on a Sunday afternoon. Buscemi fails to push the actors to their limits resulting in a 'soap opera' style performance which is well below the average. Most of the scenes were pointless and contributed nothing to the film. Trees Lounge could have started straight after Tommy inherited the Van (thirty minutes before the end) and still wouldn't make any difference! If you do end up watching the film just imagine how the film would be like if Tarantino directed it. Better watch TV commercials :(

    From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Tree's Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Tree's Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.

    Loved it.... While not especially dark, this film really captures the lingering malaise that is a working life in the New York area burbs. If you spent any time growing up, living in the area you know a place like the "Trees Lounge" that is populated by "townies" that sort of never leave. I won't write a review of the performances/script other than it is a great "capture." Highly recommended -- especially for those that love theater as well. Stellar all around - glad I caught it on Netflix. You may very well want to watch this flick as a warning tale as well. You already know everyone in the film!

    This is a tale of a jobless deceitful Tommy Basilio who never took anything seriously in his life, including himself. Therefore he lost his love and present, lost having a dream or a tomorrow. At one moment he says "Everybody is lost. But nobody says that about himself !" That guy lives above a bar, (and in it !). After 8 years of affair, his girl goes to his boss; who deserves her more, since he achieves himself, and planed his tomorrow. Now we follow the features of that 40 year old teen's aberration; a caprice with a teen girl that equals his adolescence, being too cowered to admit that he's a loser, his torn connections with everybody, his incapacity to have any kind of balanced human relationship.. So that's why he begged a touch of hand from the girl who danced with him (who drunkenly slept before requesting any physical love from her side). The movie managed to embody the statues of some people from that loser town as well; the dancing woman is unhappily married, the company's owner  who goes constantly to the bar  is irresponsible towards his wife and kids,.. etc. As you see, everybody is a drunken adolescent who has no hope for getting out of their stalemate or that town, along with those rotten invariable values; such as negativism, laziness and separation, that they imprisoned themselves in. The funniest thing is the lead's transforming at the end to a twin for the old drunken man who used to sit in the bar for all the time like a corpse. It insinuated that he'll meet the same fate; turning into a lonely aged, no talker no listener, frozen sot who "Will wake up someday, not breathing !" There are some clever scenes. 2 of them are unforgettable. The first is when the lead's ex-lover was re-watching his old home video. Look how the movie's camera goes beyond the TV's screen, to live the good memories. Maybe because the frivolous past of a character like Tommy is his present and future. Or maybe because these memories have some hot feelings that still alive inside that tape, and that lover who deplores Tommy as lost or determined on being lost. The second scene is when the lead sees his ex-love after giving birth to a baby. He understood there that he can't push the time back to win what he resolved to lose. And that the baby isn't his son; whether due to how he can't give life, even for himself !, or due to the fact that that baby would never have a life under his dead tree. This is surely the best climax for this movie. So when you read the tagline : "a story about one man's search... for who knows what.", you'll easily understand that his search is for an escape, away from his irresponsible self, or admitting it. I knew (Steve Buscemi) first as an extra in (Pulp Fiction), then as an always scary psychopath killer in movies like (Con Air) and (Some Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead). To an extent that in 1999, when Empire magazine published a reportage about the best 100 movies in history, the icon that they used to define the degree of bloodiness in every movie was a face so similar to his! So imagine my surprise to witness how he can act, write, and direct something distinct, serene, and not bloody such as this. I just hated the poster's line "Black Comedy". Clearly the term "Drama" is unprofitable or unpopular in America of the last decades ! There was no need for such a lie or for hiring big name like (Samuel L. Jackson) to do a useless cameo either. But these were some ways to market the movie in a market that mostly doesn't welcome anything except the holy : action and comedy flicks ! As a direction it's astonishingly simple and sensitively done. (Buscemi) did it without one second of allegation or exhausting technique. And as a script; it's subtle, bitter and enjoyable study for the anti-hero. In other words, sometimes a short novel bewitches me. Here's one of them.

    The depiction of the life of a man descending to lower levels is something you seldom see in movies. This movie is very realistic in its approach to the subject. Once a semi-respected man with a job, girlfriend and future, he now has to cope with the downfall and losing his community's respect for him. Steve Buscemi is the perfect actor to play the role -his portrayal is very believable. The movie has some comic moments to make its dark subject tolerable. If only this tormented guy could obtain something to raise his self-worth, be it getting his family back, his job back, or score a one-night stand, then he would be fine for the day. And if only he could stop chasing these things, embark on an inner journey and find where the problem lies. Or simply snort crack and imbibe to cope.

    As a week-in-the-life-of a 31-year-old man named Tommy (Steve Buscemi), an out-of-work auto mechanic, this film plods along drearily and monotonously. Tommy's life is a mess. He hangs out at a local Long Island bar, called the Trees Lounge, where he hobnobs with other neighborhood deadbeats. None of the characters here have anything going for them. They drink alcohol, smoke, and talk. They're frustrated, unhappy, angry, and in a lot of emotional pain. Some viewers would call them losers. They don't know how to adapt to life's changes. They can't see beyond the dreary little world they've boxed themselves into. Their perspective is too confining. The best scenes take place inside the bar, where depressing jukebox songs play in the background. Outside the bar, scenes are largely uninteresting and perfunctory. But they do add depth to the characters, if the viewer has any interest in them to begin with. Some scenes play like a soap opera of life's defeated. Pace is slow. Dialogue is voluminous. Superficially, Buscemi, bug-eyed and anemic looking, is something of a trial to watch. Yet, he's no less attractive than other actors here. And that's a welcome change from blow-dried, photogenic fashion models, right out of central casting, who populate so many mainstream films. Low-budget, and very low-concept, "Trees Lounge" is just the ticket for the viewer who is depressed, bored, or feeling blue. One can empathize with Tommy, or his cohorts, knowing that the story is semi-autobiographical of Buscemi, before he got into acting.

    After looking forward to seeing this movie directed ,written by and starring one of my favourite actors Steve Buscemi and with a big name cast I was left disappointed . This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldn't relate to and the relationships between all characters weren't believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating . Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .

    This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular Joe." Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is "Lonesome Jim.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "Lonesome Jim.". So enjoy!

    This movie was interesting. It is about a semi-alcoholic (Buscemi)who throws away his life hanging out at a local bar in a small town outside of New York City. I liked the way he was portrayed of being liked and despised at the same time. The main character obviously came from a well established Italian-American family in the community. So, people know and associate with him, but at the same time are wary of him because he appears to be a "loser". The main character was once a very good mechanic, but lost his job when he stole money from the garage's till. The owner (Lapaglia) is torn. He is guilt-ridden, because not only did he steal the main character's girlfriend, but also is sorry to see his former friend throwing away his life drinking at the local bar. I also like all the supporting cast. There is a great deal of sorrow displayed in this old man, who is obviously beyond hope. When the old man is finally dying, all the locals who pretended to like him at the bar really are discovered to have not cared at all. The things that detracted from the movie was that the main character was immature and irresponsible. It was hard to empathize with a guy who does drugs and sleeps with a seventeen year old girl. In addition, there was a lot of lack of clarity in the film. Who was the main character in relation to the ice cream man who suddenly died. He is obviously treated like a family member, but no explanation is given as to whom he actually is. If someone just said that is "the nephew", it would have resolved a lot of confusion. So, the movie was interesting, but suffered from a lack of empathy for the plight of the main character, and confusion about whom exactly he is. I would have liked to seen more shown to illustrate what led him to where he ended up as.

    This is real life stuff at its best. Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge. It was like I had my own barstool just watching what was going on. The character development is superb. Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi. You can almost feel that he is not really acting in this role...it feels more like he is re-living part of his life experience in the movie. It is a slice of life from the outskirts of NYC or Nothern NJ that seems like it would actually happen.

This is a perfect example that illustrates good actors don't necessarily make good films! The characters are weak, the story told a thousand times before and the complete luck of active plot makes the film suitable only for TV on a Sunday afternoon. Buscemi fails to push the actors to their limits resulting in a 'soap opera' style performance which is well below the average. Most of the scenes were pointless and contributed nothing to the film. Trees Lounge could have started straight after Tommy inherited the Van (thirty minutes before the end) and still wouldn't make any difference! If you do end up watching the film just imagine how the film would be like if Tarantino directed it. Better watch TV commercials :(

    From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Tree's Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Tree's Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.

    Loved it.... While not especially dark, this film really captures the lingering malaise that is a working life in the New York area burbs. If you spent any time growing up, living in the area you know a place like the "Trees Lounge" that is populated by "townies" that sort of never leave. I won't write a review of the performances/script other than it is a great "capture." Highly recommended -- especially for those that love theater as well. Stellar all around - glad I caught it on Netflix. You may very well want to watch this flick as a warning tale as well. You already know everyone in the film!

    This is a tale of a jobless deceitful Tommy Basilio who never took anything seriously in his life, including himself. Therefore he lost his love and present, lost having a dream or a tomorrow. At one moment he says "Everybody is lost. But nobody says that about himself !" That guy lives above a bar, (and in it !). After 8 years of affair, his girl goes to his boss; who deserves her more, since he achieves himself, and planed his tomorrow. Now we follow the features of that 40 year old teen's aberration; a caprice with a teen girl that equals his adolescence, being too cowered to admit that he's a loser, his torn connections with everybody, his incapacity to have any kind of balanced human relationship.. So that's why he begged a touch of hand from the girl who danced with him (who drunkenly slept before requesting any physical love from her side). The movie managed to embody the statues of some people from that loser town as well; the dancing woman is unhappily married, the company's owner  who goes constantly to the bar  is irresponsible towards his wife and kids,.. etc. As you see, everybody is a drunken adolescent who has no hope for getting out of their stalemate or that town, along with those rotten invariable values; such as negativism, laziness and separation, that they imprisoned themselves in. The funniest thing is the lead's transforming at the end to a twin for the old drunken man who used to sit in the bar for all the time like a corpse. It insinuated that he'll meet the same fate; turning into a lonely aged, no talker no listener, frozen sot who "Will wake up someday, not breathing !" There are some clever scenes. 2 of them are unforgettable. The first is when the lead's ex-lover was re-watching his old home video. Look how the movie's camera goes beyond the TV's screen, to live the good memories. Maybe because the frivolous past of a character like Tommy is his present and future. Or maybe because these memories have some hot feelings that still alive inside that tape, and that lover who deplores Tommy as lost or determined on being lost. The second scene is when the lead sees his ex-love after giving birth to a baby. He understood there that he can't push the time back to win what he resolved to lose. And that the baby isn't his son; whether due to how he can't give life, even for himself !, or due to the fact that that baby would never have a life under his dead tree. This is surely the best climax for this movie. So when you read the tagline : "a story about one man's search... for who knows what.", you'll easily understand that his search is for an escape, away from his irresponsible self, or admitting it. I knew (Steve Buscemi) first as an extra in (Pulp Fiction), then as an always scary psychopath killer in movies like (Con Air) and (Some Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead). To an extent that in 1999, when Empire magazine published a reportage about the best 100 movies in history, the icon that they used to define the degree of bloodiness in every movie was a face so similar to his! So imagine my surprise to witness how he can act, write, and direct something distinct, serene, and not bloody such as this. I just hated the poster's line "Black Comedy". Clearly the term "Drama" is unprofitable or unpopular in America of the last decades ! There was no need for such a lie or for hiring big name like (Samuel L. Jackson) to do a useless cameo either. But these were some ways to market the movie in a market that mostly doesn't welcome anything except the holy : action and comedy flicks ! As a direction it's astonishingly simple and sensitively done. (Buscemi) did it without one second of allegation or exhausting technique. And as a script; it's subtle, bitter and enjoyable study for the anti-hero. In other words, sometimes a short novel bewitches me. Here's one of them.

    The depiction of the life of a man descending to lower levels is something you seldom see in movies. This movie is very realistic in its approach to the subject. Once a semi-respected man with a job, girlfriend and future, he now has to cope with the downfall and losing his community's respect for him. Steve Buscemi is the perfect actor to play the role -his portrayal is very believable. The movie has some comic moments to make its dark subject tolerable. If only this tormented guy could obtain something to raise his self-worth, be it getting his family back, his job back, or score a one-night stand, then he would be fine for the day. And if only he could stop chasing these things, embark on an inner journey and find where the problem lies. Or simply snort crack and imbibe to cope.

    As a week-in-the-life-of a 31-year-old man named Tommy (Steve Buscemi), an out-of-work auto mechanic, this film plods along drearily and monotonously. Tommy's life is a mess. He hangs out at a local Long Island bar, called the Trees Lounge, where he hobnobs with other neighborhood deadbeats. None of the characters here have anything going for them. They drink alcohol, smoke, and talk. They're frustrated, unhappy, angry, and in a lot of emotional pain. Some viewers would call them losers. They don't know how to adapt to life's changes. They can't see beyond the dreary little world they've boxed themselves into. Their perspective is too confining. The best scenes take place inside the bar, where depressing jukebox songs play in the background. Outside the bar, scenes are largely uninteresting and perfunctory. But they do add depth to the characters, if the viewer has any interest in them to begin with. Some scenes play like a soap opera of life's defeated. Pace is slow. Dialogue is voluminous. Superficially, Buscemi, bug-eyed and anemic looking, is something of a trial to watch. Yet, he's no less attractive than other actors here. And that's a welcome change from blow-dried, photogenic fashion models, right out of central casting, who populate so many mainstream films. Low-budget, and very low-concept, "Trees Lounge" is just the ticket for the viewer who is depressed, bored, or feeling blue. One can empathize with Tommy, or his cohorts, knowing that the story is semi-autobiographical of Buscemi, before he got into acting.

    After looking forward to seeing this movie directed ,written by and starring one of my favourite actors Steve Buscemi and with a big name cast I was left disappointed . This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldn't relate to and the relationships between all characters weren't believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating . Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .

    This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular Joe." Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is "Lonesome Jim.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "Lonesome Jim.". So enjoy!

    This movie was interesting. It is about a semi-alcoholic (Buscemi)who throws away his life hanging out at a local bar in a small town outside of New York City. I liked the way he was portrayed of being liked and despised at the same time. The main character obviously came from a well established Italian-American family in the community. So, people know and associate with him, but at the same time are wary of him because he appears to be a "loser". The main character was once a very good mechanic, but lost his job when he stole money from the garage's till. The owner (Lapaglia) is torn. He is guilt-ridden, because not only did he steal the main character's girlfriend, but also is sorry to see his former friend throwing away his life drinking at the local bar. I also like all the supporting cast. There is a great deal of sorrow displayed in this old man, who is obviously beyond hope. When the old man is finally dying, all the locals who pretended to like him at the bar really are discovered to have not cared at all. The things that detracted from the movie was that the main character was immature and irresponsible. It was hard to empathize with a guy who does drugs and sleeps with a seventeen year old girl. In addition, there was a lot of lack of clarity in the film. Who was the main character in relation to the ice cream man who suddenly died. He is obviously treated like a family member, but no explanation is given as to whom he actually is. If someone just said that is "the nephew", it would have resolved a lot of confusion. So, the movie was interesting, but suffered from a lack of empathy for the plight of the main character, and confusion about whom exactly he is. I would have liked to seen more shown to illustrate what led him to where he ended up as.

    This is real life stuff at its best. Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge. It was like I had my own barstool just watching what was going on. The character development is superb. Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi. You can almost feel that he is not really acting in this role...it feels more like he is re-living part of his life experience in the movie. It is a slice of life from the outskirts of NYC or Nothern NJ that seems like it would actually happen.

This is a perfect example that illustrates good actors don't necessarily make good films! The characters are weak, the story told a thousand times before and the complete luck of active plot makes the film suitable only for TV on a Sunday afternoon. Buscemi fails to push the actors to their limits resulting in a 'soap opera' style performance which is well below the average. Most of the scenes were pointless and contributed nothing to the film. Trees Lounge could have started straight after Tommy inherited the Van (thirty minutes before the end) and still wouldn't make any difference! If you do end up watching the film just imagine how the film would be like if Tarantino directed it. Better watch TV commercials :(

    From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Tree's Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Tree's Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.

    Loved it.... While not especially dark, this film really captures the lingering malaise that is a working life in the New York area burbs. If you spent any time growing up, living in the area you know a place like the "Trees Lounge" that is populated by "townies" that sort of never leave. I won't write a review of the performances/script other than it is a great "capture." Highly recommended -- especially for those that love theater as well. Stellar all around - glad I caught it on Netflix. You may very well want to watch this flick as a warning tale as well. You already know everyone in the film!

    This is a tale of a jobless deceitful Tommy Basilio who never took anything seriously in his life, including himself. Therefore he lost his love and present, lost having a dream or a tomorrow. At one moment he says "Everybody is lost. But nobody says that about himself !" That guy lives above a bar, (and in it !). After 8 years of affair, his girl goes to his boss; who deserves her more, since he achieves himself, and planed his tomorrow. Now we follow the features of that 40 year old teen's aberration; a caprice with a teen girl that equals his adolescence, being too cowered to admit that he's a loser, his torn connections with everybody, his incapacity to have any kind of balanced human relationship.. So that's why he begged a touch of hand from the girl who danced with him (who drunkenly slept before requesting any physical love from her side). The movie managed to embody the statues of some people from that loser town as well; the dancing woman is unhappily married, the company's owner  who goes constantly to the bar  is irresponsible towards his wife and kids,.. etc. As you see, everybody is a drunken adolescent who has no hope for getting out of their stalemate or that town, along with those rotten invariable values; such as negativism, laziness and separation, that they imprisoned themselves in. The funniest thing is the lead's transforming at the end to a twin for the old drunken man who used to sit in the bar for all the time like a corpse. It insinuated that he'll meet the same fate; turning into a lonely aged, no talker no listener, frozen sot who "Will wake up someday, not breathing !" There are some clever scenes. 2 of them are unforgettable. The first is when the lead's ex-lover was re-watching his old home video. Look how the movie's camera goes beyond the TV's screen, to live the good memories. Maybe because the frivolous past of a character like Tommy is his present and future. Or maybe because these memories have some hot feelings that still alive inside that tape, and that lover who deplores Tommy as lost or determined on being lost. The second scene is when the lead sees his ex-love after giving birth to a baby. He understood there that he can't push the time back to win what he resolved to lose. And that the baby isn't his son; whether due to how he can't give life, even for himself !, or due to the fact that that baby would never have a life under his dead tree. This is surely the best climax for this movie. So when you read the tagline : "a story about one man's search... for who knows what.", you'll easily understand that his search is for an escape, away from his irresponsible self, or admitting it. I knew (Steve Buscemi) first as an extra in (Pulp Fiction), then as an always scary psychopath killer in movies like (Con Air) and (Some Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead). To an extent that in 1999, when Empire magazine published a reportage about the best 100 movies in history, the icon that they used to define the degree of bloodiness in every movie was a face so similar to his! So imagine my surprise to witness how he can act, write, and direct something distinct, serene, and not bloody such as this. I just hated the poster's line "Black Comedy". Clearly the term "Drama" is unprofitable or unpopular in America of the last decades ! There was no need for such a lie or for hiring big name like (Samuel L. Jackson) to do a useless cameo either. But these were some ways to market the movie in a market that mostly doesn't welcome anything except the holy : action and comedy flicks ! As a direction it's astonishingly simple and sensitively done. (Buscemi) did it without one second of allegation or exhausting technique. And as a script; it's subtle, bitter and enjoyable study for the anti-hero. In other words, sometimes a short novel bewitches me. Here's one of them.

    The depiction of the life of a man descending to lower levels is something you seldom see in movies. This movie is very realistic in its approach to the subject. Once a semi-respected man with a job, girlfriend and future, he now has to cope with the downfall and losing his community's respect for him. Steve Buscemi is the perfect actor to play the role -his portrayal is very believable. The movie has some comic moments to make its dark subject tolerable. If only this tormented guy could obtain something to raise his self-worth, be it getting his family back, his job back, or score a one-night stand, then he would be fine for the day. And if only he could stop chasing these things, embark on an inner journey and find where the problem lies. Or simply snort crack and imbibe to cope.

    As a week-in-the-life-of a 31-year-old man named Tommy (Steve Buscemi), an out-of-work auto mechanic, this film plods along drearily and monotonously. Tommy's life is a mess. He hangs out at a local Long Island bar, called the Trees Lounge, where he hobnobs with other neighborhood deadbeats. None of the characters here have anything going for them. They drink alcohol, smoke, and talk. They're frustrated, unhappy, angry, and in a lot of emotional pain. Some viewers would call them losers. They don't know how to adapt to life's changes. They can't see beyond the dreary little world they've boxed themselves into. Their perspective is too confining. The best scenes take place inside the bar, where depressing jukebox songs play in the background. Outside the bar, scenes are largely uninteresting and perfunctory. But they do add depth to the characters, if the viewer has any interest in them to begin with. Some scenes play like a soap opera of life's defeated. Pace is slow. Dialogue is voluminous. Superficially, Buscemi, bug-eyed and anemic looking, is something of a trial to watch. Yet, he's no less attractive than other actors here. And that's a welcome change from blow-dried, photogenic fashion models, right out of central casting, who populate so many mainstream films. Low-budget, and very low-concept, "Trees Lounge" is just the ticket for the viewer who is depressed, bored, or feeling blue. One can empathize with Tommy, or his cohorts, knowing that the story is semi-autobiographical of Buscemi, before he got into acting.

    After looking forward to seeing this movie directed ,written by and starring one of my favourite actors Steve Buscemi and with a big name cast I was left disappointed . This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldn't relate to and the relationships between all characters weren't believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating . Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .

    This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular Joe." Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is "Lonesome Jim.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "Lonesome Jim.". So enjoy!

    This movie was interesting. It is about a semi-alcoholic (Buscemi)who throws away his life hanging out at a local bar in a small town outside of New York City. I liked the way he was portrayed of being liked and despised at the same time. The main character obviously came from a well established Italian-American family in the community. So, people know and associate with him, but at the same time are wary of him because he appears to be a "loser". The main character was once a very good mechanic, but lost his job when he stole money from the garage's till. The owner (Lapaglia) is torn. He is guilt-ridden, because not only did he steal the main character's girlfriend, but also is sorry to see his former friend throwing away his life drinking at the local bar. I also like all the supporting cast. There is a great deal of sorrow displayed in this old man, who is obviously beyond hope. When the old man is finally dying, all the locals who pretended to like him at the bar really are discovered to have not cared at all. The things that detracted from the movie was that the main character was immature and irresponsible. It was hard to empathize with a guy who does drugs and sleeps with a seventeen year old girl. In addition, there was a lot of lack of clarity in the film. Who was the main character in relation to the ice cream man who suddenly died. He is obviously treated like a family member, but no explanation is given as to whom he actually is. If someone just said that is "the nephew", it would have resolved a lot of confusion. So, the movie was interesting, but suffered from a lack of empathy for the plight of the main character, and confusion about whom exactly he is. I would have liked to seen more shown to illustrate what led him to where he ended up as.

    This is real life stuff at its best. Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge. It was like I had my own barstool just watching what was going on. The character development is superb. Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi. You can almost feel that he is not really acting in this role...it feels more like he is re-living part of his life experience in the movie. It is a slice of life from the outskirts of NYC or Nothern NJ that seems like it would actually happen.
