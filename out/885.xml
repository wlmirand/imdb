    The first half hour or so, when two young women find themselves in the completely uninhabited town of Snowfall, Colorado, is kind of interesting. Shots of communities that are empty of people can be fascinating. They stimulate fantasies of what WE might do if we were set loose in a place where, no matter what indiscretions we commit, they would hurt no one, and there is no authority to answer to. And that's about it. The remainder of this horror movie does to the mind what the Trinity Test did to Yucca Flats. Your brain turns to fragile flakes of glass. Rose McGowan does alright by the role of the threatened girl. Peter O'Toole is firm and authoritarian, though I appreciated him more in those films in which he was nuts -- "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Night of the Generals." He's even good when he's relatively normal and has the right material, as in "Stuntman." Here, he's stuck in the hapless role of the foreign expert brought in to solve an impenetrable mystery. It resembles "Alien" in that men get sucked up into barely-glimpsed globs of crap, accompanied by the sound of a paddle stirring a pot of molasses. But it's not nearly as good as "Alien." It has succumbed to the fads for instant editing during action scenes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Don't do it.

    A compendium of horror clich&eacute;s adapted by typing machine Dean Koontz from his own book. It starts promisingly with a deserted town and a mysterious force, but any interest is soon buried beneath an increasingly tedious avalanche of unsubtle dialogue, listless performances, non-characters, shooting and familiar visual effects. This is a mechanical and lazily written film in which the characters take credibility-defying leaps in figuring out what's going on, with the inevitable inclusion of the over-informed expert to plug the gaps (in this case it's Peter O'Toole, whose performance is rotten). What little character development exists is there only to set up a couple of cheap scares and so many surprises fail to surprise that the movie quickly becomes tiresome. Worst of all is the inattentive direction of the performances: there's a lack of reaction to what should be horrifying and bizarre events; no one seems too amazed even when a man spews up a lizard onto a piece of broken glass he pulls out of his mouth before collapsing into a puddle of black goo. Rubbish.

    Reading the description of this film on net-Flix made out to be better then it actually was. The film has enormous potential, imagine all the things you could have done with a ghost town. But no, it turns into some science fiction BS that really lets you down. Throughout the whole film, I was constantly making my own version of what could have happened. It really fails at bringing any horror, and doesn't offer enough suspense. I would gladly take the concept of a town where the residents disappeared, and make it into a better film. I'm not saying it's bad, it just didn't work. Don't even get me started on the Stu monster making jokes. Ben Affleck was good, the two sisters were just fine. Liev Schreiber was creepy as all hell. Overall, I didn't really care for it. Give it a watch if you are interested.

    Drop-dead gorgeous doctor Joanna Going (as Jennifer "Jenny" Pailey) wants little sister Rose McGowan (as Lisa Pailey) to ease up on the Los Angeles fast lane. So Ms. Going takes Ms. McGowan to relax in the sleepy resort town of Snowfield, Colorado. The two women discover the town is so sleepy, it's dead. In fact, they are immediately greeted by creepy lifeless bodies. There are some live ones, too - like handsome sheriff Ben Affleck (as Bryce Hammond) and his deputies - gum chewing Liev Schreiber (as Stuart "Stu" Wargle) and heavily mustached Nicky Katt (as Steve Shanning)... Top-billed Peter O'Toole (as Timothy Flyte) is a tabloid reporter who may be able to solve the mystery. Appearing later, Mr. O'Toole's character writes articles about "Bigfoot" and "Elvis" sightings. More important is his series about an "Ancient Enemy" responsible for killing the Mayans, among others... "Phantoms" starts out well and goes downhill. Direction and editing go for a style which does not build much suspense. There are many slow pans, leading to and from close-ups. The special effects are mostly there for the cameras to document, without building tension. There is no intrigue about what is happening. However, you can see how the mysteries may have unraveled skillfully in the original novel, by Dean Koontz. It's likely many involved in this production wished their efforts looked better. Whatever "It" is shows good taste in music by liking Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces". **** Phantoms (1/23/98) Joe Chappelle ~ Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan

    If you have never read a Dean Koontz Horror Novel this Movie will likely not inspire such wantings. Scripted by the Book's Author this adaptation of his own work is full of it. Full of clich&eacute;s, uninspired Acting, mediocre SFX, unfunny funny lines and references (Patsy Cline's I Fall to Pieces is heard while you see, you guessed it), well that's enough, but there's more. The Cast seems to be standing around a lot with blank stares waiting for someone, anyone, to say Action, or something. Speaking of Action, early on there is a Scene that telegraphs just how lame and misdirected this is. A "Thing" shows up and we have our three Leads, standing shoulder to shoulder pumping hundreds of bullets at a window. It looks like something out of completely different Movie, or Genre for that matter. So the warning comes early, and it is right on. Nothing that happens after-wards is remotely scary, interesting, or worth your time. This is not the worst Horror/Sci-Fi Movie ever made but it tries really hard to be a contender.

    Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) brings her younger sister Lisa (McGowan) to her small Colorado town in an attempt to keep her out of trouble. When they arrive they find everyone in town dead minus a few others including Sheriff Bryce (Affleck) and a handful of others. Fearing an outbreak of some kind, the small band of people tries to find logic and a common thread. One victim has scrawled the name Timothy Flyte in blood on the wall. Flyte (O'Toole), is a tabloid writer who wrote a story about an ancient evil that comes up from the depths of the earth every 100 years or so, and devours anything in it's way. Flyte, and the Army is called in and the entity takes on the form of the people's fear. Lisa calls it the Devil and now it thinks it is and it seems intent on killing everyone. Dean Koontz adapts his own novel into this screenplay and Director Joe Chappelle makes the first 20 minutes incredibly tight with jump scares and thick atmosphere. The girls walking around a dead town in fright is simply chilling. Horror fans will enjoy many elements at work here including some cool monster designs, gore and even suspense. The cast is solid with Peter O'Toole giving the picture a sense of class. Elements of the story could have made this very cheesy but Chappelle manages to steer the film away from that. The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.

    I read the novel and also watched the movie (although one could question why I would see the movie after reading the novel.) By the way this review contains no spoilers although it's hard to spoil a story as predictable a this one. My minivan broke down in the middle of nowhere (Salina, Utah - a town of 2,393 persons) while I was trying to move to California from Florida. The hotel I stayed at had a lending library and the woman at the desk recommended this book while I waited the two days for my vehicle's repairs. Now I must say that this isn't the first Koontz book I've read but it was the worst. And the movie didn't make things any better. The same predictable plots and plot devices. You still know who the love interest is right at the beginning (which works for a rom-com plot but not a thriller, usually). You know who's going to die right away. You can even predict how they will die. Everything about this movie is clich&eacute; squared. I cannot recommend to anyone who likes suspense. There is no suspense to be had here... move along.

    Most thriller/horror movies have plots that are completely ridiculous when a bit of thought is applied to them. This one surprised me in the scientific integrity. Not only was the antagonist believable even after it was explained, not all the characters came off as total morons! The doctors actually acted like and spoke as if they had more than a high school education. Even the corpses looked pretty realistic! The set was nothing special. The cinematography and sound were both mediocre at best. The acting was pretty good. But if you're a science fiction fan and sick of silly plots, give this movie a chance. You may just enjoy it.

    I had no preconceptions about this movie since I happened across it just starting whilst channel flicking. The synopsis of the empty town appealed and then I saw it was based on a Koontz book, so I stuck with it. If I had rated this movie on the first 10 minutes it would be a 2 or 3. The acting is simply atrocious, especially by McGowen. What should have been the creepiest part, wandering around a deserted town, turned into a cringe-fest of terrible acting and clich&eacute;d lines and camera positioning, and some awful cheap looking effects. However, once the monster starts showing itself I was pleasantly surprised that the effects improved considerably. They were similar to "The Thing" in many respects (although not to the same level), and showed at least some originality over the usual monsters. They managed to distract me fromthe stilted acting. The fact remains that, despite decent effects, the whole film is so clich&eacute; ridden that my wife and I were reduced to predicting each scene as it played out. It really was that bad. I couldn't tell it was trying to be a B movie or not. All in all extremely average, but it did at least pick up from the start and was an entertaining enough diversion with nothing else on the TV.

Rose McGowan does alright by the role of the threatened girl. Peter O'Toole is firm and authoritarian, though I appreciated him more in those films in which he was nuts -- "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Night of the Generals." He's even good when he's relatively normal and has the right material, as in "Stuntman." Here, he's stuck in the hapless role of the foreign expert brought in to solve an impenetrable mystery. It resembles "Alien" in that men get sucked up into barely-glimpsed globs of crap, accompanied by the sound of a paddle stirring a pot of molasses. But it's not nearly as good as "Alien." It has succumbed to the fads for instant editing during action scenes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Don't do it.

    A compendium of horror clich&eacute;s adapted by typing machine Dean Koontz from his own book. It starts promisingly with a deserted town and a mysterious force, but any interest is soon buried beneath an increasingly tedious avalanche of unsubtle dialogue, listless performances, non-characters, shooting and familiar visual effects. This is a mechanical and lazily written film in which the characters take credibility-defying leaps in figuring out what's going on, with the inevitable inclusion of the over-informed expert to plug the gaps (in this case it's Peter O'Toole, whose performance is rotten). What little character development exists is there only to set up a couple of cheap scares and so many surprises fail to surprise that the movie quickly becomes tiresome. Worst of all is the inattentive direction of the performances: there's a lack of reaction to what should be horrifying and bizarre events; no one seems too amazed even when a man spews up a lizard onto a piece of broken glass he pulls out of his mouth before collapsing into a puddle of black goo. Rubbish.

    Reading the description of this film on net-Flix made out to be better then it actually was. The film has enormous potential, imagine all the things you could have done with a ghost town. But no, it turns into some science fiction BS that really lets you down. Throughout the whole film, I was constantly making my own version of what could have happened. It really fails at bringing any horror, and doesn't offer enough suspense. I would gladly take the concept of a town where the residents disappeared, and make it into a better film. I'm not saying it's bad, it just didn't work. Don't even get me started on the Stu monster making jokes. Ben Affleck was good, the two sisters were just fine. Liev Schreiber was creepy as all hell. Overall, I didn't really care for it. Give it a watch if you are interested.

    Drop-dead gorgeous doctor Joanna Going (as Jennifer "Jenny" Pailey) wants little sister Rose McGowan (as Lisa Pailey) to ease up on the Los Angeles fast lane. So Ms. Going takes Ms. McGowan to relax in the sleepy resort town of Snowfield, Colorado. The two women discover the town is so sleepy, it's dead. In fact, they are immediately greeted by creepy lifeless bodies. There are some live ones, too - like handsome sheriff Ben Affleck (as Bryce Hammond) and his deputies - gum chewing Liev Schreiber (as Stuart "Stu" Wargle) and heavily mustached Nicky Katt (as Steve Shanning)... Top-billed Peter O'Toole (as Timothy Flyte) is a tabloid reporter who may be able to solve the mystery. Appearing later, Mr. O'Toole's character writes articles about "Bigfoot" and "Elvis" sightings. More important is his series about an "Ancient Enemy" responsible for killing the Mayans, among others... "Phantoms" starts out well and goes downhill. Direction and editing go for a style which does not build much suspense. There are many slow pans, leading to and from close-ups. The special effects are mostly there for the cameras to document, without building tension. There is no intrigue about what is happening. However, you can see how the mysteries may have unraveled skillfully in the original novel, by Dean Koontz. It's likely many involved in this production wished their efforts looked better. Whatever "It" is shows good taste in music by liking Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces". **** Phantoms (1/23/98) Joe Chappelle ~ Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan

    If you have never read a Dean Koontz Horror Novel this Movie will likely not inspire such wantings. Scripted by the Book's Author this adaptation of his own work is full of it. Full of clich&eacute;s, uninspired Acting, mediocre SFX, unfunny funny lines and references (Patsy Cline's I Fall to Pieces is heard while you see, you guessed it), well that's enough, but there's more. The Cast seems to be standing around a lot with blank stares waiting for someone, anyone, to say Action, or something. Speaking of Action, early on there is a Scene that telegraphs just how lame and misdirected this is. A "Thing" shows up and we have our three Leads, standing shoulder to shoulder pumping hundreds of bullets at a window. It looks like something out of completely different Movie, or Genre for that matter. So the warning comes early, and it is right on. Nothing that happens after-wards is remotely scary, interesting, or worth your time. This is not the worst Horror/Sci-Fi Movie ever made but it tries really hard to be a contender.

    Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) brings her younger sister Lisa (McGowan) to her small Colorado town in an attempt to keep her out of trouble. When they arrive they find everyone in town dead minus a few others including Sheriff Bryce (Affleck) and a handful of others. Fearing an outbreak of some kind, the small band of people tries to find logic and a common thread. One victim has scrawled the name Timothy Flyte in blood on the wall. Flyte (O'Toole), is a tabloid writer who wrote a story about an ancient evil that comes up from the depths of the earth every 100 years or so, and devours anything in it's way. Flyte, and the Army is called in and the entity takes on the form of the people's fear. Lisa calls it the Devil and now it thinks it is and it seems intent on killing everyone. Dean Koontz adapts his own novel into this screenplay and Director Joe Chappelle makes the first 20 minutes incredibly tight with jump scares and thick atmosphere. The girls walking around a dead town in fright is simply chilling. Horror fans will enjoy many elements at work here including some cool monster designs, gore and even suspense. The cast is solid with Peter O'Toole giving the picture a sense of class. Elements of the story could have made this very cheesy but Chappelle manages to steer the film away from that. The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.

    I read the novel and also watched the movie (although one could question why I would see the movie after reading the novel.) By the way this review contains no spoilers although it's hard to spoil a story as predictable a this one. My minivan broke down in the middle of nowhere (Salina, Utah - a town of 2,393 persons) while I was trying to move to California from Florida. The hotel I stayed at had a lending library and the woman at the desk recommended this book while I waited the two days for my vehicle's repairs. Now I must say that this isn't the first Koontz book I've read but it was the worst. And the movie didn't make things any better. The same predictable plots and plot devices. You still know who the love interest is right at the beginning (which works for a rom-com plot but not a thriller, usually). You know who's going to die right away. You can even predict how they will die. Everything about this movie is clich&eacute; squared. I cannot recommend to anyone who likes suspense. There is no suspense to be had here... move along.

    Most thriller/horror movies have plots that are completely ridiculous when a bit of thought is applied to them. This one surprised me in the scientific integrity. Not only was the antagonist believable even after it was explained, not all the characters came off as total morons! The doctors actually acted like and spoke as if they had more than a high school education. Even the corpses looked pretty realistic! The set was nothing special. The cinematography and sound were both mediocre at best. The acting was pretty good. But if you're a science fiction fan and sick of silly plots, give this movie a chance. You may just enjoy it.

    I had no preconceptions about this movie since I happened across it just starting whilst channel flicking. The synopsis of the empty town appealed and then I saw it was based on a Koontz book, so I stuck with it. If I had rated this movie on the first 10 minutes it would be a 2 or 3. The acting is simply atrocious, especially by McGowen. What should have been the creepiest part, wandering around a deserted town, turned into a cringe-fest of terrible acting and clich&eacute;d lines and camera positioning, and some awful cheap looking effects. However, once the monster starts showing itself I was pleasantly surprised that the effects improved considerably. They were similar to "The Thing" in many respects (although not to the same level), and showed at least some originality over the usual monsters. They managed to distract me fromthe stilted acting. The fact remains that, despite decent effects, the whole film is so clich&eacute; ridden that my wife and I were reduced to predicting each scene as it played out. It really was that bad. I couldn't tell it was trying to be a B movie or not. All in all extremely average, but it did at least pick up from the start and was an entertaining enough diversion with nothing else on the TV.

    The first half hour or so, when two young women find themselves in the completely uninhabited town of Snowfall, Colorado, is kind of interesting. Shots of communities that are empty of people can be fascinating. They stimulate fantasies of what WE might do if we were set loose in a place where, no matter what indiscretions we commit, they would hurt no one, and there is no authority to answer to. And that's about it. The remainder of this horror movie does to the mind what the Trinity Test did to Yucca Flats. Your brain turns to fragile flakes of glass.

But no, it turns into some science fiction BS that really lets you down. Throughout the whole film, I was constantly making my own version of what could have happened. It really fails at bringing any horror, and doesn't offer enough suspense. I would gladly take the concept of a town where the residents disappeared, and make it into a better film. I'm not saying it's bad, it just didn't work. Don't even get me started on the Stu monster making jokes. Ben Affleck was good, the two sisters were just fine. Liev Schreiber was creepy as all hell. Overall, I didn't really care for it. Give it a watch if you are interested.

    Drop-dead gorgeous doctor Joanna Going (as Jennifer "Jenny" Pailey) wants little sister Rose McGowan (as Lisa Pailey) to ease up on the Los Angeles fast lane. So Ms. Going takes Ms. McGowan to relax in the sleepy resort town of Snowfield, Colorado. The two women discover the town is so sleepy, it's dead. In fact, they are immediately greeted by creepy lifeless bodies. There are some live ones, too - like handsome sheriff Ben Affleck (as Bryce Hammond) and his deputies - gum chewing Liev Schreiber (as Stuart "Stu" Wargle) and heavily mustached Nicky Katt (as Steve Shanning)... Top-billed Peter O'Toole (as Timothy Flyte) is a tabloid reporter who may be able to solve the mystery. Appearing later, Mr. O'Toole's character writes articles about "Bigfoot" and "Elvis" sightings. More important is his series about an "Ancient Enemy" responsible for killing the Mayans, among others... "Phantoms" starts out well and goes downhill. Direction and editing go for a style which does not build much suspense. There are many slow pans, leading to and from close-ups. The special effects are mostly there for the cameras to document, without building tension. There is no intrigue about what is happening. However, you can see how the mysteries may have unraveled skillfully in the original novel, by Dean Koontz. It's likely many involved in this production wished their efforts looked better. Whatever "It" is shows good taste in music by liking Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces". **** Phantoms (1/23/98) Joe Chappelle ~ Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan

    If you have never read a Dean Koontz Horror Novel this Movie will likely not inspire such wantings. Scripted by the Book's Author this adaptation of his own work is full of it. Full of clich&eacute;s, uninspired Acting, mediocre SFX, unfunny funny lines and references (Patsy Cline's I Fall to Pieces is heard while you see, you guessed it), well that's enough, but there's more. The Cast seems to be standing around a lot with blank stares waiting for someone, anyone, to say Action, or something. Speaking of Action, early on there is a Scene that telegraphs just how lame and misdirected this is. A "Thing" shows up and we have our three Leads, standing shoulder to shoulder pumping hundreds of bullets at a window. It looks like something out of completely different Movie, or Genre for that matter. So the warning comes early, and it is right on. Nothing that happens after-wards is remotely scary, interesting, or worth your time. This is not the worst Horror/Sci-Fi Movie ever made but it tries really hard to be a contender.

    Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) brings her younger sister Lisa (McGowan) to her small Colorado town in an attempt to keep her out of trouble. When they arrive they find everyone in town dead minus a few others including Sheriff Bryce (Affleck) and a handful of others. Fearing an outbreak of some kind, the small band of people tries to find logic and a common thread. One victim has scrawled the name Timothy Flyte in blood on the wall. Flyte (O'Toole), is a tabloid writer who wrote a story about an ancient evil that comes up from the depths of the earth every 100 years or so, and devours anything in it's way. Flyte, and the Army is called in and the entity takes on the form of the people's fear. Lisa calls it the Devil and now it thinks it is and it seems intent on killing everyone. Dean Koontz adapts his own novel into this screenplay and Director Joe Chappelle makes the first 20 minutes incredibly tight with jump scares and thick atmosphere. The girls walking around a dead town in fright is simply chilling. Horror fans will enjoy many elements at work here including some cool monster designs, gore and even suspense. The cast is solid with Peter O'Toole giving the picture a sense of class. Elements of the story could have made this very cheesy but Chappelle manages to steer the film away from that. The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.

    I read the novel and also watched the movie (although one could question why I would see the movie after reading the novel.) By the way this review contains no spoilers although it's hard to spoil a story as predictable a this one. My minivan broke down in the middle of nowhere (Salina, Utah - a town of 2,393 persons) while I was trying to move to California from Florida. The hotel I stayed at had a lending library and the woman at the desk recommended this book while I waited the two days for my vehicle's repairs. Now I must say that this isn't the first Koontz book I've read but it was the worst. And the movie didn't make things any better. The same predictable plots and plot devices. You still know who the love interest is right at the beginning (which works for a rom-com plot but not a thriller, usually). You know who's going to die right away. You can even predict how they will die. Everything about this movie is clich&eacute; squared. I cannot recommend to anyone who likes suspense. There is no suspense to be had here... move along.

    Most thriller/horror movies have plots that are completely ridiculous when a bit of thought is applied to them. This one surprised me in the scientific integrity. Not only was the antagonist believable even after it was explained, not all the characters came off as total morons! The doctors actually acted like and spoke as if they had more than a high school education. Even the corpses looked pretty realistic! The set was nothing special. The cinematography and sound were both mediocre at best. The acting was pretty good. But if you're a science fiction fan and sick of silly plots, give this movie a chance. You may just enjoy it.

    I had no preconceptions about this movie since I happened across it just starting whilst channel flicking. The synopsis of the empty town appealed and then I saw it was based on a Koontz book, so I stuck with it. If I had rated this movie on the first 10 minutes it would be a 2 or 3. The acting is simply atrocious, especially by McGowen. What should have been the creepiest part, wandering around a deserted town, turned into a cringe-fest of terrible acting and clich&eacute;d lines and camera positioning, and some awful cheap looking effects. However, once the monster starts showing itself I was pleasantly surprised that the effects improved considerably. They were similar to "The Thing" in many respects (although not to the same level), and showed at least some originality over the usual monsters. They managed to distract me fromthe stilted acting. The fact remains that, despite decent effects, the whole film is so clich&eacute; ridden that my wife and I were reduced to predicting each scene as it played out. It really was that bad. I couldn't tell it was trying to be a B movie or not. All in all extremely average, but it did at least pick up from the start and was an entertaining enough diversion with nothing else on the TV.

    The first half hour or so, when two young women find themselves in the completely uninhabited town of Snowfall, Colorado, is kind of interesting. Shots of communities that are empty of people can be fascinating. They stimulate fantasies of what WE might do if we were set loose in a place where, no matter what indiscretions we commit, they would hurt no one, and there is no authority to answer to. And that's about it. The remainder of this horror movie does to the mind what the Trinity Test did to Yucca Flats. Your brain turns to fragile flakes of glass. Rose McGowan does alright by the role of the threatened girl. Peter O'Toole is firm and authoritarian, though I appreciated him more in those films in which he was nuts -- "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Night of the Generals." He's even good when he's relatively normal and has the right material, as in "Stuntman." Here, he's stuck in the hapless role of the foreign expert brought in to solve an impenetrable mystery. It resembles "Alien" in that men get sucked up into barely-glimpsed globs of crap, accompanied by the sound of a paddle stirring a pot of molasses. But it's not nearly as good as "Alien." It has succumbed to the fads for instant editing during action scenes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Don't do it.

    A compendium of horror clich&eacute;s adapted by typing machine Dean Koontz from his own book. It starts promisingly with a deserted town and a mysterious force, but any interest is soon buried beneath an increasingly tedious avalanche of unsubtle dialogue, listless performances, non-characters, shooting and familiar visual effects. This is a mechanical and lazily written film in which the characters take credibility-defying leaps in figuring out what's going on, with the inevitable inclusion of the over-informed expert to plug the gaps (in this case it's Peter O'Toole, whose performance is rotten). What little character development exists is there only to set up a couple of cheap scares and so many surprises fail to surprise that the movie quickly becomes tiresome. Worst of all is the inattentive direction of the performances: there's a lack of reaction to what should be horrifying and bizarre events; no one seems too amazed even when a man spews up a lizard onto a piece of broken glass he pulls out of his mouth before collapsing into a puddle of black goo. Rubbish.

    If you have never read a Dean Koontz Horror Novel this Movie will likely not inspire such wantings. Scripted by the Book's Author this adaptation of his own work is full of it. Full of clich&eacute;s, uninspired Acting, mediocre SFX, unfunny funny lines and references (Patsy Cline's I Fall to Pieces is heard while you see, you guessed it), well that's enough, but there's more. The Cast seems to be standing around a lot with blank stares waiting for someone, anyone, to say Action, or something. Speaking of Action, early on there is a Scene that telegraphs just how lame and misdirected this is. A "Thing" shows up and we have our three Leads, standing shoulder to shoulder pumping hundreds of bullets at a window. It looks like something out of completely different Movie, or Genre for that matter. So the warning comes early, and it is right on. Nothing that happens after-wards is remotely scary, interesting, or worth your time. This is not the worst Horror/Sci-Fi Movie ever made but it tries really hard to be a contender.

    Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) brings her younger sister Lisa (McGowan) to her small Colorado town in an attempt to keep her out of trouble. When they arrive they find everyone in town dead minus a few others including Sheriff Bryce (Affleck) and a handful of others. Fearing an outbreak of some kind, the small band of people tries to find logic and a common thread. One victim has scrawled the name Timothy Flyte in blood on the wall. Flyte (O'Toole), is a tabloid writer who wrote a story about an ancient evil that comes up from the depths of the earth every 100 years or so, and devours anything in it's way. Flyte, and the Army is called in and the entity takes on the form of the people's fear. Lisa calls it the Devil and now it thinks it is and it seems intent on killing everyone. Dean Koontz adapts his own novel into this screenplay and Director Joe Chappelle makes the first 20 minutes incredibly tight with jump scares and thick atmosphere. The girls walking around a dead town in fright is simply chilling. Horror fans will enjoy many elements at work here including some cool monster designs, gore and even suspense. The cast is solid with Peter O'Toole giving the picture a sense of class. Elements of the story could have made this very cheesy but Chappelle manages to steer the film away from that. The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.

    I read the novel and also watched the movie (although one could question why I would see the movie after reading the novel.) By the way this review contains no spoilers although it's hard to spoil a story as predictable a this one. My minivan broke down in the middle of nowhere (Salina, Utah - a town of 2,393 persons) while I was trying to move to California from Florida. The hotel I stayed at had a lending library and the woman at the desk recommended this book while I waited the two days for my vehicle's repairs. Now I must say that this isn't the first Koontz book I've read but it was the worst. And the movie didn't make things any better. The same predictable plots and plot devices. You still know who the love interest is right at the beginning (which works for a rom-com plot but not a thriller, usually). You know who's going to die right away. You can even predict how they will die. Everything about this movie is clich&eacute; squared. I cannot recommend to anyone who likes suspense. There is no suspense to be had here... move along.

    Most thriller/horror movies have plots that are completely ridiculous when a bit of thought is applied to them. This one surprised me in the scientific integrity. Not only was the antagonist believable even after it was explained, not all the characters came off as total morons! The doctors actually acted like and spoke as if they had more than a high school education. Even the corpses looked pretty realistic! The set was nothing special. The cinematography and sound were both mediocre at best. The acting was pretty good. But if you're a science fiction fan and sick of silly plots, give this movie a chance. You may just enjoy it.

    I had no preconceptions about this movie since I happened across it just starting whilst channel flicking. The synopsis of the empty town appealed and then I saw it was based on a Koontz book, so I stuck with it. If I had rated this movie on the first 10 minutes it would be a 2 or 3. The acting is simply atrocious, especially by McGowen. What should have been the creepiest part, wandering around a deserted town, turned into a cringe-fest of terrible acting and clich&eacute;d lines and camera positioning, and some awful cheap looking effects. However, once the monster starts showing itself I was pleasantly surprised that the effects improved considerably. They were similar to "The Thing" in many respects (although not to the same level), and showed at least some originality over the usual monsters. They managed to distract me fromthe stilted acting. The fact remains that, despite decent effects, the whole film is so clich&eacute; ridden that my wife and I were reduced to predicting each scene as it played out. It really was that bad. I couldn't tell it was trying to be a B movie or not. All in all extremely average, but it did at least pick up from the start and was an entertaining enough diversion with nothing else on the TV.

    The first half hour or so, when two young women find themselves in the completely uninhabited town of Snowfall, Colorado, is kind of interesting. Shots of communities that are empty of people can be fascinating. They stimulate fantasies of what WE might do if we were set loose in a place where, no matter what indiscretions we commit, they would hurt no one, and there is no authority to answer to. And that's about it. The remainder of this horror movie does to the mind what the Trinity Test did to Yucca Flats. Your brain turns to fragile flakes of glass. Rose McGowan does alright by the role of the threatened girl. Peter O'Toole is firm and authoritarian, though I appreciated him more in those films in which he was nuts -- "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Night of the Generals." He's even good when he's relatively normal and has the right material, as in "Stuntman." Here, he's stuck in the hapless role of the foreign expert brought in to solve an impenetrable mystery. It resembles "Alien" in that men get sucked up into barely-glimpsed globs of crap, accompanied by the sound of a paddle stirring a pot of molasses. But it's not nearly as good as "Alien." It has succumbed to the fads for instant editing during action scenes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Don't do it.

    A compendium of horror clich&eacute;s adapted by typing machine Dean Koontz from his own book. It starts promisingly with a deserted town and a mysterious force, but any interest is soon buried beneath an increasingly tedious avalanche of unsubtle dialogue, listless performances, non-characters, shooting and familiar visual effects. This is a mechanical and lazily written film in which the characters take credibility-defying leaps in figuring out what's going on, with the inevitable inclusion of the over-informed expert to plug the gaps (in this case it's Peter O'Toole, whose performance is rotten). What little character development exists is there only to set up a couple of cheap scares and so many surprises fail to surprise that the movie quickly becomes tiresome. Worst of all is the inattentive direction of the performances: there's a lack of reaction to what should be horrifying and bizarre events; no one seems too amazed even when a man spews up a lizard onto a piece of broken glass he pulls out of his mouth before collapsing into a puddle of black goo. Rubbish.

    Reading the description of this film on net-Flix made out to be better then it actually was. The film has enormous potential, imagine all the things you could have done with a ghost town. But no, it turns into some science fiction BS that really lets you down. Throughout the whole film, I was constantly making my own version of what could have happened. It really fails at bringing any horror, and doesn't offer enough suspense. I would gladly take the concept of a town where the residents disappeared, and make it into a better film. I'm not saying it's bad, it just didn't work. Don't even get me started on the Stu monster making jokes. Ben Affleck was good, the two sisters were just fine. Liev Schreiber was creepy as all hell. Overall, I didn't really care for it. Give it a watch if you are interested.

    Drop-dead gorgeous doctor Joanna Going (as Jennifer "Jenny" Pailey) wants little sister Rose McGowan (as Lisa Pailey) to ease up on the Los Angeles fast lane. So Ms. Going takes Ms. McGowan to relax in the sleepy resort town of Snowfield, Colorado. The two women discover the town is so sleepy, it's dead. In fact, they are immediately greeted by creepy lifeless bodies. There are some live ones, too - like handsome sheriff Ben Affleck (as Bryce Hammond) and his deputies - gum chewing Liev Schreiber (as Stuart "Stu" Wargle) and heavily mustached Nicky Katt (as Steve Shanning)... Top-billed Peter O'Toole (as Timothy Flyte) is a tabloid reporter who may be able to solve the mystery. Appearing later, Mr. O'Toole's character writes articles about "Bigfoot" and "Elvis" sightings. More important is his series about an "Ancient Enemy" responsible for killing the Mayans, among others... "Phantoms" starts out well and goes downhill. Direction and editing go for a style which does not build much suspense. There are many slow pans, leading to and from close-ups. The special effects are mostly there for the cameras to document, without building tension. There is no intrigue about what is happening. However, you can see how the mysteries may have unraveled skillfully in the original novel, by Dean Koontz. It's likely many involved in this production wished their efforts looked better. Whatever "It" is shows good taste in music by liking Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces". **** Phantoms (1/23/98) Joe Chappelle ~ Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan

The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.

    I read the novel and also watched the movie (although one could question why I would see the movie after reading the novel.) By the way this review contains no spoilers although it's hard to spoil a story as predictable a this one. My minivan broke down in the middle of nowhere (Salina, Utah - a town of 2,393 persons) while I was trying to move to California from Florida. The hotel I stayed at had a lending library and the woman at the desk recommended this book while I waited the two days for my vehicle's repairs. Now I must say that this isn't the first Koontz book I've read but it was the worst. And the movie didn't make things any better. The same predictable plots and plot devices. You still know who the love interest is right at the beginning (which works for a rom-com plot but not a thriller, usually). You know who's going to die right away. You can even predict how they will die. Everything about this movie is clich&eacute; squared. I cannot recommend to anyone who likes suspense. There is no suspense to be had here... move along.

    Most thriller/horror movies have plots that are completely ridiculous when a bit of thought is applied to them. This one surprised me in the scientific integrity. Not only was the antagonist believable even after it was explained, not all the characters came off as total morons! The doctors actually acted like and spoke as if they had more than a high school education. Even the corpses looked pretty realistic! The set was nothing special. The cinematography and sound were both mediocre at best. The acting was pretty good. But if you're a science fiction fan and sick of silly plots, give this movie a chance. You may just enjoy it.

    I had no preconceptions about this movie since I happened across it just starting whilst channel flicking. The synopsis of the empty town appealed and then I saw it was based on a Koontz book, so I stuck with it. If I had rated this movie on the first 10 minutes it would be a 2 or 3. The acting is simply atrocious, especially by McGowen. What should have been the creepiest part, wandering around a deserted town, turned into a cringe-fest of terrible acting and clich&eacute;d lines and camera positioning, and some awful cheap looking effects. However, once the monster starts showing itself I was pleasantly surprised that the effects improved considerably. They were similar to "The Thing" in many respects (although not to the same level), and showed at least some originality over the usual monsters. They managed to distract me fromthe stilted acting. The fact remains that, despite decent effects, the whole film is so clich&eacute; ridden that my wife and I were reduced to predicting each scene as it played out. It really was that bad. I couldn't tell it was trying to be a B movie or not. All in all extremely average, but it did at least pick up from the start and was an entertaining enough diversion with nothing else on the TV.

    The first half hour or so, when two young women find themselves in the completely uninhabited town of Snowfall, Colorado, is kind of interesting. Shots of communities that are empty of people can be fascinating. They stimulate fantasies of what WE might do if we were set loose in a place where, no matter what indiscretions we commit, they would hurt no one, and there is no authority to answer to. And that's about it. The remainder of this horror movie does to the mind what the Trinity Test did to Yucca Flats. Your brain turns to fragile flakes of glass. Rose McGowan does alright by the role of the threatened girl. Peter O'Toole is firm and authoritarian, though I appreciated him more in those films in which he was nuts -- "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Night of the Generals." He's even good when he's relatively normal and has the right material, as in "Stuntman." Here, he's stuck in the hapless role of the foreign expert brought in to solve an impenetrable mystery. It resembles "Alien" in that men get sucked up into barely-glimpsed globs of crap, accompanied by the sound of a paddle stirring a pot of molasses. But it's not nearly as good as "Alien." It has succumbed to the fads for instant editing during action scenes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Don't do it.

    A compendium of horror clich&eacute;s adapted by typing machine Dean Koontz from his own book. It starts promisingly with a deserted town and a mysterious force, but any interest is soon buried beneath an increasingly tedious avalanche of unsubtle dialogue, listless performances, non-characters, shooting and familiar visual effects. This is a mechanical and lazily written film in which the characters take credibility-defying leaps in figuring out what's going on, with the inevitable inclusion of the over-informed expert to plug the gaps (in this case it's Peter O'Toole, whose performance is rotten). What little character development exists is there only to set up a couple of cheap scares and so many surprises fail to surprise that the movie quickly becomes tiresome. Worst of all is the inattentive direction of the performances: there's a lack of reaction to what should be horrifying and bizarre events; no one seems too amazed even when a man spews up a lizard onto a piece of broken glass he pulls out of his mouth before collapsing into a puddle of black goo. Rubbish.

    Reading the description of this film on net-Flix made out to be better then it actually was. The film has enormous potential, imagine all the things you could have done with a ghost town. But no, it turns into some science fiction BS that really lets you down. Throughout the whole film, I was constantly making my own version of what could have happened. It really fails at bringing any horror, and doesn't offer enough suspense. I would gladly take the concept of a town where the residents disappeared, and make it into a better film. I'm not saying it's bad, it just didn't work. Don't even get me started on the Stu monster making jokes. Ben Affleck was good, the two sisters were just fine. Liev Schreiber was creepy as all hell. Overall, I didn't really care for it. Give it a watch if you are interested.

    Drop-dead gorgeous doctor Joanna Going (as Jennifer "Jenny" Pailey) wants little sister Rose McGowan (as Lisa Pailey) to ease up on the Los Angeles fast lane. So Ms. Going takes Ms. McGowan to relax in the sleepy resort town of Snowfield, Colorado. The two women discover the town is so sleepy, it's dead. In fact, they are immediately greeted by creepy lifeless bodies. There are some live ones, too - like handsome sheriff Ben Affleck (as Bryce Hammond) and his deputies - gum chewing Liev Schreiber (as Stuart "Stu" Wargle) and heavily mustached Nicky Katt (as Steve Shanning)... Top-billed Peter O'Toole (as Timothy Flyte) is a tabloid reporter who may be able to solve the mystery. Appearing later, Mr. O'Toole's character writes articles about "Bigfoot" and "Elvis" sightings. More important is his series about an "Ancient Enemy" responsible for killing the Mayans, among others... "Phantoms" starts out well and goes downhill. Direction and editing go for a style which does not build much suspense. There are many slow pans, leading to and from close-ups. The special effects are mostly there for the cameras to document, without building tension. There is no intrigue about what is happening. However, you can see how the mysteries may have unraveled skillfully in the original novel, by Dean Koontz. It's likely many involved in this production wished their efforts looked better. Whatever "It" is shows good taste in music by liking Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces". **** Phantoms (1/23/98) Joe Chappelle ~ Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan

    If you have never read a Dean Koontz Horror Novel this Movie will likely not inspire such wantings. Scripted by the Book's Author this adaptation of his own work is full of it. Full of clich&eacute;s, uninspired Acting, mediocre SFX, unfunny funny lines and references (Patsy Cline's I Fall to Pieces is heard while you see, you guessed it), well that's enough, but there's more. The Cast seems to be standing around a lot with blank stares waiting for someone, anyone, to say Action, or something. Speaking of Action, early on there is a Scene that telegraphs just how lame and misdirected this is. A "Thing" shows up and we have our three Leads, standing shoulder to shoulder pumping hundreds of bullets at a window. It looks like something out of completely different Movie, or Genre for that matter. So the warning comes early, and it is right on. Nothing that happens after-wards is remotely scary, interesting, or worth your time. This is not the worst Horror/Sci-Fi Movie ever made but it tries really hard to be a contender.

    Dr. Jennifer Pailey (Going) brings her younger sister Lisa (McGowan) to her small Colorado town in an attempt to keep her out of trouble. When they arrive they find everyone in town dead minus a few others including Sheriff Bryce (Affleck) and a handful of others. Fearing an outbreak of some kind, the small band of people tries to find logic and a common thread. One victim has scrawled the name Timothy Flyte in blood on the wall. Flyte (O'Toole), is a tabloid writer who wrote a story about an ancient evil that comes up from the depths of the earth every 100 years or so, and devours anything in it's way. Flyte, and the Army is called in and the entity takes on the form of the people's fear. Lisa calls it the Devil and now it thinks it is and it seems intent on killing everyone. Dean Koontz adapts his own novel into this screenplay and Director Joe Chappelle makes the first 20 minutes incredibly tight with jump scares and thick atmosphere. The girls walking around a dead town in fright is simply chilling. Horror fans will enjoy many elements at work here including some cool monster designs, gore and even suspense. The cast is solid with Peter O'Toole giving the picture a sense of class. Elements of the story could have made this very cheesy but Chappelle manages to steer the film away from that. The middle drags a little and there is an unnecessary and stupid final twist that threatens the films effectiveness. By far, the most chilling scene in the film is when Flyte is going to meet the being face to face. It is brilliantly executed and chilling as hell! This memorable moment almost deserves to be in a better film it is that good. 'Phantoms' is a fun and entertaining monster/creature film.
