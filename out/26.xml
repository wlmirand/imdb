 <sinopse>
  Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This angst-filled tale of three Irish-Catholic brothers explores men's relationships with women. Three different situations are set up on parallel plotlines, with each brother facing a different kind of crisis. Their common bond as family, as well as close lifelong friends, allows them to express their feelings frankly and intimately, as they talk and discuss their concerns among each other. Jack finds himself in a marriage gone stale and under pressure to start a family that he does not yet feel ready for. Barry, dedicated to his film career and almost pathologically averse to any type of commitment in a relationship, is suddenly artistically successful and finds true love, both for the first time and both pulling him in opposite directions. Patrick is torn between his love for his religion and ethnic heritage and his love for Susan, his longtime Jewish girlfriend. Ultimately, they are all asked to resist temptation of one sort or another, with various poignant outcomes.

    I have no idea why this movie was ever made. It's truly horrible. I mean what was the point? Lapsed Catholics are troubled people? None of the male characters is the least bit interesting or sympathetic. They are all total zeros. Given that the three brothers are absolute jerks, the contrived, blissful happy ending which is completely predictable is not in the least bit warranted in any of the three couples lives. The profanity is on a par with the number of beers consumed. I think I should have had a few before sitting down to this. The wife of the eldest brother who is married is about the only interesting character in the movie. She should apply for sainthood for sticking with a cheating husband. As far as I am concerned this is just more Catholic bashing from that Hollywood can not get enough of. Don't spend a minute watching this dreadful film.

    HAVING heard so much about this Film from our 2 Daughters (Jenn & Michelle Ryan), we never did make the trip to the Cineplex or to Classic Video Rental to actually see it for ourselves. Time went by and with the hum-drum of day to day work and survival; it went back onto the back-burners of memory; only to occasionally be put ever so briefly into the spotlight; via its being listed in the Weekly Movies on TV listings. FINALLY last evening, Fox Movie Channel had it on. It was Saturday, February 21st, In the Year of Our Lord 2009. Quite appropriately, this was Oscar Night Eve. We would not only have seen a great, low budget film; but also it provided an excellent way of contrasting a brilliant piece of Cinematic Art, as opposed to some of the out and out schlock that passes for a Movie nowadays. TODAY'S sacrificial lamb and Ryan Film Hall of Fame Inductee, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN (Brothers McMullen Productions/Marlboro Road Gang Productions/Videpgraphy Productions/Fox Searchlight Pictures, 1995) is a great example of a precursor of great things to come. Though the film has specificity of both setting and ethnicity of the principals; and yet, the story, the incidents and the final outcome of the story are all truly universally applicable to any and all segments of this or any other society. BEING a practicing Catholic of at least half Irish Descent (the other 50% being of the Teutonic Persuasion), we were able to truly identify with the characters, setting and situations in the movie. Our background was in Blue Collar (Proletariat to you Left Wingers), Parochial (Catholic) Schools and Democratic Political affiliations*. As a 14 year Irish High Schooler, old former Altar Boy,** it was a joyous day when JFK got the Democratic nod and nomination in 1960; with ever even more ecstatic days ahead when he and running mate, LBJ, won the election that November. ALL of the previous exposition was necessary to lay the groundwork for the proof; being that we understand everything here. So, we get it! Enough said already! EXPERTLY mixing all of the problems that we all face as we are growing deeper into adulthood and leaving the days adolescence far behind us, the Writer-Director-Co-Producer-Lead Actor, Edward Burns, manages to touch all of the bases in the slightly over 1 &frac12; Hours Running Time (98 minutes, to be exact). Adding fuel to the fire is the lack of any real family support; with the McMullen Clan being ever so dysfunctional. It is revealed that following the death of their abusive, alcoholic Father that their Mother split, going back to Ireland. It appears, as she confided to her Sons that there was someone she truly loved there. She had married Old Man McMullen because he had knocked her up! (Hell, where were these Colleens when I needed them!) SERIOUSLY though folks, Mr. Burns manages to blend all aspects of life with generous helpings of love, self-preservation, sex, acceptance and security being related in serious, humorous and even in pathetic moods. There seems to have been a natural instinct driving Mr. Edward Burns in his piecing together this jigsaw puzzle. AND to think, Mr. Burns reportedly brought it all together for a measly $17,000.00; which wouldn't pay a catering bill on a weeks worth of shooting on a major film. This BROTHERS McMULLEN project has proved his worth as Actor, Writer, Producer and Director. MOST importantly, this film proved young Burns' talents in possibly the most important area; that being 'the Bottom Line' A$ we all know, thi$ i$ probably the mo$t important a$pect of making the Movie$ a$ it concern$ all of the $uit$ back at the Big $tudio$ and Di$tributor$! NOTE: * In viewing things in a generalized manner, some have sized me up as: 1. Irish, 2. Catholic, 3. Democrat, with a 4. City Job (Chicago Cop for 35 years). Although I am: only half Irish (the other half of the pedigree being German), a Conservative and a card-carrying Republican. Ma & Pa, the Late Clement and Bertha Ryan, both loyal New Deal Democrats, are surely resting quite uneasily with what their Democratic Party has become and what these socialists are trying to do with our Republic. NOTE: ** Yeah, I was an Altar Boy, at St. Theodore Parish in Chicago, circa 1957-59. And just to set the record straight, honest, Fr. Chambers, I never drank any Altar Wine. POODLE SCHNITZ!!

    I am a man who is of Irish decent, has an older brother who I am still close with but used to fight with (physically) constantly, and grew up in the Northeast, so I felt more of a familiarity towards this film than people in other demographics. For those reasons alone, this film holds a special place in my movie-loving heart than others I have seen before. Having said that, you don't have to be Irish-American or even male to love this movie. Sure, it looks grainy even on DVD, but any movie fan can tell you that it's not how clear a movie is or how much it costs, but how good the characters are or the story is. For this movie, both criteria was met. Edwards Burns wrote this film brilliantly, for starters. Burns wrote himself as the funnyman, and he did a great job with that role. He has some very memorable lines, most especially the part where he's talking to his younger brother Patrick (Mike McGlone) about women's ways while using a banana. Other writers would have stooped really low with such a prop, but Burns used it metaphorically in a way that was both funny and smart. He also had great chemistry with Maxine Bahns. Of course, Burns didn't leave all the funny lines to himself. Mike McGlone is also very good as Patrick, the younger brother who uses his Catholic upbringing as an excuse not to marry his longtime girlfriend. His character is perhaps the most interesting because he's so complex and has many contradictory qualities: he loves but is afraid to commit, he's religious but abides by the rules when convenient, and he's smart but does really dumb things. Contrast that performance to his role in Burns' followup, "She's The One", and you'll see that McGlone is one of the most underrated actors working today. Of course, with the movie centering around the three brothers, not mentioning Jack Mulcahy as older brother Jack would be blasphemous. Mulcahy played a very good straight man to Burns and McGlone. The movie makes you believe in the beginning that he has everything together, but he eventually loses it. However, he does so in an understated way that seems very realistic in a lot of ways. You'd have to see the movie to find out. There's not too much else to say about the movie: it just worked! The dialogue was brilliantly written and perfectly executed by the entire cast, the situations were entirely believable, and the on-location shooting in New York was a brilliant move on Burns' part. It's as if New York was its own character. Being from New England, seeing the New York Yankees clothing some of the cast wore got under my skin a little, but I won't get too picky. Although Edward Burns got his due for this movie (Winner of Best Picture at Sundance, Two Thumbs Up from Siskel & Ebert), he hasn't really gotten the respect he deserves since this film was made. He's directed eight movies as of the date this review has been written, and my guess is that in another ten years, he will earn the same respect as Woody Allen and Albert Brooks from film critics and fans alike. He had a great start as a young independent filmmaker, and I know he'll make more good films as a director as well.

    I just finished watching this on TV. The story is about several weeks in the lives of three bothers. Circumstances (what they are is unimportant) have caused the two younger bachelor brothers to move in with their older married brother and his family. The script explores the relationships between three loving Irish Catholic American brothers, each with a distinctive personality, and the relationships each has with the women in their lives. It's about real love and romance (not the sappy romantic comedy type), fears of commitment, and the twists and turns these men go through in dealing with that aspect of their lives. Their Catholicism has a lot to do with the story. At one point Patrick says to his Jewish girl friend, "I go to Church every week; you go to Temple only once or twice a year." She replies, "Yes, but your religion is crazy." Although the most religious of the three, Patrick, goes against the Church's teachings in that he uses condoms; but, he worries about going to Hell should he commit other serious sin. Marriage to all of them means a life-long commitment. Their mother's life set the standard for them. She had lived 35 years in a forced, loveless marriage until her husband passed away. That freed her to go to the man she had been in love with when circumstances caused her to marry the boys' father. Abortion was out of the question, as was divorce. Ed Burns is credited with writing and directing the film and he also is very credible as the middle brother. While the entire cast made their characters seem real, the actor who in my mind stood out is Mike McGlone, who plays Patrick, the youngest brother who has a kind of altar boy personality. Perhaps Ed Burns' choice of camera angles gets some of the credit for making his performance particularly memorable, but McGlone brought something special to that part.

    Fifteen thousand pounds to many is a great deal of money, but in Hollywood it'd barely make a runner's salary. So really it's an unbelievable effort to produce a movie for this amount of money and win a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995, as well as recognition for Ed Burns as an all-round director/actor/producer/writer extraordinaire. The end product being The Brothers McMullen; a project made literally in his own backyard, using his own friends and associates as his crew (such as his 'then' girlfriend who is his girlfriend in the film and his friend). The protagonist is Burns' character Barry, the middle brother, who is the wittiest, has the sharpest lines, and many would think the film is partly autobiographical because of this. Barry is a writer, jumps from woman to woman, makes wise guy remarks, and then he meets Audrey, played by Maxine Bahns, and is forced to get over his fear of commitment. How does he deal with it? Jack, the older brother, is a middle-aged teacher, who's quieter and loves his wife, but has to deal with the feelings of infidelity. How does he deal with it? Then there's Patrick, the younger religious sibling, a do-gooder who's soon to get married into a Jewish family, but he gets cold feet. Then hot feet. Then cold feet. He then gets his fianc&eacute; pregnant. Then he meets someone else. He then has to deal has to deal with the guilt. Or does he learn not to? Three very different brothers, the three Irish New Yorkers feed each other their advice and wisdom of love. It's not an original plot, but it works. Conversations flow from JFK, women, families, love, alcohol, their violent father, to family bonding, with a whole lot of swearing in between and Irish fiddle music in the background. Burns is something of a Plastic Paddy. Nevertheless, there's a lot of great word play, the plot isn't pretentious or trying to be too clever. It's heart-warming, without being soppy. Minus points: one can appreciate Burn is an all-rounder, but he should maybe step outside his own box and become a character in the movie  stop writing and starring as himself  it's a bit egotistical. The acting was a bit amateur, especially Maxine Bahns  though this can be forgiven for the fact they were at the time just that - amateurs. The editing was a bit disjointed in places. It doesn't flow as well as it could do. Then again, it only cost, as stated &pound;15,000. It has to be expected. I appreciated it a lot. A debut movie, that cost &pound;15,000, cannot get much better. If you like Irish-American culture, take pleasure of budget movies and enjoy witty rom-coms  try this.

    First time i saw this 10 years ago, i thought it was pretty good. Its been on cable more lately and found myself watching it a couple more times,and its grown on me more. Its funny at times. Also very serious at others. As sorta a non practicing Irish Catholic myself, It brought home allot of situations i can relate to. Its also sorta a NY type comedy, with the language and City backgrounds. Covers allot of relationship topics. I sorta call this a chick flick for guys. None of that stupid comedy/phony romance type movie you often see nowadays. But more real life situation. Little things, like the fight Burns has with his brother over drinking a beer in the morning. Now thats the way it is in real life.

    EDWARD BURNS is the writer/producer/director/actor of this charming piece of casual film-making on a shoestring budget that he turned out twelve years ago, obviously based on characters he cares about and knows intimately. It has the intimate immediacy of MARTY, another such tale about a lonely Brooklyn butcher looking for true love and the right marriage prospect to end his bachelor days. In THE BROTHERS McMULLEN we have MARTY compounded by three--namely, the Irish brothers on Long Island who seem to indulge in endless dialog about life, love and the pursuit of happiness while sipping their favorite beers, each involved in a troublesome relationship that has them questioning their inner conflicts born by a Catholic conscience. It's not exactly up to the Woody Allen standard of such tales, but the dialog is fresh enough and natural, the modest settings are appropriate for the story and the jaunty Irish music on the soundtrack does its job. Nothing complex here. Just a warm, engaging, occasionally funny tale of average guys struggling with their fixed ideas of moral values, each unable to come to terms with inner conflicts--and two of them simply unable to make commitments to the women they love. The film is really carried by the three brothers: EDWARD BURNS as the one least able to commit, and JACK MULCAHY and MIKE McGLONE as his troubled siblings. Summing up: Nothing really special, but it did win a couple of awards at film festivals.

    I came from the same area where Ed Burns grew up and I recognized the house and the street plus the church shown in the movie. The Long Island Rail Road station was Gibson. It brought back a lot of good memories. The movie captured much of the essence of the times and the neighborhood. I loved it. The characters seemed to be just like the people living there. I know many of the actors were from the area though I did not know them. His father being a NYPD Sergeant and his Mom working in the JFK Airport were indicative of many of the people living in this area. The Irish factor was also a sign of the area. My father was also Irish and worked as a Policeman in the same town where the film was shot. Great work. I am so appreciative of the movie.

    Edward Burns took Sundance by storm with this wonderful debut film centering on three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island dealing with love, loss and brotherhood. Burns made the film using a $15,000 loan from his father, casting complete unknowns and shooting on weekends over the course of a year. "The Brothers McMullen" helped independent film become what it is today. Written in the tradition of other no-budget classics "El Mariachi" and "Metropolitan", Burns manages to do something that those films couldn't. While Robert Rodriguez had sharp and witty dialogue, it was the bullets and blood that made "El Mariachi" as exciting as it was. While "Metropolitation" kept you on the edge of your seat for the first half an hour, my interest lagged as the film progressed. "The Brothers McMullen", on the other hand, uses a completely dialogue driven script to excite the audience for the complete duration of the picture. If you're looking for cheap laughs and T&A, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a heart warming indie classic, I'd definitely suggest "The Brothers McMullen".

    Barry and Patrick move back into their old house owned by their third brother, Jack. They each deal with true love, marriage, and infidelity respectively. Whenever you see that dreaded buzzword "highly acclaimed" or worse "darling of critics", you'd be best advised NOT to get your hopes up. If you do you'll be let down time and time again. Such is the case with this film as well. If however you go in expecting a mediocre movie you're still be let down but not nearly as much. This starts off OK, but gets too long winded. And whenever a character has an internal monologue it becomes laughably bad. Overall I wouldn't want to spend time with anyone in the film. So in that way it's like Seinfield, but minus the laughs. However, it still is good for an indy film. My Grade: C+ Where I saw it: Starz Classics

    I just finished watching this on TV. The story is about several weeks in the lives of three bothers. Circumstances (what they are is unimportant) have caused the two younger bachelor brothers to move in with their older married brother and his family. The script explores the relationships between three loving Irish Catholic American brothers, each with a distinctive personality, and the relationships each has with the women in their lives. It's about real love and romance (not the sappy romantic comedy type), fears of commitment, and the twists and turns these men go through in dealing with that aspect of their lives. Their Catholicism has a lot to do with the story. At one point Patrick says to his Jewish girl friend, "I go to Church every week; you go to Temple only once or twice a year." She replies, "Yes, but your religion is crazy." Although the most religious of the three, Patrick, goes against the Church's teachings in that he uses condoms; but, he worries about going to Hell should he commit other serious sin. Marriage to all of them means a life-long commitment. Their mother's life set the standard for them. She had lived 35 years in a forced, loveless marriage until her husband passed away. That freed her to go to the man she had been in love with when circumstances caused her to marry the boys' father. Abortion was out of the question, as was divorce. Ed Burns is credited with writing and directing the film and he also is very credible as the middle brother. While the entire cast made their characters seem real, the actor who in my mind stood out is Mike McGlone, who plays Patrick, the youngest brother who has a kind of altar boy personality. Perhaps Ed Burns' choice of camera angles gets some of the credit for making his performance particularly memorable, but McGlone brought something special to that part.

    Fifteen thousand pounds to many is a great deal of money, but in Hollywood it'd barely make a runner's salary. So really it's an unbelievable effort to produce a movie for this amount of money and win a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995, as well as recognition for Ed Burns as an all-round director/actor/producer/writer extraordinaire. The end product being The Brothers McMullen; a project made literally in his own backyard, using his own friends and associates as his crew (such as his 'then' girlfriend who is his girlfriend in the film and his friend). The protagonist is Burns' character Barry, the middle brother, who is the wittiest, has the sharpest lines, and many would think the film is partly autobiographical because of this. Barry is a writer, jumps from woman to woman, makes wise guy remarks, and then he meets Audrey, played by Maxine Bahns, and is forced to get over his fear of commitment. How does he deal with it? Jack, the older brother, is a middle-aged teacher, who's quieter and loves his wife, but has to deal with the feelings of infidelity. How does he deal with it? Then there's Patrick, the younger religious sibling, a do-gooder who's soon to get married into a Jewish family, but he gets cold feet. Then hot feet. Then cold feet. He then gets his fianc&eacute; pregnant. Then he meets someone else. He then has to deal has to deal with the guilt. Or does he learn not to? Three very different brothers, the three Irish New Yorkers feed each other their advice and wisdom of love. It's not an original plot, but it works. Conversations flow from JFK, women, families, love, alcohol, their violent father, to family bonding, with a whole lot of swearing in between and Irish fiddle music in the background. Burns is something of a Plastic Paddy. Nevertheless, there's a lot of great word play, the plot isn't pretentious or trying to be too clever. It's heart-warming, without being soppy. Minus points: one can appreciate Burn is an all-rounder, but he should maybe step outside his own box and become a character in the movie  stop writing and starring as himself  it's a bit egotistical. The acting was a bit amateur, especially Maxine Bahns  though this can be forgiven for the fact they were at the time just that - amateurs. The editing was a bit disjointed in places. It doesn't flow as well as it could do. Then again, it only cost, as stated &pound;15,000. It has to be expected. I appreciated it a lot. A debut movie, that cost &pound;15,000, cannot get much better. If you like Irish-American culture, take pleasure of budget movies and enjoy witty rom-coms  try this.

    First time i saw this 10 years ago, i thought it was pretty good. Its been on cable more lately and found myself watching it a couple more times,and its grown on me more. Its funny at times. Also very serious at others. As sorta a non practicing Irish Catholic myself, It brought home allot of situations i can relate to. Its also sorta a NY type comedy, with the language and City backgrounds. Covers allot of relationship topics. I sorta call this a chick flick for guys. None of that stupid comedy/phony romance type movie you often see nowadays. But more real life situation. Little things, like the fight Burns has with his brother over drinking a beer in the morning. Now thats the way it is in real life.

    EDWARD BURNS is the writer/producer/director/actor of this charming piece of casual film-making on a shoestring budget that he turned out twelve years ago, obviously based on characters he cares about and knows intimately. It has the intimate immediacy of MARTY, another such tale about a lonely Brooklyn butcher looking for true love and the right marriage prospect to end his bachelor days. In THE BROTHERS McMULLEN we have MARTY compounded by three--namely, the Irish brothers on Long Island who seem to indulge in endless dialog about life, love and the pursuit of happiness while sipping their favorite beers, each involved in a troublesome relationship that has them questioning their inner conflicts born by a Catholic conscience. It's not exactly up to the Woody Allen standard of such tales, but the dialog is fresh enough and natural, the modest settings are appropriate for the story and the jaunty Irish music on the soundtrack does its job. Nothing complex here. Just a warm, engaging, occasionally funny tale of average guys struggling with their fixed ideas of moral values, each unable to come to terms with inner conflicts--and two of them simply unable to make commitments to the women they love. The film is really carried by the three brothers: EDWARD BURNS as the one least able to commit, and JACK MULCAHY and MIKE McGLONE as his troubled siblings. Summing up: Nothing really special, but it did win a couple of awards at film festivals.

    I came from the same area where Ed Burns grew up and I recognized the house and the street plus the church shown in the movie. The Long Island Rail Road station was Gibson. It brought back a lot of good memories. The movie captured much of the essence of the times and the neighborhood. I loved it. The characters seemed to be just like the people living there. I know many of the actors were from the area though I did not know them. His father being a NYPD Sergeant and his Mom working in the JFK Airport were indicative of many of the people living in this area. The Irish factor was also a sign of the area. My father was also Irish and worked as a Policeman in the same town where the film was shot. Great work. I am so appreciative of the movie.

    Edward Burns took Sundance by storm with this wonderful debut film centering on three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island dealing with love, loss and brotherhood. Burns made the film using a $15,000 loan from his father, casting complete unknowns and shooting on weekends over the course of a year. "The Brothers McMullen" helped independent film become what it is today. Written in the tradition of other no-budget classics "El Mariachi" and "Metropolitan", Burns manages to do something that those films couldn't. While Robert Rodriguez had sharp and witty dialogue, it was the bullets and blood that made "El Mariachi" as exciting as it was. While "Metropolitation" kept you on the edge of your seat for the first half an hour, my interest lagged as the film progressed. "The Brothers McMullen", on the other hand, uses a completely dialogue driven script to excite the audience for the complete duration of the picture. If you're looking for cheap laughs and T&A, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a heart warming indie classic, I'd definitely suggest "The Brothers McMullen".

    Barry and Patrick move back into their old house owned by their third brother, Jack. They each deal with true love, marriage, and infidelity respectively. Whenever you see that dreaded buzzword "highly acclaimed" or worse "darling of critics", you'd be best advised NOT to get your hopes up. If you do you'll be let down time and time again. Such is the case with this film as well. If however you go in expecting a mediocre movie you're still be let down but not nearly as much. This starts off OK, but gets too long winded. And whenever a character has an internal monologue it becomes laughably bad. Overall I wouldn't want to spend time with anyone in the film. So in that way it's like Seinfield, but minus the laughs. However, it still is good for an indy film. My Grade: C+ Where I saw it: Starz Classics

    I have no idea why this movie was ever made. It's truly horrible. I mean what was the point? Lapsed Catholics are troubled people? None of the male characters is the least bit interesting or sympathetic. They are all total zeros. Given that the three brothers are absolute jerks, the contrived, blissful happy ending which is completely predictable is not in the least bit warranted in any of the three couples lives. The profanity is on a par with the number of beers consumed. I think I should have had a few before sitting down to this. The wife of the eldest brother who is married is about the only interesting character in the movie. She should apply for sainthood for sticking with a cheating husband. As far as I am concerned this is just more Catholic bashing from that Hollywood can not get enough of. Don't spend a minute watching this dreadful film.

    HAVING heard so much about this Film from our 2 Daughters (Jenn & Michelle Ryan), we never did make the trip to the Cineplex or to Classic Video Rental to actually see it for ourselves. Time went by and with the hum-drum of day to day work and survival; it went back onto the back-burners of memory; only to occasionally be put ever so briefly into the spotlight; via its being listed in the Weekly Movies on TV listings. FINALLY last evening, Fox Movie Channel had it on. It was Saturday, February 21st, In the Year of Our Lord 2009. Quite appropriately, this was Oscar Night Eve. We would not only have seen a great, low budget film; but also it provided an excellent way of contrasting a brilliant piece of Cinematic Art, as opposed to some of the out and out schlock that passes for a Movie nowadays. TODAY'S sacrificial lamb and Ryan Film Hall of Fame Inductee, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN (Brothers McMullen Productions/Marlboro Road Gang Productions/Videpgraphy Productions/Fox Searchlight Pictures, 1995) is a great example of a precursor of great things to come. Though the film has specificity of both setting and ethnicity of the principals; and yet, the story, the incidents and the final outcome of the story are all truly universally applicable to any and all segments of this or any other society. BEING a practicing Catholic of at least half Irish Descent (the other 50% being of the Teutonic Persuasion), we were able to truly identify with the characters, setting and situations in the movie. Our background was in Blue Collar (Proletariat to you Left Wingers), Parochial (Catholic) Schools and Democratic Political affiliations*. As a 14 year Irish High Schooler, old former Altar Boy,** it was a joyous day when JFK got the Democratic nod and nomination in 1960; with ever even more ecstatic days ahead when he and running mate, LBJ, won the election that November. ALL of the previous exposition was necessary to lay the groundwork for the proof; being that we understand everything here. So, we get it! Enough said already! EXPERTLY mixing all of the problems that we all face as we are growing deeper into adulthood and leaving the days adolescence far behind us, the Writer-Director-Co-Producer-Lead Actor, Edward Burns, manages to touch all of the bases in the slightly over 1 &frac12; Hours Running Time (98 minutes, to be exact). Adding fuel to the fire is the lack of any real family support; with the McMullen Clan being ever so dysfunctional. It is revealed that following the death of their abusive, alcoholic Father that their Mother split, going back to Ireland. It appears, as she confided to her Sons that there was someone she truly loved there. She had married Old Man McMullen because he had knocked her up! (Hell, where were these Colleens when I needed them!) SERIOUSLY though folks, Mr. Burns manages to blend all aspects of life with generous helpings of love, self-preservation, sex, acceptance and security being related in serious, humorous and even in pathetic moods. There seems to have been a natural instinct driving Mr. Edward Burns in his piecing together this jigsaw puzzle. AND to think, Mr. Burns reportedly brought it all together for a measly $17,000.00; which wouldn't pay a catering bill on a weeks worth of shooting on a major film. This BROTHERS McMULLEN project has proved his worth as Actor, Writer, Producer and Director. MOST importantly, this film proved young Burns' talents in possibly the most important area; that being 'the Bottom Line' A$ we all know, thi$ i$ probably the mo$t important a$pect of making the Movie$ a$ it concern$ all of the $uit$ back at the Big $tudio$ and Di$tributor$! NOTE: * In viewing things in a generalized manner, some have sized me up as: 1. Irish, 2. Catholic, 3. Democrat, with a 4. City Job (Chicago Cop for 35 years). Although I am: only half Irish (the other half of the pedigree being German), a Conservative and a card-carrying Republican. Ma & Pa, the Late Clement and Bertha Ryan, both loyal New Deal Democrats, are surely resting quite uneasily with what their Democratic Party has become and what these socialists are trying to do with our Republic. NOTE: ** Yeah, I was an Altar Boy, at St. Theodore Parish in Chicago, circa 1957-59. And just to set the record straight, honest, Fr. Chambers, I never drank any Altar Wine. POODLE SCHNITZ!!

    I am a man who is of Irish decent, has an older brother who I am still close with but used to fight with (physically) constantly, and grew up in the Northeast, so I felt more of a familiarity towards this film than people in other demographics. For those reasons alone, this film holds a special place in my movie-loving heart than others I have seen before. Having said that, you don't have to be Irish-American or even male to love this movie. Sure, it looks grainy even on DVD, but any movie fan can tell you that it's not how clear a movie is or how much it costs, but how good the characters are or the story is. For this movie, both criteria was met. Edwards Burns wrote this film brilliantly, for starters. Burns wrote himself as the funnyman, and he did a great job with that role. He has some very memorable lines, most especially the part where he's talking to his younger brother Patrick (Mike McGlone) about women's ways while using a banana. Other writers would have stooped really low with such a prop, but Burns used it metaphorically in a way that was both funny and smart. He also had great chemistry with Maxine Bahns. Of course, Burns didn't leave all the funny lines to himself. Mike McGlone is also very good as Patrick, the younger brother who uses his Catholic upbringing as an excuse not to marry his longtime girlfriend. His character is perhaps the most interesting because he's so complex and has many contradictory qualities: he loves but is afraid to commit, he's religious but abides by the rules when convenient, and he's smart but does really dumb things. Contrast that performance to his role in Burns' followup, "She's The One", and you'll see that McGlone is one of the most underrated actors working today. Of course, with the movie centering around the three brothers, not mentioning Jack Mulcahy as older brother Jack would be blasphemous. Mulcahy played a very good straight man to Burns and McGlone. The movie makes you believe in the beginning that he has everything together, but he eventually loses it. However, he does so in an understated way that seems very realistic in a lot of ways. You'd have to see the movie to find out. There's not too much else to say about the movie: it just worked! The dialogue was brilliantly written and perfectly executed by the entire cast, the situations were entirely believable, and the on-location shooting in New York was a brilliant move on Burns' part. It's as if New York was its own character. Being from New England, seeing the New York Yankees clothing some of the cast wore got under my skin a little, but I won't get too picky. Although Edward Burns got his due for this movie (Winner of Best Picture at Sundance, Two Thumbs Up from Siskel & Ebert), he hasn't really gotten the respect he deserves since this film was made. He's directed eight movies as of the date this review has been written, and my guess is that in another ten years, he will earn the same respect as Woody Allen and Albert Brooks from film critics and fans alike. He had a great start as a young independent filmmaker, and I know he'll make more good films as a director as well.

None of the male characters is the least bit interesting or sympathetic. They are all total zeros. Given that the three brothers are absolute jerks, the contrived, blissful happy ending which is completely predictable is not in the least bit warranted in any of the three couples lives. The profanity is on a par with the number of beers consumed. I think I should have had a few before sitting down to this. The wife of the eldest brother who is married is about the only interesting character in the movie. She should apply for sainthood for sticking with a cheating husband. As far as I am concerned this is just more Catholic bashing from that Hollywood can not get enough of. Don't spend a minute watching this dreadful film.

    HAVING heard so much about this Film from our 2 Daughters (Jenn & Michelle Ryan), we never did make the trip to the Cineplex or to Classic Video Rental to actually see it for ourselves. Time went by and with the hum-drum of day to day work and survival; it went back onto the back-burners of memory; only to occasionally be put ever so briefly into the spotlight; via its being listed in the Weekly Movies on TV listings. FINALLY last evening, Fox Movie Channel had it on. It was Saturday, February 21st, In the Year of Our Lord 2009. Quite appropriately, this was Oscar Night Eve. We would not only have seen a great, low budget film; but also it provided an excellent way of contrasting a brilliant piece of Cinematic Art, as opposed to some of the out and out schlock that passes for a Movie nowadays. TODAY'S sacrificial lamb and Ryan Film Hall of Fame Inductee, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN (Brothers McMullen Productions/Marlboro Road Gang Productions/Videpgraphy Productions/Fox Searchlight Pictures, 1995) is a great example of a precursor of great things to come. Though the film has specificity of both setting and ethnicity of the principals; and yet, the story, the incidents and the final outcome of the story are all truly universally applicable to any and all segments of this or any other society. BEING a practicing Catholic of at least half Irish Descent (the other 50% being of the Teutonic Persuasion), we were able to truly identify with the characters, setting and situations in the movie. Our background was in Blue Collar (Proletariat to you Left Wingers), Parochial (Catholic) Schools and Democratic Political affiliations*. As a 14 year Irish High Schooler, old former Altar Boy,** it was a joyous day when JFK got the Democratic nod and nomination in 1960; with ever even more ecstatic days ahead when he and running mate, LBJ, won the election that November. ALL of the previous exposition was necessary to lay the groundwork for the proof; being that we understand everything here. So, we get it! Enough said already! EXPERTLY mixing all of the problems that we all face as we are growing deeper into adulthood and leaving the days adolescence far behind us, the Writer-Director-Co-Producer-Lead Actor, Edward Burns, manages to touch all of the bases in the slightly over 1 &frac12; Hours Running Time (98 minutes, to be exact). Adding fuel to the fire is the lack of any real family support; with the McMullen Clan being ever so dysfunctional. It is revealed that following the death of their abusive, alcoholic Father that their Mother split, going back to Ireland. It appears, as she confided to her Sons that there was someone she truly loved there. She had married Old Man McMullen because he had knocked her up! (Hell, where were these Colleens when I needed them!) SERIOUSLY though folks, Mr. Burns manages to blend all aspects of life with generous helpings of love, self-preservation, sex, acceptance and security being related in serious, humorous and even in pathetic moods. There seems to have been a natural instinct driving Mr. Edward Burns in his piecing together this jigsaw puzzle. AND to think, Mr. Burns reportedly brought it all together for a measly $17,000.00; which wouldn't pay a catering bill on a weeks worth of shooting on a major film. This BROTHERS McMULLEN project has proved his worth as Actor, Writer, Producer and Director. MOST importantly, this film proved young Burns' talents in possibly the most important area; that being 'the Bottom Line' A$ we all know, thi$ i$ probably the mo$t important a$pect of making the Movie$ a$ it concern$ all of the $uit$ back at the Big $tudio$ and Di$tributor$! NOTE: * In viewing things in a generalized manner, some have sized me up as: 1. Irish, 2. Catholic, 3. Democrat, with a 4. City Job (Chicago Cop for 35 years). Although I am: only half Irish (the other half of the pedigree being German), a Conservative and a card-carrying Republican. Ma & Pa, the Late Clement and Bertha Ryan, both loyal New Deal Democrats, are surely resting quite uneasily with what their Democratic Party has become and what these socialists are trying to do with our Republic. NOTE: ** Yeah, I was an Altar Boy, at St. Theodore Parish in Chicago, circa 1957-59. And just to set the record straight, honest, Fr. Chambers, I never drank any Altar Wine. POODLE SCHNITZ!!

    I am a man who is of Irish decent, has an older brother who I am still close with but used to fight with (physically) constantly, and grew up in the Northeast, so I felt more of a familiarity towards this film than people in other demographics. For those reasons alone, this film holds a special place in my movie-loving heart than others I have seen before. Having said that, you don't have to be Irish-American or even male to love this movie. Sure, it looks grainy even on DVD, but any movie fan can tell you that it's not how clear a movie is or how much it costs, but how good the characters are or the story is. For this movie, both criteria was met. Edwards Burns wrote this film brilliantly, for starters. Burns wrote himself as the funnyman, and he did a great job with that role. He has some very memorable lines, most especially the part where he's talking to his younger brother Patrick (Mike McGlone) about women's ways while using a banana. Other writers would have stooped really low with such a prop, but Burns used it metaphorically in a way that was both funny and smart. He also had great chemistry with Maxine Bahns. Of course, Burns didn't leave all the funny lines to himself. Mike McGlone is also very good as Patrick, the younger brother who uses his Catholic upbringing as an excuse not to marry his longtime girlfriend. His character is perhaps the most interesting because he's so complex and has many contradictory qualities: he loves but is afraid to commit, he's religious but abides by the rules when convenient, and he's smart but does really dumb things. Contrast that performance to his role in Burns' followup, "She's The One", and you'll see that McGlone is one of the most underrated actors working today. Of course, with the movie centering around the three brothers, not mentioning Jack Mulcahy as older brother Jack would be blasphemous. Mulcahy played a very good straight man to Burns and McGlone. The movie makes you believe in the beginning that he has everything together, but he eventually loses it. However, he does so in an understated way that seems very realistic in a lot of ways. You'd have to see the movie to find out. There's not too much else to say about the movie: it just worked! The dialogue was brilliantly written and perfectly executed by the entire cast, the situations were entirely believable, and the on-location shooting in New York was a brilliant move on Burns' part. It's as if New York was its own character. Being from New England, seeing the New York Yankees clothing some of the cast wore got under my skin a little, but I won't get too picky. Although Edward Burns got his due for this movie (Winner of Best Picture at Sundance, Two Thumbs Up from Siskel & Ebert), he hasn't really gotten the respect he deserves since this film was made. He's directed eight movies as of the date this review has been written, and my guess is that in another ten years, he will earn the same respect as Woody Allen and Albert Brooks from film critics and fans alike. He had a great start as a young independent filmmaker, and I know he'll make more good films as a director as well.

    I just finished watching this on TV. The story is about several weeks in the lives of three bothers. Circumstances (what they are is unimportant) have caused the two younger bachelor brothers to move in with their older married brother and his family. The script explores the relationships between three loving Irish Catholic American brothers, each with a distinctive personality, and the relationships each has with the women in their lives. It's about real love and romance (not the sappy romantic comedy type), fears of commitment, and the twists and turns these men go through in dealing with that aspect of their lives. Their Catholicism has a lot to do with the story. At one point Patrick says to his Jewish girl friend, "I go to Church every week; you go to Temple only once or twice a year." She replies, "Yes, but your religion is crazy." Although the most religious of the three, Patrick, goes against the Church's teachings in that he uses condoms; but, he worries about going to Hell should he commit other serious sin. Marriage to all of them means a life-long commitment. Their mother's life set the standard for them. She had lived 35 years in a forced, loveless marriage until her husband passed away. That freed her to go to the man she had been in love with when circumstances caused her to marry the boys' father. Abortion was out of the question, as was divorce. Ed Burns is credited with writing and directing the film and he also is very credible as the middle brother. While the entire cast made their characters seem real, the actor who in my mind stood out is Mike McGlone, who plays Patrick, the youngest brother who has a kind of altar boy personality. Perhaps Ed Burns' choice of camera angles gets some of the credit for making his performance particularly memorable, but McGlone brought something special to that part.

    Fifteen thousand pounds to many is a great deal of money, but in Hollywood it'd barely make a runner's salary. So really it's an unbelievable effort to produce a movie for this amount of money and win a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995, as well as recognition for Ed Burns as an all-round director/actor/producer/writer extraordinaire. The end product being The Brothers McMullen; a project made literally in his own backyard, using his own friends and associates as his crew (such as his 'then' girlfriend who is his girlfriend in the film and his friend). The protagonist is Burns' character Barry, the middle brother, who is the wittiest, has the sharpest lines, and many would think the film is partly autobiographical because of this. Barry is a writer, jumps from woman to woman, makes wise guy remarks, and then he meets Audrey, played by Maxine Bahns, and is forced to get over his fear of commitment. How does he deal with it? Jack, the older brother, is a middle-aged teacher, who's quieter and loves his wife, but has to deal with the feelings of infidelity. How does he deal with it? Then there's Patrick, the younger religious sibling, a do-gooder who's soon to get married into a Jewish family, but he gets cold feet. Then hot feet. Then cold feet. He then gets his fianc&eacute; pregnant. Then he meets someone else. He then has to deal has to deal with the guilt. Or does he learn not to? Three very different brothers, the three Irish New Yorkers feed each other their advice and wisdom of love. It's not an original plot, but it works. Conversations flow from JFK, women, families, love, alcohol, their violent father, to family bonding, with a whole lot of swearing in between and Irish fiddle music in the background. Burns is something of a Plastic Paddy. Nevertheless, there's a lot of great word play, the plot isn't pretentious or trying to be too clever. It's heart-warming, without being soppy. Minus points: one can appreciate Burn is an all-rounder, but he should maybe step outside his own box and become a character in the movie  stop writing and starring as himself  it's a bit egotistical. The acting was a bit amateur, especially Maxine Bahns  though this can be forgiven for the fact they were at the time just that - amateurs. The editing was a bit disjointed in places. It doesn't flow as well as it could do. Then again, it only cost, as stated &pound;15,000. It has to be expected. I appreciated it a lot. A debut movie, that cost &pound;15,000, cannot get much better. If you like Irish-American culture, take pleasure of budget movies and enjoy witty rom-coms  try this.

    First time i saw this 10 years ago, i thought it was pretty good. Its been on cable more lately and found myself watching it a couple more times,and its grown on me more. Its funny at times. Also very serious at others. As sorta a non practicing Irish Catholic myself, It brought home allot of situations i can relate to. Its also sorta a NY type comedy, with the language and City backgrounds. Covers allot of relationship topics. I sorta call this a chick flick for guys. None of that stupid comedy/phony romance type movie you often see nowadays. But more real life situation. Little things, like the fight Burns has with his brother over drinking a beer in the morning. Now thats the way it is in real life.

    EDWARD BURNS is the writer/producer/director/actor of this charming piece of casual film-making on a shoestring budget that he turned out twelve years ago, obviously based on characters he cares about and knows intimately. It has the intimate immediacy of MARTY, another such tale about a lonely Brooklyn butcher looking for true love and the right marriage prospect to end his bachelor days. In THE BROTHERS McMULLEN we have MARTY compounded by three--namely, the Irish brothers on Long Island who seem to indulge in endless dialog about life, love and the pursuit of happiness while sipping their favorite beers, each involved in a troublesome relationship that has them questioning their inner conflicts born by a Catholic conscience. It's not exactly up to the Woody Allen standard of such tales, but the dialog is fresh enough and natural, the modest settings are appropriate for the story and the jaunty Irish music on the soundtrack does its job. Nothing complex here. Just a warm, engaging, occasionally funny tale of average guys struggling with their fixed ideas of moral values, each unable to come to terms with inner conflicts--and two of them simply unable to make commitments to the women they love. The film is really carried by the three brothers: EDWARD BURNS as the one least able to commit, and JACK MULCAHY and MIKE McGLONE as his troubled siblings. Summing up: Nothing really special, but it did win a couple of awards at film festivals.

    I came from the same area where Ed Burns grew up and I recognized the house and the street plus the church shown in the movie. The Long Island Rail Road station was Gibson. It brought back a lot of good memories. The movie captured much of the essence of the times and the neighborhood. I loved it. The characters seemed to be just like the people living there. I know many of the actors were from the area though I did not know them. His father being a NYPD Sergeant and his Mom working in the JFK Airport were indicative of many of the people living in this area. The Irish factor was also a sign of the area. My father was also Irish and worked as a Policeman in the same town where the film was shot. Great work. I am so appreciative of the movie.

    Edward Burns took Sundance by storm with this wonderful debut film centering on three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island dealing with love, loss and brotherhood. Burns made the film using a $15,000 loan from his father, casting complete unknowns and shooting on weekends over the course of a year. "The Brothers McMullen" helped independent film become what it is today. Written in the tradition of other no-budget classics "El Mariachi" and "Metropolitan", Burns manages to do something that those films couldn't. While Robert Rodriguez had sharp and witty dialogue, it was the bullets and blood that made "El Mariachi" as exciting as it was. While "Metropolitation" kept you on the edge of your seat for the first half an hour, my interest lagged as the film progressed. "The Brothers McMullen", on the other hand, uses a completely dialogue driven script to excite the audience for the complete duration of the picture. If you're looking for cheap laughs and T&A, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a heart warming indie classic, I'd definitely suggest "The Brothers McMullen".

    Barry and Patrick move back into their old house owned by their third brother, Jack. They each deal with true love, marriage, and infidelity respectively. Whenever you see that dreaded buzzword "highly acclaimed" or worse "darling of critics", you'd be best advised NOT to get your hopes up. If you do you'll be let down time and time again. Such is the case with this film as well. If however you go in expecting a mediocre movie you're still be let down but not nearly as much. This starts off OK, but gets too long winded. And whenever a character has an internal monologue it becomes laughably bad. Overall I wouldn't want to spend time with anyone in the film. So in that way it's like Seinfield, but minus the laughs. However, it still is good for an indy film. My Grade: C+ Where I saw it: Starz Classics
