    Speechless is a sweet, polite, unboisterous romantic-comedy. Two talkative speechwriters working on opposing sides of the same campaign leave each other speechless, by end's time. Michael Keaton is like my favorite fellow, he's so lovably funny, and I greatly adore Geena Davis, she's so genuinely sweet. The two have good, appropriately awkward chemistry. Speechless misses the mark at being a slyly poignant romantic-comedy, with bad timing and underdeveloped story context. The writer's vision is lost through poor direction. Speechless has a pace too quickened. The movie speeds along too fast and it's hard to keep up with. The way Keaton and Davis fall for each other at the beginning is a bit unpassioned. Speechless has a nice, easygoing feel. It's a great date movie, for what it is, very nice and very enjoyable. Speechless assertively speaks the sweet language of love, and it's really good for it.

    I really liked this film and there are multiple reasons behind it. First unlike many films where the word Republican = Evil, and Democrats = Saints this film has both Senatorial candidates as being corrupt, which is fair. Next Keaton & Davis have real chemistry together, and are both on the same level (Which is rare these days. Usually it is one is rich and the other is poor, one is smart and the other is dumb, or something like that). It is also funny, (Spoiler ahead: The part when they find out what the other does for a living at the school (And the reaction of the teacher and kids) is worth watching in and of itself). Finally, this is not a "chick flick" which in 99% of cases, is an absolute turn-off from the get go. It is mostly told from Kevin's (Keaton's)point of view, which means that as a straight guy, I could watch it without changing the channel. Frankly, I have seen one too many films with women trying on wedding dresses (Sad to say, these women are not exactly hot to begin with). Is it the best romantic comedy of all-time? No "Blind Date", "Stakeout", "Adventures In Babysitting" & almost anything starring Myrna Loy (Most notably "Libeled Lady & "I Love You Again")are my personal favorites. But it is well worth watching. Highly recommended.

    Speechless Being a speechwriter must be very erotic, since you have to imagine your audience not wearing any clothes. However, the only people that the speechwriters in this romantic-comedy want to see nude are each other. Two insomniac writers, Kevin (Michael Keaton) and Julia (Geena Davis), form a sexual relationship during sleepless nights at an all-night diner. Solidifying their relationship based on the knowledge that each other is in the writing profession, both are later stunned when they find out that they are being pitted against each other on either side of a heated political battle. Matters are made worse when Julia's old flame, a hotshot war correspondent (Christopher Reeve), returns. A sharply written love story that encompasses two strange bedfellows, Speechless delivers both bipartisan belly laughs and relevant musings on working relationships. And while dating a rival speechwriter sounds hot, flirting through the elderly male candidates could get awkward. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    Easy on the mind, on the eyes, and on the ears. Geena Davis and Michael Keaton make the most of the best lines in the script, and support from Christopher Reeve is excellent. The film stutters on occasion and may be ten minutes or so too long, but it manages to keep you interested, just. Watch for the continuity errors when Geena manages to get herself engaged during one short bedtime phone call. The ring that didn't come from the phone!!! And what an appearance by the red Morgan convertible, put through its paces by Davis and Keaton in more than one way. Good for a night in with popcorn, chocs, and ice cream.

    Robert King's intelligent writing, Director Ron Underwood's eased direction & Likable Performances by Keaton & Davis make 'Speechless' a great one-time watch. 'Speechless' has a interesting plot of of two opposites attracting to each other. The protagonists face-off each other as Speech-writers. The political portions, the humorous scenes keep the proceedings alive. The climax has a good twist and penultimate scene does get a smile in your face. If there is something that goes wrong in here, that is clearly it's slow-pace. No it's not boring at all, but yet you feel some portions could've been easily edited, especially the character of the Late Christopher Reeve. But there's no denying that this underrated flick deserves a watch. No it doesn't leave you 'Speechles', but surely manages to entertain.

    I guess you could say this contains a partial spoiler. * * * * I'm a little perplexed at the low ratings most folks seem to give this movie. I think it's because people tend to look at movies as a total product. Me, I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate a classic car, and overlook the rust spots. That's kind of where we are on this movie -- a movie that hits on seven out of eight cylinders. The problem is that romantic comedy is the most difficult of genres, and for most folks, it has to hit on all eight to "work." Viewers think about their feelings; they don't analyze a romantic movie in an intellectual way, and if something doesn't quite work, they leave the theater feeling dissatisfied without knowing exactly why. This movie has so much going for it -- a good premise, clever banter, believable characters, and a romance that doesn't seem forced. And for me, there's a double appeal -- I've worked in the press/political world, and all I can say is I can tell the writers must have been there, too. Was it miscast? Was it shallow? Was the dialog unrealistic? Was everyone too cute? Was the "strange bedfellows" premise beyond belief? Naah. None of that. The problem is the third act. I don't want to give away too much, but we have a scene in a bar in which Michael Keaton is given some interesting information, and he has a choice to make. Now, the movie might have spun in a half-dozen interesting directions from this point -- first time I saw it, I was half-sitting up in my chair, once I recognized where the whole thing was leading. I couldn't tell quite where it was going, but I knew it was going to be mighty interesting. There was plenty of dramatic potential, the sort you always need at the start of the third act in a comedy, to make the ending seem a happy relief. The way it spun out in my mind, I suppose the movie would have gone on for another five or six scenes. But here's the trouble -- the next scene is the big climax at the balloon fiesta, and the producers settled for an ending so simple, so dishonest, so downright cheap, that I'm sure it's the thing that left the bad taste in most moviegoers' mouths. Up to this point the movie was a clever comedy of words and ideas and romance; suddenly we got slapstick. How on earth could something like this have happened? How could writers who had done such a good job up to this point have failed so miserably at the climax? My guess is that they didn't -- my guess is that someone with a complete lack of understanding of the material took a movie with a complex, adult, and somewhat ambiguous ending, something in which there were no heroes and no villains, and decided to "improve" it. Or maybe a different ending was shot, and it didn't test well in Pomona, and the studio tried another approach. Or maybe the studio decided to save a little money by cutting 15 minutes out of the script. But I suspect some big-time tinkering here -- something that basically spoiled the movie for most viewers, and turned a potential classic into a bomb. Wouldn't it be cool if another ending was shot -- and if someday a "director's cut" might be made available? There was so much "right" about this movie, I hated to see it spoiled by a botched last couple of minutes. Erik Smith Olympia, Wash.

    This movie STILL remains my favorite romance film of all time! The yearning; the indecision; the misunderstanding; the confusion; the thrill of having to keep their encounters undercover; the fact they both landed at the same love song (No Se Tu); the "prove it" test Julia gives Kevin; and BEST of all, the SENSE-OF-HUMOR unites all the elements for a PERFECT LOVE story. I truly appreciated the character of Julia because she wasn't your typical woman rescued by a "rich-guy" as most romance movies have it. And how can one not melt for Kevin's vulnerable openness and the fact he was not intimidated by Julia's success but rather appreciated her for it. All my friends can have their "Pride and Prejudice", but I know better than to under-estimate the melting power of a funny guy. I should know, I married one--still chuckling 27 years and counting.

    You see it all coming a mile away. The plot twists, the romance. The break up, the making up. It's obviously supposed to be a pairing like Tracy and Hepburn in Adam's Rib or Pat and Mike and you know it from the opening credits. But the strange part is, it works! (Another strange part is that Chris Reeves looks downright haggard and much older than the other two in a real miscasting. There's a welcomeness for seeing him alive and well again but he looks so much older than Davis and is so miscast in this role it is downright uncomfortable all the way around. Except for two "over the top" spots in the script (besides the miscasting above, Davis dragging the sleeping Keaton around a room and the ending) which is why I gave it several demerits, it really works. There is real chemistry between Keaton and Davis. I'm a big fan of Keaton in his comedy roles anyway and Geena Davis is easy on the eyes but especially sexy in this role for some reason. And that chemistry, Keaton's delivery of some funny lines and getting us through a lot of unfunny ones and Davis being quirkily beautiful (again like Hepburn), as well as their rapport together, makes this an enjoyable investment of time. Especially if you're spending it with a sweetie of your own. A tasty treat in a portion just large enough for two.

    Julia (Geena Davis) is a longtime speechwriter, currently working on a senatorial campaign in New Mexico. Kevin (Michael Keaton) has just been hired to be the speechwriter for the opposing candidate. Both are insomniacs. Late one night, they connect at the hotel shop counter where they are both reaching for a bottle of sleeping pills. Sparks fly furiously. Neither knows the other's occupation. But, how long will it be before this big secret is revealed? And, isn't Julia engaged to a hotshot international correspondent anyway? This is a cute movie in a cactus setting. Davis and Keaton are funny and believable as the ace writers. A scene where they speak/duel before a group of school children is priceless. The supporting cast is nice, the script is quite good, and the costumes and scenery more than adequate. And, yes, the movie has some good messages about politics, wolves in sheeps clothing, and true believers. Although it won't leave anyone speechless, this intelligent, humorous love story delights its target audience very well.

    I gotta admit, when I first saw this film, I didn't like it. I had a chance to watch again (being a BIG Michael Keaton fan), and hey, it's really good. Geena Davis, another wonderful actor, and Keaton, play off one another so well. And it's fun to think back on "Beetlejuice". She and Keaton again. And to watch Christopher Reeves makes one realize how we've lost such a great actor and human being. Watch for the early car scene when they've returned to the hotel early in the morning. It's a hoot. I also loved Charles Martin Smith; he's just good in everything. Remember him? He was the goofy guy in "American Graffiti". Yes, this movie has some corny laughs, but the majority are very funny and Keaton/Davis really connect; they are very believable. Don't miss the scene where Keaton and Reeves are talking around the pool table; that's also a gem. Enjoy this one; it'll make you laugh when you need a laugh.

Yes, this movie has some corny laughs, but the majority are very funny and Keaton/Davis really connect; they are very believable. Don't miss the scene where Keaton and Reeves are talking around the pool table; that's also a gem. Enjoy this one; it'll make you laugh when you need a laugh.

    Speechless is a sweet, polite, unboisterous romantic-comedy. Two talkative speechwriters working on opposing sides of the same campaign leave each other speechless, by end's time. Michael Keaton is like my favorite fellow, he's so lovably funny, and I greatly adore Geena Davis, she's so genuinely sweet. The two have good, appropriately awkward chemistry. Speechless misses the mark at being a slyly poignant romantic-comedy, with bad timing and underdeveloped story context. The writer's vision is lost through poor direction. Speechless has a pace too quickened. The movie speeds along too fast and it's hard to keep up with. The way Keaton and Davis fall for each other at the beginning is a bit unpassioned. Speechless has a nice, easygoing feel. It's a great date movie, for what it is, very nice and very enjoyable. Speechless assertively speaks the sweet language of love, and it's really good for it.

    I really liked this film and there are multiple reasons behind it. First unlike many films where the word Republican = Evil, and Democrats = Saints this film has both Senatorial candidates as being corrupt, which is fair. Next Keaton & Davis have real chemistry together, and are both on the same level (Which is rare these days. Usually it is one is rich and the other is poor, one is smart and the other is dumb, or something like that). It is also funny, (Spoiler ahead: The part when they find out what the other does for a living at the school (And the reaction of the teacher and kids) is worth watching in and of itself). Finally, this is not a "chick flick" which in 99% of cases, is an absolute turn-off from the get go. It is mostly told from Kevin's (Keaton's)point of view, which means that as a straight guy, I could watch it without changing the channel. Frankly, I have seen one too many films with women trying on wedding dresses (Sad to say, these women are not exactly hot to begin with). Is it the best romantic comedy of all-time? No "Blind Date", "Stakeout", "Adventures In Babysitting" & almost anything starring Myrna Loy (Most notably "Libeled Lady & "I Love You Again")are my personal favorites. But it is well worth watching. Highly recommended.

    Speechless Being a speechwriter must be very erotic, since you have to imagine your audience not wearing any clothes. However, the only people that the speechwriters in this romantic-comedy want to see nude are each other. Two insomniac writers, Kevin (Michael Keaton) and Julia (Geena Davis), form a sexual relationship during sleepless nights at an all-night diner. Solidifying their relationship based on the knowledge that each other is in the writing profession, both are later stunned when they find out that they are being pitted against each other on either side of a heated political battle. Matters are made worse when Julia's old flame, a hotshot war correspondent (Christopher Reeve), returns. A sharply written love story that encompasses two strange bedfellows, Speechless delivers both bipartisan belly laughs and relevant musings on working relationships. And while dating a rival speechwriter sounds hot, flirting through the elderly male candidates could get awkward. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    Easy on the mind, on the eyes, and on the ears. Geena Davis and Michael Keaton make the most of the best lines in the script, and support from Christopher Reeve is excellent. The film stutters on occasion and may be ten minutes or so too long, but it manages to keep you interested, just. Watch for the continuity errors when Geena manages to get herself engaged during one short bedtime phone call. The ring that didn't come from the phone!!! And what an appearance by the red Morgan convertible, put through its paces by Davis and Keaton in more than one way. Good for a night in with popcorn, chocs, and ice cream.

    Robert King's intelligent writing, Director Ron Underwood's eased direction & Likable Performances by Keaton & Davis make 'Speechless' a great one-time watch. 'Speechless' has a interesting plot of of two opposites attracting to each other. The protagonists face-off each other as Speech-writers. The political portions, the humorous scenes keep the proceedings alive. The climax has a good twist and penultimate scene does get a smile in your face. If there is something that goes wrong in here, that is clearly it's slow-pace. No it's not boring at all, but yet you feel some portions could've been easily edited, especially the character of the Late Christopher Reeve. But there's no denying that this underrated flick deserves a watch. No it doesn't leave you 'Speechles', but surely manages to entertain.

    I guess you could say this contains a partial spoiler. * * * * I'm a little perplexed at the low ratings most folks seem to give this movie. I think it's because people tend to look at movies as a total product. Me, I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate a classic car, and overlook the rust spots. That's kind of where we are on this movie -- a movie that hits on seven out of eight cylinders. The problem is that romantic comedy is the most difficult of genres, and for most folks, it has to hit on all eight to "work." Viewers think about their feelings; they don't analyze a romantic movie in an intellectual way, and if something doesn't quite work, they leave the theater feeling dissatisfied without knowing exactly why. This movie has so much going for it -- a good premise, clever banter, believable characters, and a romance that doesn't seem forced. And for me, there's a double appeal -- I've worked in the press/political world, and all I can say is I can tell the writers must have been there, too. Was it miscast? Was it shallow? Was the dialog unrealistic? Was everyone too cute? Was the "strange bedfellows" premise beyond belief? Naah. None of that. The problem is the third act. I don't want to give away too much, but we have a scene in a bar in which Michael Keaton is given some interesting information, and he has a choice to make. Now, the movie might have spun in a half-dozen interesting directions from this point -- first time I saw it, I was half-sitting up in my chair, once I recognized where the whole thing was leading. I couldn't tell quite where it was going, but I knew it was going to be mighty interesting. There was plenty of dramatic potential, the sort you always need at the start of the third act in a comedy, to make the ending seem a happy relief. The way it spun out in my mind, I suppose the movie would have gone on for another five or six scenes. But here's the trouble -- the next scene is the big climax at the balloon fiesta, and the producers settled for an ending so simple, so dishonest, so downright cheap, that I'm sure it's the thing that left the bad taste in most moviegoers' mouths. Up to this point the movie was a clever comedy of words and ideas and romance; suddenly we got slapstick. How on earth could something like this have happened? How could writers who had done such a good job up to this point have failed so miserably at the climax? My guess is that they didn't -- my guess is that someone with a complete lack of understanding of the material took a movie with a complex, adult, and somewhat ambiguous ending, something in which there were no heroes and no villains, and decided to "improve" it. Or maybe a different ending was shot, and it didn't test well in Pomona, and the studio tried another approach. Or maybe the studio decided to save a little money by cutting 15 minutes out of the script. But I suspect some big-time tinkering here -- something that basically spoiled the movie for most viewers, and turned a potential classic into a bomb. Wouldn't it be cool if another ending was shot -- and if someday a "director's cut" might be made available? There was so much "right" about this movie, I hated to see it spoiled by a botched last couple of minutes. Erik Smith Olympia, Wash.

    This movie STILL remains my favorite romance film of all time! The yearning; the indecision; the misunderstanding; the confusion; the thrill of having to keep their encounters undercover; the fact they both landed at the same love song (No Se Tu); the "prove it" test Julia gives Kevin; and BEST of all, the SENSE-OF-HUMOR unites all the elements for a PERFECT LOVE story. I truly appreciated the character of Julia because she wasn't your typical woman rescued by a "rich-guy" as most romance movies have it. And how can one not melt for Kevin's vulnerable openness and the fact he was not intimidated by Julia's success but rather appreciated her for it. All my friends can have their "Pride and Prejudice", but I know better than to under-estimate the melting power of a funny guy. I should know, I married one--still chuckling 27 years and counting.

    You see it all coming a mile away. The plot twists, the romance. The break up, the making up. It's obviously supposed to be a pairing like Tracy and Hepburn in Adam's Rib or Pat and Mike and you know it from the opening credits. But the strange part is, it works! (Another strange part is that Chris Reeves looks downright haggard and much older than the other two in a real miscasting. There's a welcomeness for seeing him alive and well again but he looks so much older than Davis and is so miscast in this role it is downright uncomfortable all the way around. Except for two "over the top" spots in the script (besides the miscasting above, Davis dragging the sleeping Keaton around a room and the ending) which is why I gave it several demerits, it really works. There is real chemistry between Keaton and Davis. I'm a big fan of Keaton in his comedy roles anyway and Geena Davis is easy on the eyes but especially sexy in this role for some reason. And that chemistry, Keaton's delivery of some funny lines and getting us through a lot of unfunny ones and Davis being quirkily beautiful (again like Hepburn), as well as their rapport together, makes this an enjoyable investment of time. Especially if you're spending it with a sweetie of your own. A tasty treat in a portion just large enough for two.

    Julia (Geena Davis) is a longtime speechwriter, currently working on a senatorial campaign in New Mexico. Kevin (Michael Keaton) has just been hired to be the speechwriter for the opposing candidate. Both are insomniacs. Late one night, they connect at the hotel shop counter where they are both reaching for a bottle of sleeping pills. Sparks fly furiously. Neither knows the other's occupation. But, how long will it be before this big secret is revealed? And, isn't Julia engaged to a hotshot international correspondent anyway? This is a cute movie in a cactus setting. Davis and Keaton are funny and believable as the ace writers. A scene where they speak/duel before a group of school children is priceless. The supporting cast is nice, the script is quite good, and the costumes and scenery more than adequate. And, yes, the movie has some good messages about politics, wolves in sheeps clothing, and true believers. Although it won't leave anyone speechless, this intelligent, humorous love story delights its target audience very well.

    I gotta admit, when I first saw this film, I didn't like it. I had a chance to watch again (being a BIG Michael Keaton fan), and hey, it's really good. Geena Davis, another wonderful actor, and Keaton, play off one another so well. And it's fun to think back on "Beetlejuice". She and Keaton again. And to watch Christopher Reeves makes one realize how we've lost such a great actor and human being. Watch for the early car scene when they've returned to the hotel early in the morning. It's a hoot. I also loved Charles Martin Smith; he's just good in everything. Remember him? He was the goofy guy in "American Graffiti". Yes, this movie has some corny laughs, but the majority are very funny and Keaton/Davis really connect; they are very believable.
