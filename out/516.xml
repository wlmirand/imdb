    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town.

I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film.

One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays.

But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!

    An American oil company sends a man to Scotland to buy up an entire village where they want to build a refinery. But things don't go as expected. Local Hero is a movie that is genius, pure genius. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. And when the movie was over, I was astonished by what I had seen. This movie is a comedy/drama, which means that while there this a very good amount of laughs, there are also some serious moments as well. Bill Forsyth wrote the screenplay for Local Hero, and not only that, but he also directed the movie, and not one single minute of that work was put to waste, all of it paid off to make this wonderful film. It seems as if Bill Forsyth wanted to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters. Everybody in the movie plays their parts perfectly, and like the movie as a whole, not one single second of the performances are wasted, everybody in the movie could not have possibly done a better job. Peter Reigert plays MacIntyre, a man sent by an oil company to buy a town for a refinery, and ends up becoming attached to the place. Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from The Thick Of It) is Oldsen, a man who becomes MacIntyre's friend. The legendary Burt Lancaster plays Felix Happer, the chief executive of the oil company who appears to be more interested in the sky and astronomy than oil. And to round things out is Denis Lawson, who plays Gordon Urquhart, the owner of the hotel. There are many scenes in the movie that are hilarious, most notably any scene in which Happer is at odds with his "psychopathic" psychiatrist. One of my favorite scenes occurs repeatedly, when Mac and Oldsen are in the hotel restaurant, and this music plays in the back ground, and it doesn't matter what time of day it is, it is always the same music that plays. Every time that that music would begin playing, I would suddenly begin laughing, and I would be laughing hard too. Another thing that I have to mention about the movie is the scenery. The movie was shot on location in Scotland, and you can tell, as the scenery is simply beautiful. And there is a magnificent sequence in which a meteor shower occurs, but the best sequence in the sky that occurs are the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. I would very much love to go to Scotland and see just how beautiful the country really is. But anyway, Local Hero is a treasure of a film, you have definitely got to see it, as you will be in for a delightful time, as well as some laughs too! You will not believe just how wonderful this movie is when you actually see it, you will think that it is actually more than wonderful. I send my applauds to everybody involved with the production of Local Hero for their work on a marvel of a movie. Local Hero is a splendid time guaranteed for everyone, do not miss it. 10/10

    This is a lovely film that comes out of nowhere and captures your imagination. Films of the same ilk are Trout Fishing in the Yemen, Waking Ned Devine, the Decoy Bride, and Field of Dreams. If you like these, you will like this film. It takes a subject of little interest to most, the capitalization of an isolated village in Scotland for profit, and because of brilliant characterization and dialog, creates something lasting that you can comment on 25 years after you watched it for the first time. I don't know why I chose to see this move initially. I do know why I rank it as one of my favorite films. The soundtrack is haunting, with Mark Knoffler at his creative prime. The characters are truly unique, the script natural and intelligent. I loved seeing a senior Burt Lancaster at his very best. That is saying something for a man that stole the scenes in so many great films over his career. The scenery is spectacular and filmed in such a way to convey the both the harshness and the vulnerability of Northern Scotland. - Daryl P.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    One of my all-time favorite movies. Such a sweet, gentle tale with an incredible Mark Knopfler soundtrack. The scene at the end where Mac is back in Houston with all the city noises, posting his pictures in his kitchen and then phoning Furness, reminded me of how I feel every time I come home from Scotland. Timeless and magical. The scene where the pastor distracts Mac while the whole village runs from the church after their meeting is so funny....the whole idea of the village fleecing the big oil company exec who thinks he's fleecing them is wonderful. Little details, like Mac almost getting run over by the same motorcycle every time he sets foot onto the street, and Mac's increasingly casual clothes and the fact that he doesn't even notice when his high-tech watch ends up in a tidal pool, are priceless.

    One of my favorite movies of all time. Acting, humor and no although I did not like the ending much, it was subtle. I watched this for the first time in college, and although many years have passed, and my political view have changed, this movie has stood the test of time in my heart. Loved it, and want to visit the area it was filmed. The humor is exquisite. Mark Knoffler's soundtrack is phenomenal. Ever see him in concert? He play's "going home"- check it out on You Tube. One of his best works ever! If you're in the mood check out another touching film called "Daisy's in December"...similar humor, message will last you a lifetime.

    The story is cynical Knox Oil employer Mac Macintyre is sent to Scotland to buy a village to set up an oil refinery. However, Mac is then swept in by the beauty of Scotland. This film is actually sort of surrealist- for example it includes a mermaid. The film is also a total laugh fest. This film is just so perfect. Some snobs might be reading this review saying "He thinks this is the greatest film of all time, what low taste. Has he seen a Yasujiro Ozu film? What about Tokyo Story?" Don't get me wrong, I love Tokyo Story, it's just it can be rather tedious at times. And why do we watch movies? To be entertained, and Local Hero is certainly entertaining. The performances are also great, especially from Burt Lancaster. But most of the credit for this movie has to go to Bill Forsyth, for his brilliant script an direction. The location scouting is also brilliant.

    When Houston oil executive Mac is told to go to northern Scotland to buy the village that stands where Knox Oil wants to build its new refinery he doesn't think it is an important job; he believes he could do it just as well via telex. When he gets there he initially maintains that view as local lawyer, and hotelier, Gordon Urquhart, tells him that he thinks the locals could be persuaded to sell if the price is right... the truth is they are all keen to sell and understandably want to make sure they get the best price. During his stay there he goes to like the place and its people... but not enough to change his mind about the project; that would be overly clich&eacute;. Mac is accompanied by Scotsman Danny Oldsen who works at the company's Aberdeen office and he does end up somewhat conflicted when he falls for marine researcher Marina who believes Knox wants the site to build a research facility not a refinery. This is a delightful film populated by a fine array of characters including Felix Happer, an oil executive who is more interesting in finding comets; Marina, a web-footed marine researcher; Happer's psychiatrist who believes he is paid to insult his employer; Ben, an old man who lives on the beach and could scupper the project and just about everybody in the town. Director Bill Forsyth did a great job keeping the story fun without slipping into sentimentality... the fate of Mac and Danny's pet rabbit is anything but sentimental; it is funny though! This isn't just a visual treat; the sound is great too with a haunting score from Mark Knopfler, the regular peeping of shorebirds and the occasional roar of RAF Jaguar jets that shatters the tranquillity in a way that stops us from thinking the village is perfect. Peter Riegert puts in a nicely understated performance as Mac which went well with Burt Lancaster's and Denis Lawson's performances as the larger than life Happer and Urquhart and Peter Capaldi is good as Danny. I'd certainly recommend this; the plot might not be deep but it is all the little moments that make it great.

    "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." - Edward Abbey Bill Forsyth directs "Local Hero", one of several films released in the early 1980s credited with rekindling the British film industry. The plot? A gang of big city oilmen attempt to buy up an idyllic Scottish village with the hopes of turning the location into a hotbed of commercial exploitation. One by one this gang convinces our lovable Scottish locals to sell and give up their property, but are stopped in their tracks by an elderly oddball named Ben Knox. Ben refuses to move. The film stars an ageing Burt Lancaster as Felix Happer, the chairman of the oil corporation. His henchman is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert. Both men go to Scotland with the hopes of laying the foundations for dredging, but come away with a deep appreciation for Scotland instead. It's an archetypal anti-urban, anti-corporation comedy, our yuppie, big city slickers falling for the beauty of nature, community, the allure of life in the slow lane and the charms of rural countrysides. If this all sounds familiar ("Cars", "Doc Hollywood", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town", "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but came Down a Mountain", Powell and Pressburger's "I Know Where I'm Going" etc) its because it is, but Forsyth's style is unusual and he delivers the tale as best as it been done. Much of the film watches as the villagers become bewitched with the idea of becoming rich. As their greed grows, MacIntyre begins to shed his materialistic lifestyle. His changes are subtle, and conveyed visually: he stops wearing a tie, he stops wearing a suit altogether, he starts drinking with locals etc. This gentle, affectionate tone permeates the entire film. Forsyth slowly draws out the peculiarities and graces of both his rural folk and city folk and aided by musician Mark Knopfler, creates a mystical quality, a superb sense of location, and memorably contrasts Houston, Texan and Scottish skylines, the latter of which is beautifully enhanced by the Aurora Borealis. Films like this were a dime a dozen in the 80s, reacting against the oil boom, Reaganism, Thatcherism and rise in Yuppie and Wall Street chic. It's one of those films which words like "feel-good", "sentimental" and "heartwarming" are routinely applied to, complete with a fantasy ending in which oil barons stop dredging and start saving communities. This fantasy, of course, does not correlate with our world. Big Oil murders for money and has no moral compass whatsoever. "Local Hero's" style, however, is very special; Michael Mann meets Ken Loach and an 80s synth band. Ironically, Forsyth would give up film directing after finding experiences working in Hollywood to be soulless, greedy and distasteful. He'd retire to the countryside. 8.5/10  Worth two viewings.

    Local Hero is a low-key but interesting British Comedy Drama. Directed by Bill Forsyth, and released in 1983 it has its flaws, but also strengths. 'Mac' Macintyre (Peter Riegert) is a successful, slightly arrogant executive working for Knox Oil and Gas, a large company based in Texas. Putting around the lie that he is Scottish-American (He is actually Hungarian) he is summoned to the offices of the companies boss Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster, in one of his last roles). Happer is looking to open a refinery in Scotland, and sends Mac there to buy out the coastal village of Ferness, Mac isn't particularly keen; he enjoys his comfortable life, and is more at home using machines to negotiate. It is at first glance a fairly predictable film, the plot is somewhat clich&eacute;d, the opening in America is frankly boring, and Mac seems a typical American with few interesting characteristics. But the film quickly picks up pace and becomes very enjoyable, if not completely accomplished. Arriving in Scotland Mac meets up with Danny Oldsen (Peter Capaldi), a representative of Knox's Scottish branch (who can speak 11 languages), visiting Knox's research facility in Aberdeen they see a model of Furness and get an idea of the task that awaits them. Riegert and Capaldi, whilst limited by an occasionally clunky script, and at first, a seemingly predictable narrative, share a convincing chemistry and give good performances. Whilst there Danny notices marine Researcher Marina (Not a particularly inventive surname, but still there are bigger issues in the film) (Jenny Seagrove) captivated by her, she forms the film's love interest, and makes the most of her underwritten role. On the way to Ferness, their car breaks down in heavy fog, giving Mac and Danny time to bond, and showcasing some impressive Scottish scenery (though, there is not surprisingly atrocious weather). Early the next morning Mac finds an injured rabbit, and keeps him as a pet. (Until he is amusingly and rather cruelly disposed of that is) Finally arriving in Ferness, Mac and Danny check into a Hotel run by sex-obsessed Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson, who Portrayed Wedge Antilles in the Original Star Wars trilogy) who also doubles as their accountant (everyone in the village seems to have two jobs). Initially Mac feels somewhat ill at ease in the town, but as time passes he adjusts, coming to respect the quaint ways of the locals. Mac begins to feel guilty about the task he is burdened with, but ironically unknown to him, the locals are more than ready to leave, tired of the hard life, and isolated conditions they endure, only holding out on Urquhart's instructions, who feels he can get a better deal the longer they wait. Filmed and set largely in Scotland, the film uses a real Scottish village (Although the name has been changed), and real Scottish actors, giving an insight into local conditions, and including informative dialogue about the northern lights, and local wildlife. Mac eventually phones Happer, for help. Happer soon arrives, bringing the story to a clich&eacute;d but enjoyable ending. Burt Lancaster has a rather limited amount of screen time, but makes the most of it; his Happer is a very eccentric creation, an obsession with astronomy and some peculiar mannerisms make their mark, as does his rather odd therapist (their relationship provides some very funny moments in the film). In contrast some of the other characters don't have quite so big an impact, many of the locals in the village are given only a few lines, often having a limited, or non-existent purpose in the narrative, largely remaining forgettable. Christopher Royzycki portrays Victor, a cheery Russian Fisherman who periodically visits the village, though the character isn't particularly annoying, his purpose in the story often is: giving out clich&eacute;d advice and engaging in some terrible singing. It's a shame more time wasn't spend on the script, as by and large, the supporting cast give convincing performances, worthier of better dialogue and increased screen time. Director Bill Forsyth doesn't waste time with flashy camera-work, or confusing metaphors, he shoots simply and quickly, guiding the cast to largely impressive performances, and giving the film a bright and breezy tone. A memorable music score is utilised, complementing the story surprisingly well. Local Hero is a film with few laugh out loud moments and a relatively leisurely pace, some viewers may struggle to enjoy the setting or rather predictable plot, whilst others will be uncomfortable with the idea of making a comedy based around the oil industry. But for others the simple, accessible plot, a few instances of inspired comedy, and the odd setting will make this an enjoyable if not truly memorable way to spend some spare time. Coarse language, sexual content, and violence are largely absent as well, making it a suitable watch for anyone above the age of 12. 7/10

    Local Hero was written and directed by Bill Forsyth, and he did a great job. This is humour with soul. Humour with a very large Scotch and Ginger ale. Forsyth gets wonderfully natural performances from the cast and they deliver some very funny lines with aplomb. The personalities of the major players are gradually flushed out, and there are some really "wierd & strange" people to examine here !! Veterans Burt Lancaster and Fulton McKay are brilliant as the total opposites (financially), and the close pals in their love of the night skies. This is one of those movies where the humour is not stupid. Not many of these are made in Hollywood.

    This little gem of a movie is more universally loved than almost any other film I know. More friends cite 'Local Hero' as their quiet favourite and have nothing bad to say about it. At all. It may not be the most dramatically grandiose (though the sight of the Northern Lights in the Highlands certainly counts as such) or the most elaborately scripted, but, boy, does it gather a punch and a half when it comes to sheer charm. There are many reviews here and I haven't read them all but I'm sure there are many that give detailed narrative descriptions. I really want to just add my voice and echo those who also think that Local Hero is one of the best British films since The Third Man. Sure, it has many competitors to that lofty title - Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Queen, The King's Speech and Chariots of Fire all spring to mind. But somehow, this amusing cross between Whisky Galore and Donald Trump Buys a Scottish Golf-course (NOT a real film, I hasten to add!) is more universally appealing and 'different' than any of those. You could show it to both Granny and the Tarantino fan (as I am) and both would be mesmerised and enthralled. It's a pity that director Bill Forsythe has only made two great movies - this and his previous, the debut, Gregory's Girl. His list is short and sparse and hasn't seen an inclusion since the poor sequel to Gregory's Girls, 1994's Gregory's Two Girls. Whatever he's doing now (according to IMDb, he's still alive and is now 66) I wish him success and say to everybody, buy this DVD as he may need the royalties!
