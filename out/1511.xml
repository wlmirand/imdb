    As many of the other reviews suggest, if you have ever been a lefty or if your parents were lefties you will enjoy this film. You really do need to have some familiarity with the vocabulary of socialism in the 1930s and 40s to fully appreciate how good this film is. The German film "Goodbye Lenin!" (2003) touches the same sort of themes. So, anyway, the script well written, literate and just a bit edgy, the way Australian films often are. The back story is wonderful and is ably developed by Sam Neil, Judy Davis and F. Murray Abraham. To my eye the cast has given a back story a wonderful 1940s or 50s feel. Sam Neil is good, as always, and remind me of James Mason. Judy Davis is good the way she is always good and reminded me of Betty Davis. F. Murray Abraham's performance actually reminded me of Claude Raines. This film works on many levels and Richard Roxborough and Rachel Griffiths are very good but I as am more familiar with Russian communist dogma and American films from the 40s and 50s, I am sure I missed a lot when the film turned its attention to contemporary Australian politics and the civil service. I loved the way the "International" was used in the sound tack. Of course it had to be there but I really liked the way it was used here.

    Some Australian movies are crap, but some are actually quite clever. This is one movie that I think is quite clever. It is about a fanatical communist woman who goes on a trip to Russia, sleeps with Stalin, and then returns to Australia and has his baby. It is not a drama but a comedy. This baby, Joseph, grows up to become the splitting image of his father and almost takes over Australia. The thing I find interesting is how Joseph takes over Australia. He is in prison for draft dodging and rescues some people from a fire. For his bravery he is given a full pardon, and with that he makes a speech in favour of giving prison guards better working conditions. With the support of the guards and the police, he is elected head of the police union and uses his control of the police to increase his power. The ending seems to be conclusive, but I think that there is more to it than not. Basically, fearing that her son may be killed, the Joseph's mother tells everybody that he is the son of Stalin. She is then assassinated by somebody that Joseph knew in prison. The connection is made and he is arrested. The problem with that is that with the newspapers printing that he is the son of Stalin is grounds for defamation, and in his position, he can manipulate the DNA tests and make it seem that he is not Stalin's son. Then there is the murder. The link is tenuous, and a guy that is as intelligent and as devious as Joseph will be able to beat the charge and return to his job, all the while eliminating his enemies. This movie is a comedy, and it starts off as one, but as the end nears the pace becomes much less comical and much more serious. The idea about how Joseph takes over Australia is a very plausible one. The creator of the movie obviously put a lot of thought into how it might be done. It is interesting to note how his life is very similar to that of Stalin's. He has a last name that should be changed (Hitler and Stalin), he is in prison for a short time as a political prisoner, and he works his way to the top through bureaucratic manipulation. Hitler and Stalin were both like that, though that is probably not the route of most dictators. Still, I thought that this was a great movie and like some of the ideas that are raised in it.

    Hello, I support the opinion, that "Children of the Revolution" is a drama film - however interwoven with absurd and impossible situations. These do not make a comedy, no more than the scene of Stalin perfuming his underpants. The choice of Stalin as the leading theme seems to be rather arbitrary. It is certainly not a film against left politics. We see the Vietnam antiwar demonstrations, and an Australian secret agent admitting that he is used to liquidate communist agitators. And the dictators Stalin, Beria and Chrutschov remarkably enthuse over American music. Actually the film seems mainly concerned with unconditional faith, human wickedness and relational collusions. The viewer is constantly reminded that things are not what they seem. In this respect the film strongly reminded me of "The Truman story" - but perhaps this association is purely personal. If any, the theme of the film may be a satire on personal authority (on the other hand, in "The Truman story" it is the immersion in the community, with in the end Truman sailing away to freedom and loneliness). I will now summarize the story, which seems allowed since the films lacks a climax or the building up of suspense. However, if you dislike being given away the clues stop reading now. Jane has been brainwashed into an ardent communist by her father, and for the rest of her life remains stuck into this pattern. She marries a man who is apparently attracted to strong women and without proper will. Her son Joe develops an uncanny desire for imprisonment, and gets married to the cop who repeatedly arrested him. During the story it remains unclear who is the real father of Joe. The suspicion that it might be Stalin completely changes Joes character and behavior. As a union leader Joe succeeds in taking over the power and control of the police force. And with the possession of the legitimated force, he gains control over the state. Eventually his mother brings about his fall after revealing to the public the name of his professed father (Stalin). Subsequently she is murdered by what seems to be an Australian fascist, and Joe is once again imprisoned. This final incident would signal that people are commonly held accountable for their parents deeds. I must admit that this unraveling puzzles me, since an obvious connection to the preceding events appears to be absent. This lack of coherence may be due to an unwise attempt to extend the film message, and thus a neglect of focus. It could be called a qualitative weakness of the film, but perhaps I am wrong and I welcome other explanations. Any way, basically the overall aim must have been to reveal the idiocy of unconditional authority, irrespective of its source, either family, communism, fascism or perhaps religion (with Jane as both the virgin mother and Judas). It rattles the belief in mans good nature, and urges to persevere in free and independent thought. Being a fan of realism, for me it was an interesting sidestep but not really my cup of tea. Sincerely yours, Emil Bakkum

    1996 Australian black comedy Children of the Revolution is one of those ideas that sounds better on paper than it plays on screen. It's the Cold War and Judy Davis is a hardline doctrinaire Communist oblivious to sad sack boyfriend Geoffrey Rush's attempts to win her hand because her heart belongs to Josef Stalin. When the dictator gets to see her letters - and more importantly her photo - he invites her to Moscow where a night of passion leaves him dead and her pregnant. Marrying Rush and raising the boy with her ideals (and a thing for getting arrested), he grows up to threaten a real revolution from within the system when he unionises both the Prison Service and the Police, but, as his mounting paranoia about his parentage as his office and his physique slowly merge into mirror images of Stalin, it's not quite the revolution she had in mind... Boasting a good cast and Richard Roxburgh, who is surprisingly adequate for a change, it never really catches fire. The tone is never quite right, leaving some of the best ideas high and dry while too many moments like Beria and Kruschev providing backing vocals for F. Murray Abraham's Stalin's rendition of I Get a Kick Out of You show the actors struggling with scenes that they all-too-clearly know just aren't working. Even Sam Neill occasionally seems unsure of how far to go or hold back as a treble agent of no particular loyalty who may or may not be young Joe's real father but certainly is the one who killed Joe's wife's parents (and their entire village) on Stalin's orders. On the plus side it does offer a role that perfectly suits Judy Davis' traditionally unsympathetic one-note anger for once, though it's Geoffrey Rush who impresses the most, managing to create a character who is both funny and believably human amid the stereotypes. Nice try, but no cigar.

    This film brought tears of joy and laughter to my family when we saw it. I guess you had to be there or you had to be the child of Australian lapsed communist actors in the 1950s to see how wickedly apt Judy Davis' performance was- Lines like "Its hard to plan a revolution with six o'clock closing" had us rolling on the floor. Loved it. Loved Richard Roxburgh. Loved all the cast and in particular loved the premise and the plot. Joe Stalin as the father of this almost physcotic love child. All the innocence of Sydney in the 1950s. All those quirky characters and all those great one liners. I cannot believe that this film never really gained the recognition it deserved.Its a must see!

    Quirky what-if flick about young Australian communist Joan Fraser Welch (Judy Davis), who gets impregnated by Joseph Stalin (F. Murray Abraham, who seriously does manage to look like the dictator) on the day that he dies, and has to raise the son without letting the boy know the whole story. "Children of the Revolution" gives one a sense of the sometimes tense situation down under in the '50s, which prompts Joan to go to the Soviet Union in the first place. But more than anything - in my opinion - it shows how, even though the USSR clearly betrayed its ideals, Joan maintains hers. She and her family never give up hope of a better future. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Geoffrey Rush, Richard Roxburgh and Sam Neill.

    This film is about a woman obsessed with Communism, and her life after bearing Stalin's child. The film is meant to be a comedy, and it should be viewed as so. Forget the political backdrop of it, and you will find it quite amusing. I find Judy Davis' performance as the obsessed woman very magnetic. She has this dedicated enthusiasm towards Communism, and she portrays it so well. Her despair towards the end of the film, when Communism experiences downfall, is also depicted well. Though it is a comedy, I find the pace rather slow, which is more like a drama. Overall, I think it is an intelligent comedy, much better than the average toilet joke films.

    I knew absolutely nothing about this film before I saw it and I don't think I had any an preconceptions. The story sounded oddly interesting--a woman who claimed her son was the bastard of Joseph Stalin! Well, despite the quirkiness of the premise, it just bored me immensely. It certainly wasn't funny nor was it particularly entertaining. I think part of the problem is that IF it originally was meant to be a comedy (and I'm not sure that really was the intention), how can Joseph Stalin be funny?! You would think that the fact that he was one of the greatest murderers in human history would preclude any attempt at comedy! If that WAS their intention, it was a very sick joke and may perhaps illustrate a problem with whoever was responsible for this film. Was this film, perhaps, meant less as a joke and more as a homage to Stalin or to paint him as not such a bad guy? Who knows. For that matter, who cares? All I know is you shouldn't waste your time. FYI--if you think I am being too narrow-minded or unfair to the picture, try substituting "Joseph Stalin" for Hitler, Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer as the focus of this movie. Do you think all their victims would find this movie a barrel of laughs?

    This film had so much promise. The basic idea of the plot, Stalin's love child trying to find himself, is incredibly funny and original. Some of the actors are great, in particular F. Murray Abraham, who does a wonderful job at Stalin. There are some really great, weird, darkly humorous parts to the film. This good part of the film especially centres around Stalin himself, in part since the whole idea of making a comedy about Stalin, a decidedly unfunny person, is itself hilarious and brilliant. However, the film mostly falls flat. It has many really boring parts which seem thrown in because the makers didn't know what else to do while the funniest themes are left underdeveloped, with a failure to fully use the great comic potential within the film. Other aspects are just plain lame or fail to come together and much of the film seems to just drag on, stumbling aimlessly onward, lost and without any idea of where it should be heading. The result gives the impression that the makers of this film realised that this was wonderful premise but then had no idea what to do with it.

    As a son who grew up in a family of communists, I found this movie very insightful: the twists and turns of what fervent idealists took to be worker's paradise through the 50s, 60s, 70s and then to the end of the dream in the late 80s/early 90s was very well portrayed, especially with Judy Davis' stalwart commitment, which was portrayed quite sympathetically; the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched, as were her son's struggles with history: both global and personal; all in all, a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic: a genre it's very easy to screw up and is rarely, if ever, handled as deftly as it was here.

    This film had so much promise. The basic idea of the plot, Stalin's love child trying to find himself, is incredibly funny and original. Some of the actors are great, in particular F. Murray Abraham, who does a wonderful job at Stalin. There are some really great, weird, darkly humorous parts to the film. This good part of the film especially centres around Stalin himself, in part since the whole idea of making a comedy about Stalin, a decidedly unfunny person, is itself hilarious and brilliant. However, the film mostly falls flat. It has many really boring parts which seem thrown in because the makers didn't know what else to do while the funniest themes are left underdeveloped, with a failure to fully use the great comic potential within the film. Other aspects are just plain lame or fail to come together and much of the film seems to just drag on, stumbling aimlessly onward, lost and without any idea of where it should be heading. The result gives the impression that the makers of this film realised that this was wonderful premise but then had no idea what to do with it.

    As a son who grew up in a family of communists, I found this movie very insightful: the twists and turns of what fervent idealists took to be worker's paradise through the 50s, 60s, 70s and then to the end of the dream in the late 80s/early 90s was very well portrayed, especially with Judy Davis' stalwart commitment, which was portrayed quite sympathetically; the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched, as were her son's struggles with history: both global and personal; all in all, a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic: a genre it's very easy to screw up and is rarely, if ever, handled as deftly as it was here.

    As many of the other reviews suggest, if you have ever been a lefty or if your parents were lefties you will enjoy this film. You really do need to have some familiarity with the vocabulary of socialism in the 1930s and 40s to fully appreciate how good this film is. The German film "Goodbye Lenin!" (2003) touches the same sort of themes. So, anyway, the script well written, literate and just a bit edgy, the way Australian films often are. The back story is wonderful and is ably developed by Sam Neil, Judy Davis and F. Murray Abraham. To my eye the cast has given a back story a wonderful 1940s or 50s feel. Sam Neil is good, as always, and remind me of James Mason. Judy Davis is good the way she is always good and reminded me of Betty Davis. F. Murray Abraham's performance actually reminded me of Claude Raines. This film works on many levels and Richard Roxborough and Rachel Griffiths are very good but I as am more familiar with Russian communist dogma and American films from the 40s and 50s, I am sure I missed a lot when the film turned its attention to contemporary Australian politics and the civil service. I loved the way the "International" was used in the sound tack. Of course it had to be there but I really liked the way it was used here.

    Some Australian movies are crap, but some are actually quite clever. This is one movie that I think is quite clever. It is about a fanatical communist woman who goes on a trip to Russia, sleeps with Stalin, and then returns to Australia and has his baby. It is not a drama but a comedy. This baby, Joseph, grows up to become the splitting image of his father and almost takes over Australia. The thing I find interesting is how Joseph takes over Australia. He is in prison for draft dodging and rescues some people from a fire. For his bravery he is given a full pardon, and with that he makes a speech in favour of giving prison guards better working conditions. With the support of the guards and the police, he is elected head of the police union and uses his control of the police to increase his power. The ending seems to be conclusive, but I think that there is more to it than not. Basically, fearing that her son may be killed, the Joseph's mother tells everybody that he is the son of Stalin. She is then assassinated by somebody that Joseph knew in prison. The connection is made and he is arrested. The problem with that is that with the newspapers printing that he is the son of Stalin is grounds for defamation, and in his position, he can manipulate the DNA tests and make it seem that he is not Stalin's son. Then there is the murder. The link is tenuous, and a guy that is as intelligent and as devious as Joseph will be able to beat the charge and return to his job, all the while eliminating his enemies. This movie is a comedy, and it starts off as one, but as the end nears the pace becomes much less comical and much more serious. The idea about how Joseph takes over Australia is a very plausible one. The creator of the movie obviously put a lot of thought into how it might be done. It is interesting to note how his life is very similar to that of Stalin's. He has a last name that should be changed (Hitler and Stalin), he is in prison for a short time as a political prisoner, and he works his way to the top through bureaucratic manipulation. Hitler and Stalin were both like that, though that is probably not the route of most dictators. Still, I thought that this was a great movie and like some of the ideas that are raised in it.

    A satire on personal authority

    Hello, I support the opinion, that "Children of the Revolution" is a drama film - however interwoven with absurd and impossible situations. These do not make a comedy, no more than the scene of Stalin perfuming his underpants. The choice of Stalin as the leading theme seems to be rather arbitrary. It is certainly not a film against left politics. We see the Vietnam antiwar demonstrations, and an Australian secret agent admitting that he is used to liquidate communist agitators. And the dictators Stalin, Beria and Chrutschov remarkably enthuse over American music. Actually the film seems mainly concerned with unconditional faith, human wickedness and relational collusions. The viewer is constantly reminded that things are not what they seem. In this respect the film strongly reminded me of "The Truman story" - but perhaps this association is purely personal. If any, the theme of the film may be a satire on personal authority (on the other hand, in "The Truman story" it is the immersion in the community, with in the end Truman sailing away to freedom and loneliness). I will now summarize the story, which seems allowed since the films lacks a climax or the building up of suspense. However, if you dislike being given away the clues stop reading now. Jane has been brainwashed into an ardent communist by her father, and for the rest of her life remains stuck into this pattern. She marries a man who is apparently attracted to strong women and without proper will. Her son Joe develops an uncanny desire for imprisonment, and gets married to the cop who repeatedly arrested him. During the story it remains unclear who is the real father of Joe. The suspicion that it might be Stalin completely changes Joes character and behavior. As a union leader Joe succeeds in taking over the power and control of the police force. And with the possession of the legitimated force, he gains control over the state. Eventually his mother brings about his fall after revealing to the public the name of his professed father (Stalin). Subsequently she is murdered by what seems to be an Australian fascist, and Joe is once again imprisoned. This final incident would signal that people are commonly held accountable for their parents deeds. I must admit that this unraveling puzzles me, since an obvious connection to the preceding events appears to be absent. This lack of coherence may be due to an unwise attempt to extend the film message, and thus a neglect of focus. It could be called a qualitative weakness of the film, but perhaps I am wrong and I welcome other explanations. Any way, basically the overall aim must have been to reveal the idiocy of unconditional authority, irrespective of its source, either family, communism, fascism or perhaps religion (with Jane as both the virgin mother and Judas). It rattles the belief in mans good nature, and urges to persevere in free and independent thought. Being a fan of realism, for me it was an interesting sidestep but not really my cup of tea. Sincerely yours, Emil Bakkum

    1996 Australian black comedy Children of the Revolution is one of those ideas that sounds better on paper than it plays on screen. It's the Cold War and Judy Davis is a hardline doctrinaire Communist oblivious to sad sack boyfriend Geoffrey Rush's attempts to win her hand because her heart belongs to Josef Stalin. When the dictator gets to see her letters - and more importantly her photo - he invites her to Moscow where a night of passion leaves him dead and her pregnant. Marrying Rush and raising the boy with her ideals (and a thing for getting arrested), he grows up to threaten a real revolution from within the system when he unionises both the Prison Service and the Police, but, as his mounting paranoia about his parentage as his office and his physique slowly merge into mirror images of Stalin, it's not quite the revolution she had in mind... Boasting a good cast and Richard Roxburgh, who is surprisingly adequate for a change, it never really catches fire. The tone is never quite right, leaving some of the best ideas high and dry while too many moments like Beria and Kruschev providing backing vocals for F. Murray Abraham's Stalin's rendition of I Get a Kick Out of You show the actors struggling with scenes that they all-too-clearly know just aren't working. Even Sam Neill occasionally seems unsure of how far to go or hold back as a treble agent of no particular loyalty who may or may not be young Joe's real father but certainly is the one who killed Joe's wife's parents (and their entire village) on Stalin's orders. On the plus side it does offer a role that perfectly suits Judy Davis' traditionally unsympathetic one-note anger for once, though it's Geoffrey Rush who impresses the most, managing to create a character who is both funny and believably human amid the stereotypes. Nice try, but no cigar.

    This film brought tears of joy and laughter to my family when we saw it. I guess you had to be there or you had to be the child of Australian lapsed communist actors in the 1950s to see how wickedly apt Judy Davis' performance was- Lines like "Its hard to plan a revolution with six o'clock closing" had us rolling on the floor. Loved it. Loved Richard Roxburgh. Loved all the cast and in particular loved the premise and the plot. Joe Stalin as the father of this almost physcotic love child. All the innocence of Sydney in the 1950s. All those quirky characters and all those great one liners. I cannot believe that this film never really gained the recognition it deserved.Its a must see!

    Quirky what-if flick about young Australian communist Joan Fraser Welch (Judy Davis), who gets impregnated by Joseph Stalin (F. Murray Abraham, who seriously does manage to look like the dictator) on the day that he dies, and has to raise the son without letting the boy know the whole story. "Children of the Revolution" gives one a sense of the sometimes tense situation down under in the '50s, which prompts Joan to go to the Soviet Union in the first place. But more than anything - in my opinion - it shows how, even though the USSR clearly betrayed its ideals, Joan maintains hers. She and her family never give up hope of a better future. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Geoffrey Rush, Richard Roxburgh and Sam Neill.

    This film is about a woman obsessed with Communism, and her life after bearing Stalin's child. The film is meant to be a comedy, and it should be viewed as so. Forget the political backdrop of it, and you will find it quite amusing. I find Judy Davis' performance as the obsessed woman very magnetic. She has this dedicated enthusiasm towards Communism, and she portrays it so well. Her despair towards the end of the film, when Communism experiences downfall, is also depicted well. Though it is a comedy, I find the pace rather slow, which is more like a drama. Overall, I think it is an intelligent comedy, much better than the average toilet joke films.

    I knew absolutely nothing about this film before I saw it and I don't think I had any an preconceptions. The story sounded oddly interesting--a woman who claimed her son was the bastard of Joseph Stalin! Well, despite the quirkiness of the premise, it just bored me immensely. It certainly wasn't funny nor was it particularly entertaining. I think part of the problem is that IF it originally was meant to be a comedy (and I'm not sure that really was the intention), how can Joseph Stalin be funny?! You would think that the fact that he was one of the greatest murderers in human history would preclude any attempt at comedy! If that WAS their intention, it was a very sick joke and may perhaps illustrate a problem with whoever was responsible for this film. Was this film, perhaps, meant less as a joke and more as a homage to Stalin or to paint him as not such a bad guy? Who knows. For that matter, who cares? All I know is you shouldn't waste your time. FYI--if you think I am being too narrow-minded or unfair to the picture, try substituting "Joseph Stalin" for Hitler, Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer as the focus of this movie. Do you think all their victims would find this movie a barrel of laughs?
