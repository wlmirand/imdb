  A group of eight college friends gather together at an island mansion belonging to heiress Muffy St. John to celebrate their final year of school. They soon discover that each has a hidden secret from their past which is revealed, and soon after, they turn up dead. Yet, are they really dead? Or is it just part of some very real and cruel April Fool's jokes? The hostess, Muffy, is the only one who apparently knows what's going on. But then again, is it really her doing the killing?

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road.

As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

(This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.)

    This movie doesn't get nearly enough credit. Had I not become a hardcore slasher junkie, I would never have even heard of it, but it's one of the smartest horror movies of all time. You see, now we take for granted that horror films are self-aware and break the fourth wall, and I give Wes Craven full credit for popularizing this trend, but 10 years before we all started discussing "the rules", this movie took those same rules and turned them on their head. Without giving away the ending, the film is simultaneously frightening and hilarious, and it does something that the Scream films could not do: It spoofs 1980's horror films WHILE BEING ONE OF THEM.

    Eight college friends gather on an isolated island mansion of an heiress schoolmate where a series of murders seems to break out related to hidden secrets being revealed by all of them. Is there really a killer on the loose, or is it just an elaborate practical joke? Aptly titled film seems to be made by people who have contempt for their audience, since this film(devoid of suspense or thrills) pulls the rug out from everyone, which may be seen as clever by some, put really renders the entire film pointless; though it is nicely filmed on location, viewer is unlikely going to appreciate being taken for a ride...

    I've seen many horror films in my life, from best (Halloween 1978) to worst (Psycho 1998), this movie is closer to the bad movies in the Slasher-Horror Genre. now at first it has a good concept, with the fact its on April fools day, but it does the clich&eacute; slashing kills throughout the film, and with the very wooden acting makes you really not care if the Teens Survive or not, and you think it would get better at the end , but no, it's Disappointing Ending, which NO ONE DIES makes me feel like i just wasted my money on this. which fortunately, was free on demand, this movie really made a cruel joke on me, if you enjoy slasher films, skip out on this flick.

    One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful. Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way. At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room. It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse. The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse. Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki. Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other. Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house. Chaz is next to be killed by having his penis chopped off. Nikki is attacked and apparently killed. Rob reveals that the sheriff said not to trust Muffy. Seeing the flare from the sheriff Rob and Kit try to gather the rest of the vacationers but find they are the only ones left. Kit and Rob find Nikki and Chaz... dead. They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run. Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute. They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit. Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded. I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.

    This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.

    Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out. The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now. Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance. From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.

This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.

    A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death... I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10

    Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.

    There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food & Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see. One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back. Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day." Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematographyall the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, orbeen spoiled by it. So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you. For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled. (This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.) The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and howdo you escape when there's no way off the island? Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue  even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending. On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other. I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT! *** Extreme Spoilers *** DO NOT CONTINUEif you have NOT seen this classic. After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie." He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.) At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse. Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!

    I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it. all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers. It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.
