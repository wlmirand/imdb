    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids.

Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent Gangster Film And An Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant.

OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible.

Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film.

If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion.

What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids.

Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent Gangster Film And An Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant.

OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.

    Even at an 8+ out of 10, this movie is extremely underrated. This is easily up there with the Godfather. Could even be ahead of it, but the jury's still out on that one. Everything about it is good. The acting is spectacular. The plot is captivating. Even the music is perfect. It is extremely thought provoking and has incredible depth to it, with just the right amount of subtlety. The end ties this together perfectly. It unfolds slowly, towards the end increasingly conveying a specific type of sadness I can not articulate no matter how hard I try. Extremely powerful. It leaves the viewer with more than any movie I have seen in my lifetime In this aspect, it beats Godfather easily. This is not a movie you can put on as background noise and loosely follow. You have to sit down and watch it, from beginning to end, probably more than once. The original, 4 hour long version, of course.

    Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous. That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping. This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying. For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana.

    The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time. Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it. I love the movie.

    Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece. Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal. Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather I and II,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible.

Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film.

If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion.

What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending. The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well. The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting. And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds. Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story. And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature. And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.

    This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film. The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men. Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life. One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular. The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

    Once Upon A Time In America is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story line,an incredibly well acted cast and great characters.The movie was on television the other night,so I decided to watch it,so IA looked it up on this,and it said its two hours and nineteen minutes long,the one I was watching was definitely much longer,it went on for at least more than three hours,it must have been a directors cut or something.Robert De Niro did a brilliant job as usual,and so did James Woods.This is my first time seeing James Woods in a proper role,I had only previously seen him in cameo roles and the many voice overs he has done,IO never realised he is actually a fantastic actor who knows exactly what he is doing. The story of David Aaronson (Robert De Niro) who returns to Manhatten thirty years later to confront his past.We learn what happened thirty years ago,the rise and fall of Davids mafia,and what brought him back.

    I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a "line up" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the "was the whole movie an opium dream ?" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.

    I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10. You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. I have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? While I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. Furthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. The only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. I realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.
