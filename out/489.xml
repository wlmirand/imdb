    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

    I've only seen a handful of Hitchcock's films, but the man's style continues to impress. And "Notorious" is just dripping with style, from the wardrobe, tone and camera angles and movement. Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn.

And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

    I've only seen a handful of Hitchcock's films, but the man's style continues to impress. And "Notorious" is just dripping with style, from the wardrobe, tone and camera angles and movement. Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

    I've only seen a handful of Hitchcock's films, but the man's style continues to impress. And "Notorious" is just dripping with style, from the wardrobe, tone and camera angles and movement. Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

    I've only seen a handful of Hitchcock's films, but the man's style continues to impress. And "Notorious" is just dripping with style, from the wardrobe, tone and camera angles and movement. Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.

    Yes, as the title says! The guy is amazing by doing just simply anything he does. If there's someone I knew that called him overrated or one of the worst, I would go out, bring an axe or a rifle, and kill that hater, because they might be insane or mentally ill not to like Hitchcock! And you know, one thing I have to say about this movie that's amazing is Ingrid Bergman. Even if she did a bad movie, she can already save it because she's Ingrid Bergman! She is amazing in anything she does, and she can already save a bad movie when she's there! Five stars from me already. Hitchcock being the director? Check. Three stars for that. Cary Grant? Check. One star. A good story? Check. One star. See why Hitchcock is just so awesome?! He can make anything good in a matter of seconds! And that's why he is one of the best directors in the world!

    Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A- Grade: 8.5/10

    Notorious ***1/2 (out of 4) 101 mins/U Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains Director: Alfred Hitchcock Plot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task. JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one. Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.

    I've only seen a handful of Hitchcock's films, but the man's style continues to impress. And "Notorious" is just dripping with style, from the wardrobe, tone and camera angles and movement. Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is &uuml;ber-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be. Had no idea where the story would go once Grant showed up to save the day, and it really says something that Hitchcock could make a slow descent on a staircase a real nail-biter. 8/10

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn. The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother. It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT. All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS. Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that). One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them. Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed. This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it.

    The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn.

This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal. The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to. NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination. I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible. Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

    There were other great Hitchcocks before this (Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt). But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.

    I never quite understood the fascination with Ingrid Bergman beyond her beauty, even after seeing Casablanca, but this film made me fall for her. Seeing Grant and her together made for a fantastic duo, and I loved seeing him help her down the stairs in the last scene, screw the consequences, he knew he had the upper hand! Rains was quite the convincing villain, yet I still found it hard to watch him walk back into the house to get what was coming to him. The camera-work was brilliant, from the close-ups on hands and keys to the crane coming down from the balcony to the action. Apparently producer Selznick and Hitchcock had much disagreements about the movie, but you can tell it is a Hitchcock through-and-through.

    This being the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen, I can honestly say I was impressed. However, upon watching a few of his other works, it wasn't my favorite. The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.

    Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her. Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event  the depletion of wine bottles at a party  and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.

    Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint. Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love? Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire. It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.
