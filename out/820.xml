    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle.

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.

The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle.

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.

The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.

    When i was a kid i used to watch it at least once a week.Now i'm a teenager and i still love it. This movie is simply fun and entertaining and clearly aimed for children; its just great to see all the cartoons' characters which you like in a movie . The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child.

    Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.

    Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996. Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation.

    Falling in the shadow of what preceded it and relying on its heightened USP to drive its shoddy narrative, Space Jam just abouts gets by on novelty and energy.

    It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball. Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just "heard of", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele  in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up. Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this "character's" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business. So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the "talents" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet. The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only "winner" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: "sports") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.

    This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.

    In case you don't know, the Looney Tunes cast is considered to be one the greatest cartoon characters since Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There's also Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of the 1990's. If you mix these two together you get.... ONE BIG STEAMING PILE OF PIG CRAP!!! Why do I think that this movie is a slam-dunk of epic failures you see on Youtube? Let's take a look. The first problem I have with this movie is that this is more like a very long commercial than a movie. It's suffering the same problem as Mac and Me, minus the fact that this movie is seven minutes shorter. The second problem, a literally BIG problem, is the camera angle. Are extreme close-ups supposed to be edgy or avant-garde? Every time we get a close-up on a certain character, I feel like every one of those characters wants to kiss me or make out with me. The third problem is the actors. Eight syllables: Michael Jordan is not funny! The Looney Tunes aren't funny either. They're like the synonym of the episode titles used in the MAD TV series: stupid, babyish, and highly forgettable. Is it really necessary to dumb down the Looney Tunes? Well, is it?!! And sadly, not even Bill Murray(Known for Ghostbusters), Wayne Knight(Of Seinfeld fame), and Lola Bunny(A new Looney Tunes character at the time) could save this movie from being horrifically bad. At least, this movie didn't bomb the box office(Unlike Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but there's no excuse in saving this movie from my rant! The movie felt like an 88-minute commercial, the camera angle gets too personal with all the characters in the movie, and not one of the actors(And the Looney Tunes, too) have put effort into making this movie funny.

    It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings. Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves "The Monstars" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as "Moron Mountain". The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best. Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist. Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.

    Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" has the right "Secret Stuff"

    As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's "Harlem Globetrotters" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team. "Space Jam" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with "Roger Rabbit", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ("I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars. SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some "Jordan's Secret Stuff", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the "Secret Stuff" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!). SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.

    Was surprised to see this great movie only had a 5.8. Some of the reviewers who said it was just a "fun" movie were right on the money. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.

    Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from "Space Jam." Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and "kidnap" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the "Monstars." Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group. The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality. Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.
