 <sinopse>
  A convicted rapist, released from prison after serving a 14 year sentence, stalks the family of the lawyer who originally defended him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Sam Bowden is a small-town corporate attorney/"Leave It to Beaver"-esque family-man. Max Cady is a tattooed, cigar-smoking, bible-quoting, psychotic rapist. What do they have in common? Fourteen years, ago Sam was a public defender assigned to Max Cady's rape trial, and he made a serious error: he hid a document from his illiterate client that could have gotten him acquitted. Now, the cagey, bibliophile Cady has been released, and he intends to teach Sam Bowden and his family a thing or two about loss.

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

    Cape Fear was an experience I was excited for: Martin Scorsese was taking his genius from mob movies and serious dramas and using it in a horror movie? Maybe it'd give horror flicks a more serious name? Maybe he'd be the one to break the barrier of the flat-lining genre in the early '90s. Well, Cape Fear examined all my hopes and did the exact opposite, causing an eruption of banality in Scorsese's followup to one of the best films of the '90s, Goodfellas. The score is chilling. From the moment the opening credits begin, the music punches you in the gut, and makes you scared in your seat. You wait for something really terrifying to happen, but the problem is, nothing worthy to that terrifying score ever surfaces. Robert DeNiro gives a good performance that scares the audience, but besides his decent character, everyone else seem flat and uninteresting. Jessica Lange's acting is noticeably bad. There are some moments where Scorsese really got me and was successful at making suspense, but those moments are scattered. Mostly it's filled with "Gotcha!" moments and the same horror clich&eacute;s, that we've seen a hundreds of times before, melt off the screen. But most of the time, especially in the finale, it feels like we're watching a B-List Monster movie, DeNiro's character not even possessing human qualities anymore, transforming into that metaphoric monster. Cape Fear creates an odd distance between itself and the audience. It had the potential to be a great movie, but keeps the viewer at arm's length, far away from any point of connection. Though it includes a couple of nice twists, it's an over-the-top, disappointing dud. I did really draw to the last line of the picture though, "When you live in the past, you die a little bit every day," it's the most moving moment of a picture that idolizes intense sexual scenes an an adult man and a minor. Rating: 4/10 Grade: C-

    - B+ This is a very good sequel, but not as good as the original. The film has a good villain, some good scenes, and doesn't t take away too much from the original without copying it. Having De Niro as the villain was a good choice as he displays a good, creepy stalker who will give some people the creeps. There are some good scenes with suspense in their like when Cady walks towards the trash, when Sam is outside of the boat and can't hear the family calling him, and the break in scene. You can see a resemblance in some scenes from the original and the film is not too different or take too much away while still being effective. What makes the original work better are that it is a much simpler story that works very effectively and this film is a little complex and the fast, jerky camera at times seems rather odd. Overall, a very good sequel. 4/5

    Sam Bowden and his family are so stupid that I already wished 30min into the movie that they would get slapped, killed or worse. He's utterly slow to understand that Max Cady (De Niro) is a danger to him and his family, even after one of his 'colleagues' gets raped and has her cheek bitten off. I mean, who can with an IQ above 80 pretend that nothing potentially dangerous is going on, after I encounter the same rapist at my house and everywhere else I go out. His family and more precisely is daughter is even slower to grasp the situation, although it is true that Sam doesn't reveal all the details. I feel more sympathy towards Max Cady than these morons.

    A remake of the original 60s film, Scorsese's Cape Fear is a psychological thriller about Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), a criminal lawyer stalked by Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a rapist he helped put behind bars fourteen years earlier. When unable to resolve the problem in the right way, Bowden is forced to take matters into his own hands. I've not see the original movie, so I'm not gonna try and make comparisons. Just taking it on it's own merit, I think Cape Fear is one of the best films Scorsese has made in his directorial career (and he's made some great films). It's not just the thriller aspect of the movie that he directs so well; Scorsese excels in his portrayal of the Bowden family unit, and how their disintegration plays into the film's events. Unlike Raging Bull, where the film is poetically shot, Scorsese goes for a much more abrupt and unflinching approach. It fits the mood of the film, and works well. Just like this might be Scorsese at his directorial best, I think this is also probably DeNiro at his acting best. Yes, there's The Godfather and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, who all have as much claim to that title, but I think his performance in this film is terrific. He does menacing beautifully well, and you can see a lot of Travis Bickle in him. Just watch the slow-burning scene between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis (also terrific as Nolte's daughter): it is a lesson in being sinister and, in my opinion, the best scene of the film. And let's not downplay just how good Nolte and Jessica Lange are. They are wonderful as the husband and wife in the middle of this chaos. My only gripe with the movie is that it is perhaps too abrupt at times: there are moments in the film, or certain sequences where I wanted to see more, for it to play out more, and it never always did. The music got on my nerves a bit, too. There seemed to be too much of it. The score is great, don't get me wrong, but it should have been used sparingly. Instead, we see that stereotypical thriller music almost every scene, and it got boring and annoying. I wanna see the original movie even more now, just because this was so good. Robert DeNiro has never looked better, in my opinion, and he's helped by a very strong script and, of course, the fantastic Martin Scorsese.

    Massively "pimped" and slightly overblown 90's remake of the semi-classic 60's thriller with the same name, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Gregory Peck and the phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Although not so much the case yet in the early 1990's, the term remake usually causes a lot of frustration and hatred among horror/cult fanatics, but this is of course an exception. With a man like Martin Scorsese in the director's chair and a cast full of superb names, you naturally don't have to fear that this will be a bland and uninspired re-telling of the same story solely intended to raise maximum profit with a minimum of cinematic effort. Scorsese's main contribution is that he pulled the image of the Bowden family severely through the blenderIn the 60's original the Bowdens were a picture-perfect model family, whereas here they are your average US citizens with vices and guilty of certain sins. Patriarch Sam flirts with adultery (and clearly has done before in the past), his wife Leigh is manic depressed and their rebelling teenage daughter Danielle even allows psychopaths to tingle her sexual curiosity! Their life already isn't much of a Sunday picnic even before Max Cady appears on their doorstep to extract sadistic revenge on Sam Bowden's family, as he was the defense attorney who deliberately withheld evidence that could have kept Cady out of jail fourteen years earlier. Robert De Niro gives his umpteenth extremely powerful performance as the terrifying, maniacal, deranged and bible-quoting scumbag Max Cady And yet, to me at least, the Cady character here isn't half as disturbing and appalling as Robert Mitchum portrayed him in 1962. Mitchum depicted the ultimately evil being of flesh and blood, while De Niro's Cady resembles more of a nearly indestructible and comic book like monstrosity. Like the case in the most dreadful teen slasher movies, Max Cady repeatedly pops back up after  supposedly  being beaten during the finale, which gives the film somewhat of a cheap popcorn entertainment touch. Many sequences in "Cape Fear", particularly the ones proving that the illiterate thug Max Cady turned into an intelligent and excessively eloquent criminal, are overlong and rather boring. Only two sequences truly qualify as genuinely nightmarish and horrifying, namely Cady's encounter with Sam's lewd mistress Lori and the confrontation between Cady and private eye Kersek inside the Bowden family mansion. The supportive cast is amazing, especially because Martin Scorsese presents the brilliant idea of casting the protagonists of the original movie in opposite roles. Good guy Gregory Peck appears as Max Cady's slimy new counselor and madman Robert Mitchum stars as the veteran police lieutenant advising Sam Bowden to seek specialist assistance. Technically and cinematographically speaking, "Cape Fear" is a superior movie, and inarguably one of the best thrillers of the overall disappointing 90's decade, but  unlike the original  not fundamental viewing as far as I'm concerned.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!

    Nick Nolte shredded some weight and dyed his hair black to play the mild mannered but having an affair attorney Sam. Who's marriage to Jessica Lange is on the rocks by having an affair. Robert De Niro put on weight of muscle to play ex-con and sexual rapist Max Cady as he goes after Nolte and his family. After Nolte's character did not want to represent him in the first place. Still, as Cady tries to get back at Sam. No matter what happens or occurs. Not even Sam hiring a PI or having three thugs beat up Cady as Cady gains the upper hand. Works in his favor. But after a murder happens, and Nolte and his family must flee but Cady is trying to stay one step right behind them no matter what. Very scary and really De Niro did a great and awesome job as the antagonist. While the usually tough guy Nolte, plays a torn family man.

    Everyone has fears. Fear is a part of life everybody must go through and sometimes it is difficult to overcome a fear. In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare. The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and/or replaced by better ones. Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten.

    Robert DeNiro replaces Robert Mitchum in the remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese. If the original can't be improved upon, there is no need for a second version. The outline is basically the same, with Max Cady(DeNiro) out of jail after eight years for rape. His lawyer, Sam(Nick Nolte, Gregory Peck in the original) gave little effort in his defense, and so the ex-con tracks down the attorney and his family and the bad times begin. Their dog is poisoned and Sam can't prove it. He hires thugs to beat up Max, but he injures them. He then hires a lawyer(Ironically Gregory Peck in a role reversal) to file charges against Sam. The other casting twist is having Mitchum play a police lieutenant this time, who fails to prove anything against Max. It all leads to an epic battle at Cape Fear, and Scorcese did nothing to improve on the already weak ending of the first film. Overall, not a bad movie, but I personally prefer Mitchum and Peck over DeNiro and Nolte.

    This is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever watched! It's full of twists, turns, and an incredible acting performances from the entire cast! Robert De Niro is creepy, crafty, and crazy as Max Cady. He made himself look like your best friend, and a great boyfriend... Until you go to bed with him! He tried his best to make Nick Nolte's life a living hell, and he succeeded! What made his lawyer even more scared was Max's victim was 16, and the lawyers daughter was 16! Julliet Lewis also put on a great performance playing a naive southern girl who fell for Max Cady's tricks! This movie was well done, and full of suspense after watching this Robert De Niro became my favorite actor!
