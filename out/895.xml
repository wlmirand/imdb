 <sinopse>
  Two years after the events of the first film, a new psychopath dons the "Ghost face" costume and a new string of murders begin.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It has been two years since the tragic events at Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks are trying to get on with their lives, and are currently both students at Windsor College. Cotton Weary is out of prison, and is trying to cash in on his unfortunate incarceration. Gale Weathers has written a bestseller, "The Woodsboro Murders," which has been turned into the film, "Stab," starring Tori Spelling as Sidney. As the film's play date approaches, the cycle of death begins anew. Dewey Riley immediately flies out of Woodsboro to try to protect Sidney, his "surrogate sister." But in this sequel to the 1996 horror film, the number of suspects only goes down as the body count slowly goes up!

    This is an excellent sequel as it has some of the same things as the first but with the traditional higher level of gore and new villains. With ghost face back, the first thing to figure out is which one is it. It was not hard to figure out as you had to think which of the ones that did not die, but there is a secret one you won't get. There is more violence but less amounts of gore used during each death and I still love Randy as the guide. There should be a book called Randy's Guide for Surviving a Horror Movie books 1,2, and 3. I did not care for some of the new guess and love stories of Gale and Dewey, but this film still connects to the life of Sydney Prescott, what is the connection this time?

    After re-writing my review for Scream I decided to do the rest with 2,3 and 4. Like I said for Scream that I think these films are fun but need to be talked about in better detail. The film Follows Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who her , Randy played by Jamie Kennedy, Her boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O'Connell, Gale played by Courtney Co and Dewey played by David Arquette are once again being terrorized by the Ghostface killer. Suspicions arise and Sidney is put more in danger than she was a year before. Spoilers! We find out that the killers are Mickey played by Timothy Olyphant and Mrs. Loomis Billy's Mother played by Laurie Metcalf. Like the last film Sidney kills them and moves on to a better life. This film is slightly better than the first with a better story, acting and a better climax than the first. Rated R For Language And Strong Bloody Violence. 2hrs/120min. 33 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments. This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury. This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.

    In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them. Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better. With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way. Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as "evil" as Billy did. Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original. Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

    After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage. A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    when i watched scream2 i did think that it wouldn't be better than the original but a good sequel. it didn't turn out to be as good as the first but that was expected. but if I'm honest this film really wasn't as good as people make it out to be. saying that the opening was good, but after that scream 2 started to go slowly down hill till the very end. the thing about this movie that really ticked me of is that they had so much pointless characters that i actually didn't care who was ghost face next victim. another thing that was boring about this movie is that it was so predictable from beginning to end i don't know why i wasted my time on this. i must say the killer was surprising but had a stupid reason for killing all his friends. the other killer i had to watch it many times to understand where she was coming from. overall I'm being nice giving scream 2 a 5 star. i don't recommend this to anyone that loves the original and is expecting a dam good sequel.but if you up for bit of a laugh and not expecting a good movie that meets the original then this is not the movie for you.

    I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com

When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com

    This is an excellent sequel as it has some of the same things as the first but with the traditional higher level of gore and new villains. With ghost face back, the first thing to figure out is which one is it. It was not hard to figure out as you had to think which of the ones that did not die, but there is a secret one you won't get. There is more violence but less amounts of gore used during each death and I still love Randy as the guide. There should be a book called Randy's Guide for Surviving a Horror Movie books 1,2, and 3. I did not care for some of the new guess and love stories of Gale and Dewey, but this film still connects to the life of Sydney Prescott, what is the connection this time?

    After re-writing my review for Scream I decided to do the rest with 2,3 and 4. Like I said for Scream that I think these films are fun but need to be talked about in better detail. The film Follows Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who her , Randy played by Jamie Kennedy, Her boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O'Connell, Gale played by Courtney Co and Dewey played by David Arquette are once again being terrorized by the Ghostface killer. Suspicions arise and Sidney is put more in danger than she was a year before. Spoilers! We find out that the killers are Mickey played by Timothy Olyphant and Mrs. Loomis Billy's Mother played by Laurie Metcalf. Like the last film Sidney kills them and moves on to a better life. This film is slightly better than the first with a better story, acting and a better climax than the first. Rated R For Language And Strong Bloody Violence. 2hrs/120min. 33 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments. This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury. This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.

    In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them. Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better. With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way. Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as "evil" as Billy did. Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original. Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

    After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage. A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    when i watched scream2 i did think that it wouldn't be better than the original but a good sequel. it didn't turn out to be as good as the first but that was expected. but if I'm honest this film really wasn't as good as people make it out to be. saying that the opening was good, but after that scream 2 started to go slowly down hill till the very end. the thing about this movie that really ticked me of is that they had so much pointless characters that i actually didn't care who was ghost face next victim. another thing that was boring about this movie is that it was so predictable from beginning to end i don't know why i wasted my time on this. i must say the killer was surprising but had a stupid reason for killing all his friends. the other killer i had to watch it many times to understand where she was coming from. overall I'm being nice giving scream 2 a 5 star. i don't recommend this to anyone that loves the original and is expecting a dam good sequel.but if you up for bit of a laugh and not expecting a good movie that meets the original then this is not the movie for you.

    I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch.

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com

    This is an excellent sequel as it has some of the same things as the first but with the traditional higher level of gore and new villains. With ghost face back, the first thing to figure out is which one is it. It was not hard to figure out as you had to think which of the ones that did not die, but there is a secret one you won't get. There is more violence but less amounts of gore used during each death and I still love Randy as the guide. There should be a book called Randy's Guide for Surviving a Horror Movie books 1,2, and 3. I did not care for some of the new guess and love stories of Gale and Dewey, but this film still connects to the life of Sydney Prescott, what is the connection this time?

    After re-writing my review for Scream I decided to do the rest with 2,3 and 4. Like I said for Scream that I think these films are fun but need to be talked about in better detail. The film Follows Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who her , Randy played by Jamie Kennedy, Her boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O'Connell, Gale played by Courtney Co and Dewey played by David Arquette are once again being terrorized by the Ghostface killer. Suspicions arise and Sidney is put more in danger than she was a year before. Spoilers! We find out that the killers are Mickey played by Timothy Olyphant and Mrs. Loomis Billy's Mother played by Laurie Metcalf. Like the last film Sidney kills them and moves on to a better life. This film is slightly better than the first with a better story, acting and a better climax than the first. Rated R For Language And Strong Bloody Violence. 2hrs/120min. 33 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments. This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury. This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.

    In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them. Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better. With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way. Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as "evil" as Billy did. Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original. Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

    After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage. A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    when i watched scream2 i did think that it wouldn't be better than the original but a good sequel. it didn't turn out to be as good as the first but that was expected. but if I'm honest this film really wasn't as good as people make it out to be. saying that the opening was good, but after that scream 2 started to go slowly down hill till the very end. the thing about this movie that really ticked me of is that they had so much pointless characters that i actually didn't care who was ghost face next victim. another thing that was boring about this movie is that it was so predictable from beginning to end i don't know why i wasted my time on this. i must say the killer was surprising but had a stupid reason for killing all his friends. the other killer i had to watch it many times to understand where she was coming from. overall I'm being nice giving scream 2 a 5 star. i don't recommend this to anyone that loves the original and is expecting a dam good sequel.but if you up for bit of a laugh and not expecting a good movie that meets the original then this is not the movie for you.

    I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com

    This is an excellent sequel as it has some of the same things as the first but with the traditional higher level of gore and new villains. With ghost face back, the first thing to figure out is which one is it. It was not hard to figure out as you had to think which of the ones that did not die, but there is a secret one you won't get. There is more violence but less amounts of gore used during each death and I still love Randy as the guide. There should be a book called Randy's Guide for Surviving a Horror Movie books 1,2, and 3. I did not care for some of the new guess and love stories of Gale and Dewey, but this film still connects to the life of Sydney Prescott, what is the connection this time?

    After re-writing my review for Scream I decided to do the rest with 2,3 and 4. Like I said for Scream that I think these films are fun but need to be talked about in better detail. The film Follows Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who her , Randy played by Jamie Kennedy, Her boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O'Connell, Gale played by Courtney Co and Dewey played by David Arquette are once again being terrorized by the Ghostface killer. Suspicions arise and Sidney is put more in danger than she was a year before. Spoilers! We find out that the killers are Mickey played by Timothy Olyphant and Mrs. Loomis Billy's Mother played by Laurie Metcalf. Like the last film Sidney kills them and moves on to a better life. This film is slightly better than the first with a better story, acting and a better climax than the first. Rated R For Language And Strong Bloody Violence. 2hrs/120min. 33 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments. This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury. This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.

    In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them. Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better. With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way. Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as "evil" as Billy did. Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original. Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

    After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage. A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    when i watched scream2 i did think that it wouldn't be better than the original but a good sequel. it didn't turn out to be as good as the first but that was expected. but if I'm honest this film really wasn't as good as people make it out to be. saying that the opening was good, but after that scream 2 started to go slowly down hill till the very end. the thing about this movie that really ticked me of is that they had so much pointless characters that i actually didn't care who was ghost face next victim. another thing that was boring about this movie is that it was so predictable from beginning to end i don't know why i wasted my time on this. i must say the killer was surprising but had a stupid reason for killing all his friends. the other killer i had to watch it many times to understand where she was coming from. overall I'm being nice giving scream 2 a 5 star. i don't recommend this to anyone that loves the original and is expecting a dam good sequel.but if you up for bit of a laugh and not expecting a good movie that meets the original then this is not the movie for you.

    I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com

    This is an excellent sequel as it has some of the same things as the first but with the traditional higher level of gore and new villains. With ghost face back, the first thing to figure out is which one is it. It was not hard to figure out as you had to think which of the ones that did not die, but there is a secret one you won't get. There is more violence but less amounts of gore used during each death and I still love Randy as the guide. There should be a book called Randy's Guide for Surviving a Horror Movie books 1,2, and 3. I did not care for some of the new guess and love stories of Gale and Dewey, but this film still connects to the life of Sydney Prescott, what is the connection this time?

    After re-writing my review for Scream I decided to do the rest with 2,3 and 4. Like I said for Scream that I think these films are fun but need to be talked about in better detail. The film Follows Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who her , Randy played by Jamie Kennedy, Her boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O'Connell, Gale played by Courtney Co and Dewey played by David Arquette are once again being terrorized by the Ghostface killer. Suspicions arise and Sidney is put more in danger than she was a year before. Spoilers! We find out that the killers are Mickey played by Timothy Olyphant and Mrs. Loomis Billy's Mother played by Laurie Metcalf. Like the last film Sidney kills them and moves on to a better life. This film is slightly better than the first with a better story, acting and a better climax than the first. Rated R For Language And Strong Bloody Violence. 2hrs/120min. 33 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments. This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury. This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.

    In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them. Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better. With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way. Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as "evil" as Billy did. Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original. Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

    After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage. A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    when i watched scream2 i did think that it wouldn't be better than the original but a good sequel. it didn't turn out to be as good as the first but that was expected. but if I'm honest this film really wasn't as good as people make it out to be. saying that the opening was good, but after that scream 2 started to go slowly down hill till the very end. the thing about this movie that really ticked me of is that they had so much pointless characters that i actually didn't care who was ghost face next victim. another thing that was boring about this movie is that it was so predictable from beginning to end i don't know why i wasted my time on this. i must say the killer was surprising but had a stupid reason for killing all his friends. the other killer i had to watch it many times to understand where she was coming from. overall I'm being nice giving scream 2 a 5 star. i don't recommend this to anyone that loves the original and is expecting a dam good sequel.but if you up for bit of a laugh and not expecting a good movie that meets the original then this is not the movie for you.

    I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.

    Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise. I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?

    'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie clich&eacute;'s and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

    I really don't have a lot to say about this one so I'm going to be very brief. I guess I need to explain the plot, of which there is none. After the release of a movie based on the events that took place in the first Scream, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with a copycat murderer on her college campus. She also has to deal with Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) getting in her way and the newly released from death row Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). This movie is beyond lazy. It straight up tells you that it's going to be a worse movie than the first, and as far as quality goes that's definitely true. This movie pulls the number one thing you cannot pull in a horror film which is to be utterly boring and slow-paced. There are very few kills and they are spaced out quite a bit. The people who get killed have even less emotion behind them than in the first movie so I never really care when any of them get it. Some people are only on screen long enough to explain why they exist in the movie before being killed and not fulfilling that existence. And again, my biggest problem with the first was that these movies do not know whether they want to be legitimate horror films or if they want to just make fun of horror films. At least in this one you have a lot less talk about movies, especially in the third act. There is a little bit more subtlety in some of the referencing and there's actually one scene that I genuinely liked, but mostly it's just a boring guy stabbing a couple people just like the first. That's really the biggest problem. I feel like the main point of the Scream movies is actually to take those clich&eacute;s and tropes that it's mentioning and make a better movie. It's smug and it's pretentious, and what's worse is that it fails on every level. It feeds into its own clich&eacute;s and becomes what it is making fun of. If that's the purpose then it's not something I want to see and if it's not the purpose then they are failing. It's basically a series of movies that tell you to go watch better movies. www.sploich.com
