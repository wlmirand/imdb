 <sinopse>
  An barbarian warrior becomes a king when he defeats a king in armed combat and the king's heir conspire to overthrow him and reclaim the throne by resurrecting an evil sorceress.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A barbarian named Kull unexpectedly becomes a king after an old king (whom Kull has just killed in a battle) gives his crown to him. But direct heirs of a killed king, trying to topple Kull and regain the throne, bring an old witch-queen Akivasha back to life. Their plan backfires, however, as Akivasha is going to allow their lords - demons - to rule the kingdom. The only thing that can stop her now is a breath of the god Volka.

    Around this time Kevin Sorbo was starring in the fashionably popular TV series "Hercules", so I guess it was only natural that he would go on to find himself starring in this sword-and-sorcery romp that's a cheesy, water-down version of "Conan the Barbarian" that felt like it was made for straight-to-TV. It uses the same world brought to us through the novels of author Robert E. Howard, as this was meant to be a Conan sequel; "Conan the Conqueror" but was changed to Kull for Sorbo when Schwarzenegger turned down the role. Kull a lowly born barbarian inherits the throne of Valusia and becomes a real favourite of the people. However the king's sons believe the throne to be theirs and conjure up an ancient spirit of darkness to rid Kull of their kingdom. However she has plans of her own. There's some mindless fun abound and Sorbo makes for a comfortable heroine, but it somewhat plods along and is fairly unimaginative with it being limited in most aspects. Namely its use of bland visual effects. Although we do get to see Sorbo smack lips with a hideous rubber looking demon. Then throw in the beautiful ladies Karina Lombard and Tia Carrere in her seductively villainous role. Thomas Ian Griffith plays it mean and Sven-Ole Thorsen chews up the scenery in the small part he has as the king Kull inherits the kingdom from. Sorbo actually brings a considerately articulate nature to his part. Stagy sets, cheap costumes and mechanical direction. It knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more, but it just lacks energy despite barbarian smashing, corny dialogues and howling guitar score. "My whole life has been a quest."

    This movie has enough dumbness, that it either is really bad, or that bad that it turns good. Fortunately the dumbness is a fun warrant. There is even this feeling the actors knew how cheesy this whole thing is, and played along with it, which makes it more fun. They have Kevin Sorbo in that movie, who is perfect for charikaturs of honorable heroes in the ages of swords and dragons. The chicks are awesomely how. Overall a 5/10, for the undeniable mind-hurt of stupidity and fun. The chicks, hmm, o.k. a 6/10

    Well, I thought you'd have to motor in order to come up with anything cheesier than Arnie's 3 sword and sorcery outings (2 Conans and a Red Sonja), but Kevin Sorbo's Kull the Conqueror manages to do so with a minimum of trouble. To be fair, the sets and costumes are OK, and the cast give it their all. But the special effects are a bit naff, and the special effects make-up is super-naff. And the script, plot, and characterisations are not only naff, but also cheesy (and when I say cheesy, I'm talking Gorgonzola). It passes the time if you're not feeling fussy.

    Being a huge Robert E Howard fan, Kull the Conqueror isn't quite the literary version of the character, but all in all, it's nice seeing Robert E. Howard getting some screen time! (Conan fans, yes even Arnold's Conan barely resembles the literary version so relax a little). This movie is nowhere near as bad a some make it out to be. Kevin Sorbo, fresh from TVs Hercules fame, does a good job as the title character. The movie plays more like lite fantasy than epic fantasy, but still has some awesome moments. For some reason I love the scene at the end when Kull destroys the stone wall with the old laws written on it with his Axe. I've seen the movie probably a dozen times and it doesn't get old. Karina Lombard is gorgeous as Kull's love interest, and Tia Carrere does a fine job as the villainess. (Ironically, the Conan movie with Jason Mamoa (2011) uses the same villainess and a similar plot of resurrecting her.) Thomas Ian Griffith as Taligaro also does a good job as Kull's warrior nemesis. He should get more roles! Rounding out the cast with Litefoot as a priest of Valka and brother of the love interest, and you have a quest plot that resembles something like Jason and the Argonauts. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the action and the humor of Kull the Conqueror! "By this Axe I rule!"

    Back in the 1990s, there was a syndicated TV show called "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys". It starred Kevin Sorbo as the demi-god and followed the light hearted adventures of the son of Zeus as he and various companions wandered through the world of ancient myth, punching evil in the face. The shows blend of action, humor and moral earnestness was so popular it spawned a companion series called "Xena: Warrior Princess". Unfortunately, it also shaped this sub-mediocre entry into the sword-n-sorcery genre. Kull is another creation of Robert E. Howard, the mind behind Conan the Barbarian. Kull is also a barbarian, but one who lands on the throne of the kingdom of Valusia. In Howard's short stories, Kull must defend his land from external enemies and his crown from treasonous nobles. This movie has only the barest of those details in common with Howard's writing, and I'm not sure why they bothered. Kull the Conqueror has very little to do with the spirit or substance of Robert E. Howard. It's basically a more generic and inferior version of Conan the Destroyer, which was itself a huge step down from the original Conan the Barbarian. The first half of the film deals with Kull's (Kevin Sorbo) ascension to the throne and the plotting nobles led by General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith). Kull meets a beautiful fortune teller (Katrina Lombard) and the nobles enlist the help of a wizard (Edward Tudor-Pole) to resurrect an ancient demon queen (Tia Carrera). His enemies seemingly kill Kull, but then he turns up fine and teams up with the fortune teller and her priestly brother (Litefoot) as the story becomes the exact same sort of quest we've seen a jillion times before in these films. The first thing to know about Kull the Conqueror is that is has a cringingly bad hair metal soundtrack. The overblown guitar riffs here make the soundtrack of Ladyhawke seem like the greatest music ever made. The second thing to know about this movie is that all the action and comedy are virtually identical in tone to "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", except dumber and without much of a moral center. That vacuousness joins hands with a grating sense of modernity in everything the characters do and say to create a doubly anachronistic feeling. This thing comes off like a lame 80s action movie playing dress up. The third thing to know is that Sorbo gives the best performance by far with an indifferent version of the same exact stuff he did as Hercules. All I can say about Kull the Conqueror is that it won't make your eyes bleed. There's nothing here that could even be charitably described as "good", but you won't feel like you completely wasted your time if you watch it.

    On the scale of sword and sorcery flicks, this ranks below 'Conan The Barbarian', above the dreary 'Red Sonja', about on par with 'Conan The Destroyer'; which is to say that it's an energetic fantasy film that doesn't take itself seriously and can be a lot of fun if you let it be. Kull of Atlantis seeks to join the army of Velusia, but instead, through an unexpected turn of events, he finds himself proclaimed king of the empire instead. Holding onto his new throne will be much harder than taking it, as the blood heirs to the empire make a deal with a wizard to revive a 3000 year-old demon who seeks to kill King Kull and claim the empire for herself. 'Kull the Conqueror' originally started out as 'Conan the Conqueror', but after Arnold refused to reprise the role, the script was changed to accommodate Howard's other barbarian hero, Kull. As such, much of the story is actually taken from the Conan stories ('The Hour of the Dragon' in particular). Interestingly, the first Conan movie took most of it's story material from the Kull tales. A little bit of irony for you. As for the film itself, it does enough things right to entertain; Sorbo fits Kull role perfectly (actually truer to the source character than Arnold ever was), Griffith is an effectively grim villain and Tia Carrere hams it up nicely as the evil Akiavasia. The locations and sets have a wonderfully fantasy feel to them and the assorted fight scenes are well choreographed and fast paced. Given their age, the FX and make are good without ever looking terribly real. One thing I found very enjoyable in the film was the liberal dose of humor; not lame one-liners or goofy antics, but some solid humor that compliments the scenes rather than ruining them. The biggest problem the movie has is the damn PG-13 rating; it keeps the movie from really delving into adult fantasy the way you want it too. Both 'Red Sonja' and 'Conan the Destroyer' suffered the same problem. Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. It makes a decent entry in the Howard film canon (the best way to watch it is part 4 of a Howard marathon; Conan 1 & 2, Red Sonja, Kull). The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon. Energetic, humorous, and full of action (though not without some issues), a solid sword and sorcery flick. 7/10

    Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. "Kull" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo. It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes "Conan the Destroyer" look like "Lord of the Rings." It makes "Red Sonja" look like "Jason and the Argonauts." And it makes "Conan the Barbarian" look like "Citizen Kane." I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down. There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie. It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame "Merlin" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new "Solomon Kane" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.

    I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film. It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.

    First the good news. This picture has production design worthy of Conan creator Robert E. Howard's legacy. Everything else is bad news. The script is allegedly a many version hand-me-down re-working of the never made third Conan movie, the film in which Conan would finally win the throne of Aquilonia. Instead we get Howard's backup hero (Kull) who takes the throne at the beginning of the film in an un-stirring, non-epic little battle and then loses it quickly to Witch Demon Akivasha (played to the hilt by Tia Carrere who obviously had rare fun as a bad girl). Kull then kills an hour on a very routine quest-to-find-his-right-to-rule and finally returns for the classic Howard showdown between good brawn and evil sorcery. The main problem is Kevin Sorbo, who got so good at playing Hercules in self-spoofing post-modern fashion that he simply doesn't resonate with the necessary authentic bronze age thuggishness of a Howard hero. Here was a chance to play a variation on his usual screen self and he punted it. Too bad. The set decorators captured the proper essence of Robert Howard...

Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. It makes a decent entry in the Howard film canon (the best way to watch it is part 4 of a Howard marathon; Conan 1 & 2, Red Sonja, Kull). The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon. Energetic, humorous, and full of action (though not without some issues), a solid sword and sorcery flick. 7/10

    Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. "Kull" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo. It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes "Conan the Destroyer" look like "Lord of the Rings." It makes "Red Sonja" look like "Jason and the Argonauts." And it makes "Conan the Barbarian" look like "Citizen Kane." I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down. There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie. It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame "Merlin" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new "Solomon Kane" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.

    I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film. It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.

    First the good news. This picture has production design worthy of Conan creator Robert E. Howard's legacy. Everything else is bad news. The script is allegedly a many version hand-me-down re-working of the never made third Conan movie, the film in which Conan would finally win the throne of Aquilonia. Instead we get Howard's backup hero (Kull) who takes the throne at the beginning of the film in an un-stirring, non-epic little battle and then loses it quickly to Witch Demon Akivasha (played to the hilt by Tia Carrere who obviously had rare fun as a bad girl). Kull then kills an hour on a very routine quest-to-find-his-right-to-rule and finally returns for the classic Howard showdown between good brawn and evil sorcery. The main problem is Kevin Sorbo, who got so good at playing Hercules in self-spoofing post-modern fashion that he simply doesn't resonate with the necessary authentic bronze age thuggishness of a Howard hero. Here was a chance to play a variation on his usual screen self and he punted it. Too bad. The set decorators captured the proper essence of Robert Howard...

    Around this time Kevin Sorbo was starring in the fashionably popular TV series "Hercules", so I guess it was only natural that he would go on to find himself starring in this sword-and-sorcery romp that's a cheesy, water-down version of "Conan the Barbarian" that felt like it was made for straight-to-TV. It uses the same world brought to us through the novels of author Robert E. Howard, as this was meant to be a Conan sequel; "Conan the Conqueror" but was changed to Kull for Sorbo when Schwarzenegger turned down the role. Kull a lowly born barbarian inherits the throne of Valusia and becomes a real favourite of the people. However the king's sons believe the throne to be theirs and conjure up an ancient spirit of darkness to rid Kull of their kingdom. However she has plans of her own. There's some mindless fun abound and Sorbo makes for a comfortable heroine, but it somewhat plods along and is fairly unimaginative with it being limited in most aspects. Namely its use of bland visual effects. Although we do get to see Sorbo smack lips with a hideous rubber looking demon. Then throw in the beautiful ladies Karina Lombard and Tia Carrere in her seductively villainous role. Thomas Ian Griffith plays it mean and Sven-Ole Thorsen chews up the scenery in the small part he has as the king Kull inherits the kingdom from. Sorbo actually brings a considerately articulate nature to his part. Stagy sets, cheap costumes and mechanical direction. It knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more, but it just lacks energy despite barbarian smashing, corny dialogues and howling guitar score. "My whole life has been a quest."

    This movie has enough dumbness, that it either is really bad, or that bad that it turns good. Fortunately the dumbness is a fun warrant. There is even this feeling the actors knew how cheesy this whole thing is, and played along with it, which makes it more fun. They have Kevin Sorbo in that movie, who is perfect for charikaturs of honorable heroes in the ages of swords and dragons. The chicks are awesomely how. Overall a 5/10, for the undeniable mind-hurt of stupidity and fun. The chicks, hmm, o.k. a 6/10

    Well, I thought you'd have to motor in order to come up with anything cheesier than Arnie's 3 sword and sorcery outings (2 Conans and a Red Sonja), but Kevin Sorbo's Kull the Conqueror manages to do so with a minimum of trouble. To be fair, the sets and costumes are OK, and the cast give it their all. But the special effects are a bit naff, and the special effects make-up is super-naff. And the script, plot, and characterisations are not only naff, but also cheesy (and when I say cheesy, I'm talking Gorgonzola). It passes the time if you're not feeling fussy.

    Being a huge Robert E Howard fan, Kull the Conqueror isn't quite the literary version of the character, but all in all, it's nice seeing Robert E. Howard getting some screen time! (Conan fans, yes even Arnold's Conan barely resembles the literary version so relax a little). This movie is nowhere near as bad a some make it out to be. Kevin Sorbo, fresh from TVs Hercules fame, does a good job as the title character. The movie plays more like lite fantasy than epic fantasy, but still has some awesome moments. For some reason I love the scene at the end when Kull destroys the stone wall with the old laws written on it with his Axe. I've seen the movie probably a dozen times and it doesn't get old. Karina Lombard is gorgeous as Kull's love interest, and Tia Carrere does a fine job as the villainess. (Ironically, the Conan movie with Jason Mamoa (2011) uses the same villainess and a similar plot of resurrecting her.) Thomas Ian Griffith as Taligaro also does a good job as Kull's warrior nemesis. He should get more roles! Rounding out the cast with Litefoot as a priest of Valka and brother of the love interest, and you have a quest plot that resembles something like Jason and the Argonauts. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the action and the humor of Kull the Conqueror! "By this Axe I rule!"

    Back in the 1990s, there was a syndicated TV show called "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys". It starred Kevin Sorbo as the demi-god and followed the light hearted adventures of the son of Zeus as he and various companions wandered through the world of ancient myth, punching evil in the face. The shows blend of action, humor and moral earnestness was so popular it spawned a companion series called "Xena: Warrior Princess". Unfortunately, it also shaped this sub-mediocre entry into the sword-n-sorcery genre. Kull is another creation of Robert E. Howard, the mind behind Conan the Barbarian. Kull is also a barbarian, but one who lands on the throne of the kingdom of Valusia. In Howard's short stories, Kull must defend his land from external enemies and his crown from treasonous nobles. This movie has only the barest of those details in common with Howard's writing, and I'm not sure why they bothered. Kull the Conqueror has very little to do with the spirit or substance of Robert E. Howard. It's basically a more generic and inferior version of Conan the Destroyer, which was itself a huge step down from the original Conan the Barbarian. The first half of the film deals with Kull's (Kevin Sorbo) ascension to the throne and the plotting nobles led by General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith). Kull meets a beautiful fortune teller (Katrina Lombard) and the nobles enlist the help of a wizard (Edward Tudor-Pole) to resurrect an ancient demon queen (Tia Carrera). His enemies seemingly kill Kull, but then he turns up fine and teams up with the fortune teller and her priestly brother (Litefoot) as the story becomes the exact same sort of quest we've seen a jillion times before in these films. The first thing to know about Kull the Conqueror is that is has a cringingly bad hair metal soundtrack. The overblown guitar riffs here make the soundtrack of Ladyhawke seem like the greatest music ever made. The second thing to know about this movie is that all the action and comedy are virtually identical in tone to "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", except dumber and without much of a moral center. That vacuousness joins hands with a grating sense of modernity in everything the characters do and say to create a doubly anachronistic feeling. This thing comes off like a lame 80s action movie playing dress up. The third thing to know is that Sorbo gives the best performance by far with an indifferent version of the same exact stuff he did as Hercules. All I can say about Kull the Conqueror is that it won't make your eyes bleed. There's nothing here that could even be charitably described as "good", but you won't feel like you completely wasted your time if you watch it.

    On the scale of sword and sorcery flicks, this ranks below 'Conan The Barbarian', above the dreary 'Red Sonja', about on par with 'Conan The Destroyer'; which is to say that it's an energetic fantasy film that doesn't take itself seriously and can be a lot of fun if you let it be. Kull of Atlantis seeks to join the army of Velusia, but instead, through an unexpected turn of events, he finds himself proclaimed king of the empire instead. Holding onto his new throne will be much harder than taking it, as the blood heirs to the empire make a deal with a wizard to revive a 3000 year-old demon who seeks to kill King Kull and claim the empire for herself. 'Kull the Conqueror' originally started out as 'Conan the Conqueror', but after Arnold refused to reprise the role, the script was changed to accommodate Howard's other barbarian hero, Kull. As such, much of the story is actually taken from the Conan stories ('The Hour of the Dragon' in particular). Interestingly, the first Conan movie took most of it's story material from the Kull tales. A little bit of irony for you. As for the film itself, it does enough things right to entertain; Sorbo fits Kull role perfectly (actually truer to the source character than Arnold ever was), Griffith is an effectively grim villain and Tia Carrere hams it up nicely as the evil Akiavasia. The locations and sets have a wonderfully fantasy feel to them and the assorted fight scenes are well choreographed and fast paced. Given their age, the FX and make are good without ever looking terribly real. One thing I found very enjoyable in the film was the liberal dose of humor; not lame one-liners or goofy antics, but some solid humor that compliments the scenes rather than ruining them. The biggest problem the movie has is the damn PG-13 rating; it keeps the movie from really delving into adult fantasy the way you want it too. Both 'Red Sonja' and 'Conan the Destroyer' suffered the same problem. Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed.

The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon.

    Being a huge Robert E Howard fan, Kull the Conqueror isn't quite the literary version of the character, but all in all, it's nice seeing Robert E. Howard getting some screen time! (Conan fans, yes even Arnold's Conan barely resembles the literary version so relax a little). This movie is nowhere near as bad a some make it out to be. Kevin Sorbo, fresh from TVs Hercules fame, does a good job as the title character. The movie plays more like lite fantasy than epic fantasy, but still has some awesome moments. For some reason I love the scene at the end when Kull destroys the stone wall with the old laws written on it with his Axe. I've seen the movie probably a dozen times and it doesn't get old. Karina Lombard is gorgeous as Kull's love interest, and Tia Carrere does a fine job as the villainess. (Ironically, the Conan movie with Jason Mamoa (2011) uses the same villainess and a similar plot of resurrecting her.) Thomas Ian Griffith as Taligaro also does a good job as Kull's warrior nemesis. He should get more roles! Rounding out the cast with Litefoot as a priest of Valka and brother of the love interest, and you have a quest plot that resembles something like Jason and the Argonauts. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the action and the humor of Kull the Conqueror! "By this Axe I rule!"

    Back in the 1990s, there was a syndicated TV show called "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys". It starred Kevin Sorbo as the demi-god and followed the light hearted adventures of the son of Zeus as he and various companions wandered through the world of ancient myth, punching evil in the face. The shows blend of action, humor and moral earnestness was so popular it spawned a companion series called "Xena: Warrior Princess". Unfortunately, it also shaped this sub-mediocre entry into the sword-n-sorcery genre. Kull is another creation of Robert E. Howard, the mind behind Conan the Barbarian. Kull is also a barbarian, but one who lands on the throne of the kingdom of Valusia. In Howard's short stories, Kull must defend his land from external enemies and his crown from treasonous nobles. This movie has only the barest of those details in common with Howard's writing, and I'm not sure why they bothered. Kull the Conqueror has very little to do with the spirit or substance of Robert E. Howard. It's basically a more generic and inferior version of Conan the Destroyer, which was itself a huge step down from the original Conan the Barbarian. The first half of the film deals with Kull's (Kevin Sorbo) ascension to the throne and the plotting nobles led by General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith). Kull meets a beautiful fortune teller (Katrina Lombard) and the nobles enlist the help of a wizard (Edward Tudor-Pole) to resurrect an ancient demon queen (Tia Carrera). His enemies seemingly kill Kull, but then he turns up fine and teams up with the fortune teller and her priestly brother (Litefoot) as the story becomes the exact same sort of quest we've seen a jillion times before in these films. The first thing to know about Kull the Conqueror is that is has a cringingly bad hair metal soundtrack. The overblown guitar riffs here make the soundtrack of Ladyhawke seem like the greatest music ever made. The second thing to know about this movie is that all the action and comedy are virtually identical in tone to "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", except dumber and without much of a moral center. That vacuousness joins hands with a grating sense of modernity in everything the characters do and say to create a doubly anachronistic feeling. This thing comes off like a lame 80s action movie playing dress up. The third thing to know is that Sorbo gives the best performance by far with an indifferent version of the same exact stuff he did as Hercules. All I can say about Kull the Conqueror is that it won't make your eyes bleed. There's nothing here that could even be charitably described as "good", but you won't feel like you completely wasted your time if you watch it.

    On the scale of sword and sorcery flicks, this ranks below 'Conan The Barbarian', above the dreary 'Red Sonja', about on par with 'Conan The Destroyer'; which is to say that it's an energetic fantasy film that doesn't take itself seriously and can be a lot of fun if you let it be. Kull of Atlantis seeks to join the army of Velusia, but instead, through an unexpected turn of events, he finds himself proclaimed king of the empire instead. Holding onto his new throne will be much harder than taking it, as the blood heirs to the empire make a deal with a wizard to revive a 3000 year-old demon who seeks to kill King Kull and claim the empire for herself. 'Kull the Conqueror' originally started out as 'Conan the Conqueror', but after Arnold refused to reprise the role, the script was changed to accommodate Howard's other barbarian hero, Kull. As such, much of the story is actually taken from the Conan stories ('The Hour of the Dragon' in particular). Interestingly, the first Conan movie took most of it's story material from the Kull tales. A little bit of irony for you. As for the film itself, it does enough things right to entertain; Sorbo fits Kull role perfectly (actually truer to the source character than Arnold ever was), Griffith is an effectively grim villain and Tia Carrere hams it up nicely as the evil Akiavasia. The locations and sets have a wonderfully fantasy feel to them and the assorted fight scenes are well choreographed and fast paced. Given their age, the FX and make are good without ever looking terribly real. One thing I found very enjoyable in the film was the liberal dose of humor; not lame one-liners or goofy antics, but some solid humor that compliments the scenes rather than ruining them. The biggest problem the movie has is the damn PG-13 rating; it keeps the movie from really delving into adult fantasy the way you want it too. Both 'Red Sonja' and 'Conan the Destroyer' suffered the same problem. Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. It makes a decent entry in the Howard film canon (the best way to watch it is part 4 of a Howard marathon; Conan 1 & 2, Red Sonja, Kull). The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon. Energetic, humorous, and full of action (though not without some issues), a solid sword and sorcery flick. 7/10

    Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. "Kull" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo. It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes "Conan the Destroyer" look like "Lord of the Rings." It makes "Red Sonja" look like "Jason and the Argonauts." And it makes "Conan the Barbarian" look like "Citizen Kane." I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down. There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie. It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame "Merlin" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new "Solomon Kane" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.

    I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film. It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.

    First the good news. This picture has production design worthy of Conan creator Robert E. Howard's legacy. Everything else is bad news. The script is allegedly a many version hand-me-down re-working of the never made third Conan movie, the film in which Conan would finally win the throne of Aquilonia. Instead we get Howard's backup hero (Kull) who takes the throne at the beginning of the film in an un-stirring, non-epic little battle and then loses it quickly to Witch Demon Akivasha (played to the hilt by Tia Carrere who obviously had rare fun as a bad girl). Kull then kills an hour on a very routine quest-to-find-his-right-to-rule and finally returns for the classic Howard showdown between good brawn and evil sorcery. The main problem is Kevin Sorbo, who got so good at playing Hercules in self-spoofing post-modern fashion that he simply doesn't resonate with the necessary authentic bronze age thuggishness of a Howard hero. Here was a chance to play a variation on his usual screen self and he punted it. Too bad. The set decorators captured the proper essence of Robert Howard...

    i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.

    Around this time Kevin Sorbo was starring in the fashionably popular TV series "Hercules", so I guess it was only natural that he would go on to find himself starring in this sword-and-sorcery romp that's a cheesy, water-down version of "Conan the Barbarian" that felt like it was made for straight-to-TV. It uses the same world brought to us through the novels of author Robert E. Howard, as this was meant to be a Conan sequel; "Conan the Conqueror" but was changed to Kull for Sorbo when Schwarzenegger turned down the role. Kull a lowly born barbarian inherits the throne of Valusia and becomes a real favourite of the people. However the king's sons believe the throne to be theirs and conjure up an ancient spirit of darkness to rid Kull of their kingdom. However she has plans of her own. There's some mindless fun abound and Sorbo makes for a comfortable heroine, but it somewhat plods along and is fairly unimaginative with it being limited in most aspects. Namely its use of bland visual effects. Although we do get to see Sorbo smack lips with a hideous rubber looking demon. Then throw in the beautiful ladies Karina Lombard and Tia Carrere in her seductively villainous role. Thomas Ian Griffith plays it mean and Sven-Ole Thorsen chews up the scenery in the small part he has as the king Kull inherits the kingdom from. Sorbo actually brings a considerately articulate nature to his part. Stagy sets, cheap costumes and mechanical direction. It knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more, but it just lacks energy despite barbarian smashing, corny dialogues and howling guitar score. "My whole life has been a quest."

    This movie has enough dumbness, that it either is really bad, or that bad that it turns good. Fortunately the dumbness is a fun warrant. There is even this feeling the actors knew how cheesy this whole thing is, and played along with it, which makes it more fun. They have Kevin Sorbo in that movie, who is perfect for charikaturs of honorable heroes in the ages of swords and dragons. The chicks are awesomely how. Overall a 5/10, for the undeniable mind-hurt of stupidity and fun. The chicks, hmm, o.k. a 6/10

    Well, I thought you'd have to motor in order to come up with anything cheesier than Arnie's 3 sword and sorcery outings (2 Conans and a Red Sonja), but Kevin Sorbo's Kull the Conqueror manages to do so with a minimum of trouble. To be fair, the sets and costumes are OK, and the cast give it their all. But the special effects are a bit naff, and the special effects make-up is super-naff. And the script, plot, and characterisations are not only naff, but also cheesy (and when I say cheesy, I'm talking Gorgonzola). It passes the time if you're not feeling fussy.

    First the good news. This picture has production design worthy of Conan creator Robert E. Howard's legacy. Everything else is bad news. The script is allegedly a many version hand-me-down re-working of the never made third Conan movie, the film in which Conan would finally win the throne of Aquilonia. Instead we get Howard's backup hero (Kull) who takes the throne at the beginning of the film in an un-stirring, non-epic little battle and then loses it quickly to Witch Demon Akivasha (played to the hilt by Tia Carrere who obviously had rare fun as a bad girl). Kull then kills an hour on a very routine quest-to-find-his-right-to-rule and finally returns for the classic Howard showdown between good brawn and evil sorcery. The main problem is Kevin Sorbo, who got so good at playing Hercules in self-spoofing post-modern fashion that he simply doesn't resonate with the necessary authentic bronze age thuggishness of a Howard hero. Here was a chance to play a variation on his usual screen self and he punted it. Too bad. The set decorators captured the proper essence of Robert Howard...

    i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.

    Around this time Kevin Sorbo was starring in the fashionably popular TV series "Hercules", so I guess it was only natural that he would go on to find himself starring in this sword-and-sorcery romp that's a cheesy, water-down version of "Conan the Barbarian" that felt like it was made for straight-to-TV. It uses the same world brought to us through the novels of author Robert E. Howard, as this was meant to be a Conan sequel; "Conan the Conqueror" but was changed to Kull for Sorbo when Schwarzenegger turned down the role. Kull a lowly born barbarian inherits the throne of Valusia and becomes a real favourite of the people. However the king's sons believe the throne to be theirs and conjure up an ancient spirit of darkness to rid Kull of their kingdom. However she has plans of her own. There's some mindless fun abound and Sorbo makes for a comfortable heroine, but it somewhat plods along and is fairly unimaginative with it being limited in most aspects. Namely its use of bland visual effects. Although we do get to see Sorbo smack lips with a hideous rubber looking demon. Then throw in the beautiful ladies Karina Lombard and Tia Carrere in her seductively villainous role. Thomas Ian Griffith plays it mean and Sven-Ole Thorsen chews up the scenery in the small part he has as the king Kull inherits the kingdom from. Sorbo actually brings a considerately articulate nature to his part. Stagy sets, cheap costumes and mechanical direction. It knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more, but it just lacks energy despite barbarian smashing, corny dialogues and howling guitar score. "My whole life has been a quest."

    This movie has enough dumbness, that it either is really bad, or that bad that it turns good. Fortunately the dumbness is a fun warrant. There is even this feeling the actors knew how cheesy this whole thing is, and played along with it, which makes it more fun. They have Kevin Sorbo in that movie, who is perfect for charikaturs of honorable heroes in the ages of swords and dragons. The chicks are awesomely how. Overall a 5/10, for the undeniable mind-hurt of stupidity and fun. The chicks, hmm, o.k. a 6/10

    Well, I thought you'd have to motor in order to come up with anything cheesier than Arnie's 3 sword and sorcery outings (2 Conans and a Red Sonja), but Kevin Sorbo's Kull the Conqueror manages to do so with a minimum of trouble. To be fair, the sets and costumes are OK, and the cast give it their all. But the special effects are a bit naff, and the special effects make-up is super-naff. And the script, plot, and characterisations are not only naff, but also cheesy (and when I say cheesy, I'm talking Gorgonzola). It passes the time if you're not feeling fussy.

    Being a huge Robert E Howard fan, Kull the Conqueror isn't quite the literary version of the character, but all in all, it's nice seeing Robert E. Howard getting some screen time! (Conan fans, yes even Arnold's Conan barely resembles the literary version so relax a little). This movie is nowhere near as bad a some make it out to be. Kevin Sorbo, fresh from TVs Hercules fame, does a good job as the title character. The movie plays more like lite fantasy than epic fantasy, but still has some awesome moments. For some reason I love the scene at the end when Kull destroys the stone wall with the old laws written on it with his Axe. I've seen the movie probably a dozen times and it doesn't get old. Karina Lombard is gorgeous as Kull's love interest, and Tia Carrere does a fine job as the villainess. (Ironically, the Conan movie with Jason Mamoa (2011) uses the same villainess and a similar plot of resurrecting her.) Thomas Ian Griffith as Taligaro also does a good job as Kull's warrior nemesis. He should get more roles! Rounding out the cast with Litefoot as a priest of Valka and brother of the love interest, and you have a quest plot that resembles something like Jason and the Argonauts. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the action and the humor of Kull the Conqueror! "By this Axe I rule!"

    Back in the 1990s, there was a syndicated TV show called "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys". It starred Kevin Sorbo as the demi-god and followed the light hearted adventures of the son of Zeus as he and various companions wandered through the world of ancient myth, punching evil in the face. The shows blend of action, humor and moral earnestness was so popular it spawned a companion series called "Xena: Warrior Princess". Unfortunately, it also shaped this sub-mediocre entry into the sword-n-sorcery genre. Kull is another creation of Robert E. Howard, the mind behind Conan the Barbarian. Kull is also a barbarian, but one who lands on the throne of the kingdom of Valusia. In Howard's short stories, Kull must defend his land from external enemies and his crown from treasonous nobles. This movie has only the barest of those details in common with Howard's writing, and I'm not sure why they bothered. Kull the Conqueror has very little to do with the spirit or substance of Robert E. Howard. It's basically a more generic and inferior version of Conan the Destroyer, which was itself a huge step down from the original Conan the Barbarian. The first half of the film deals with Kull's (Kevin Sorbo) ascension to the throne and the plotting nobles led by General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith). Kull meets a beautiful fortune teller (Katrina Lombard) and the nobles enlist the help of a wizard (Edward Tudor-Pole) to resurrect an ancient demon queen (Tia Carrera). His enemies seemingly kill Kull, but then he turns up fine and teams up with the fortune teller and her priestly brother (Litefoot) as the story becomes the exact same sort of quest we've seen a jillion times before in these films. The first thing to know about Kull the Conqueror is that is has a cringingly bad hair metal soundtrack. The overblown guitar riffs here make the soundtrack of Ladyhawke seem like the greatest music ever made. The second thing to know about this movie is that all the action and comedy are virtually identical in tone to "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", except dumber and without much of a moral center. That vacuousness joins hands with a grating sense of modernity in everything the characters do and say to create a doubly anachronistic feeling. This thing comes off like a lame 80s action movie playing dress up. The third thing to know is that Sorbo gives the best performance by far with an indifferent version of the same exact stuff he did as Hercules. All I can say about Kull the Conqueror is that it won't make your eyes bleed. There's nothing here that could even be charitably described as "good", but you won't feel like you completely wasted your time if you watch it.

    On the scale of sword and sorcery flicks, this ranks below 'Conan The Barbarian', above the dreary 'Red Sonja', about on par with 'Conan The Destroyer'; which is to say that it's an energetic fantasy film that doesn't take itself seriously and can be a lot of fun if you let it be. Kull of Atlantis seeks to join the army of Velusia, but instead, through an unexpected turn of events, he finds himself proclaimed king of the empire instead. Holding onto his new throne will be much harder than taking it, as the blood heirs to the empire make a deal with a wizard to revive a 3000 year-old demon who seeks to kill King Kull and claim the empire for herself. 'Kull the Conqueror' originally started out as 'Conan the Conqueror', but after Arnold refused to reprise the role, the script was changed to accommodate Howard's other barbarian hero, Kull. As such, much of the story is actually taken from the Conan stories ('The Hour of the Dragon' in particular). Interestingly, the first Conan movie took most of it's story material from the Kull tales. A little bit of irony for you. As for the film itself, it does enough things right to entertain; Sorbo fits Kull role perfectly (actually truer to the source character than Arnold ever was), Griffith is an effectively grim villain and Tia Carrere hams it up nicely as the evil Akiavasia. The locations and sets have a wonderfully fantasy feel to them and the assorted fight scenes are well choreographed and fast paced. Given their age, the FX and make are good without ever looking terribly real. One thing I found very enjoyable in the film was the liberal dose of humor; not lame one-liners or goofy antics, but some solid humor that compliments the scenes rather than ruining them. The biggest problem the movie has is the damn PG-13 rating; it keeps the movie from really delving into adult fantasy the way you want it too. Both 'Red Sonja' and 'Conan the Destroyer' suffered the same problem. Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. It makes a decent entry in the Howard film canon (the best way to watch it is part 4 of a Howard marathon; Conan 1 & 2, Red Sonja, Kull). The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon. Energetic, humorous, and full of action (though not without some issues), a solid sword and sorcery flick. 7/10

    Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. "Kull" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo. It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes "Conan the Destroyer" look like "Lord of the Rings." It makes "Red Sonja" look like "Jason and the Argonauts." And it makes "Conan the Barbarian" look like "Citizen Kane." I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down. There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie. It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame "Merlin" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new "Solomon Kane" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.

    I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film. It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.

Another issue is the generic butt-rock music that accompanies the fight scenes; the music for the rest of the film is epic and fits the period nature of the film, but the lame guitar riffs that get churned out during every fight is just annoying. Also, many of the supporting actors just aren't any damn good at acting and tend to injure many of the scenes. Lastly, the script is a little lean for an epic adventure film, clocking in at just 90 minutes, almost no time is spent getting to know the characters any better than is necessary to drive the plot. All told, this is a fun, fast, fantasy film meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. It makes a decent entry in the Howard film canon (the best way to watch it is part 4 of a Howard marathon; Conan 1 & 2, Red Sonja, Kull). The film made no money in theaters, which is too bad, as we aren't likely to see any more of these any time soon. Energetic, humorous, and full of action (though not without some issues), a solid sword and sorcery flick. 7/10

    Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves. "Kull" is exactly that film, and it's more fun to laugh at its unintentional idiocy than to make any attempt to take it seriously as fantasy. At any rate the film-makers also took care of that possibility by filling the sorry affair with so much contemporary humor in a pathetic attempt to imitate the formula of the "Hercules" TV show that starred the same "actor" who appears in this film, Kevin Sorbo. It didn't have to be this way. King Kull is one of the more interesting characters created by the legendary 1930s pulp writer Robert E. Howard, famous for Conan. Howard's writing has been mostly insulted and degraded by these film versions -- but this one is so awful it makes "Conan the Destroyer" look like "Lord of the Rings." It makes "Red Sonja" look like "Jason and the Argonauts." And it makes "Conan the Barbarian" look like "Citizen Kane." I actually paid to see this in the theater because I'm such a big Robert Howard fan. It was so disappointing that I had to give it a spin on DVD just to see if it could really be as bad as I remembered it. It's far worse than any memory can convey. Right away, you have probably the worst music I've ever heard in a film, a combination of mock-Wagner and mock-Megadeth. Electric guitars on the soundtrack are an especially poor harbinger for a film supposedly set in ancient history. Then you start to notice that all the characters look like roadies for Spinal Tap, and the main villain dude has a mullet that would make Billy Ray Cyrus jealous. So maybe it all makes sense in a twisted way... apparently this was a demographic they were shooting for; perhaps they even advertised this film on WWF smack-down. There's no getting around what limits the movie the most -- basically the entire cast is wrong and incompetent. Kevin Sorbo always seems like a nice guy, and little else. He's all wrong to play a sadistic barbarian, but the film-makers have solved that problem by removing all traces of Kull's personality and all signs that he was created by Robert Howard, or you could say all signs that he was created by anyone other than a market research survey group. He's polite, soft-spoken, respectful of women, and he wants to free all the slaves. He's a hero -- a character who has no business in a Robert Howard story. Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor. Doing that to his world and his characters is like making a Disney movie about the Donner Party. I can understand why a lot of people look down on writing like his, because they assume it's actually junk like this movie. It doesn't stop there, but I get too tired of thinking about it to go on. Sorbo is the least of our worries in the cast actually, considering that Harvey Fierstein is painfully hammy (and his character seems modeled on a dull character from the TV show), and the director seems to have thought it was a good idea to give all the heavy acting scenes to Tia Carrere. Her misbegotten performance lends the movie most of its laugh factor. This movie is cheap and ugly looking -- I would guess that they spent more money on the lame "Merlin" miniseries in the 90s than they did on this movie which was foisted on theater audiences. Not only that, but the director has no taste and no talent for cinema at all. Everything is shot in a bland and generic way so that none of it seems infused with any kind of power or majesty. Whatever the faults of Milius' original Conan film, and there are many, at the very least he attempted to get the dark atmosphere of Howard's world right and to convey some fraction of the characters' fatalism. Unless the new "Solomon Kane" film is a huge surprise, it will be the only example of somebody even attempting something different of this type in a fantasy movie for a long time.

    I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity. Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film. It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this.

    First the good news. This picture has production design worthy of Conan creator Robert E. Howard's legacy. Everything else is bad news. The script is allegedly a many version hand-me-down re-working of the never made third Conan movie, the film in which Conan would finally win the throne of Aquilonia. Instead we get Howard's backup hero (Kull) who takes the throne at the beginning of the film in an un-stirring, non-epic little battle and then loses it quickly to Witch Demon Akivasha (played to the hilt by Tia Carrere who obviously had rare fun as a bad girl). Kull then kills an hour on a very routine quest-to-find-his-right-to-rule and finally returns for the classic Howard showdown between good brawn and evil sorcery. The main problem is Kevin Sorbo, who got so good at playing Hercules in self-spoofing post-modern fashion that he simply doesn't resonate with the necessary authentic bronze age thuggishness of a Howard hero. Here was a chance to play a variation on his usual screen self and he punted it. Too bad. The set decorators captured the proper essence of Robert Howard...

    i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.
