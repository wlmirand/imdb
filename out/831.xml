  Snake Plissken is once again called in by the United States government to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The year is 2013 and Snake Plissken is back but this time it's L.A., which through the agency of earthquakes has become an island of the damned. But something has gone wrong in this new moral order, because the President's daughter has absconded to L.A. with a detonation device, and Snake is commandeered to retrieve it. But just below the surface there is a coiled Snake ready to strike.

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything.

Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure.

Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke.

Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him.

    Director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell return for this belated sequel set in the "future" year 2013(!) that has Snake Plissken, now 16 years older, but tough as ever, as he is forced to undertake another mission for his government, this time(in a similar manner from the first)he must rescue the president's(Cliff Robertson, in a sympathetic performance, ironically enough!) rogue daughter, who has gone into hiding in Earthquake ravaged L.A. with a doomsday device that a local revolutionary wants. Snake must retrieve her and it, or be killed by the poison said to be in his bloodstream. Entertaining sequel isn't quite as stylish as the first, but still has good action and satiric touches to compensate. Kurt Russell is still quite game, and has a crucial role at film's end to determine if humanity will move forward, or be sent back technologically. What will he do? Watch and find out!

    It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that... Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today. He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack. In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day. But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on. Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)

    The movie is almost a remake of "Escape from New York (1981)". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after "Terminator 2". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of "Terminator 2", which was the most expensive movie at the time. Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like: - "Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!" - "Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later) - "This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once" The "instructors" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget??? Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.

    In the year 2013, the city of Los Angeles has been separated from the country by a series of earthquakes, and like New York, has transformed into a corrupted prison. The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device..... Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original. And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie. But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times. Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more. Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm. If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this. I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.

    Escape from L.A. (1996) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Carpenter and Kurt Russell bring Snake Plissken back for this sequel to ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film takes place in 2013 as Los Angeles is the new prison for the worst people in America. The government asks Plissken to go into L.A. and get a device that controls a major weapon that could destroy the world. ESCAPE FROM L.A. was a major bomb when it was originally released and this here was the first time I've watched it since opening night. I think the film has improved somewhat but it's still a major disappointment considering how terrific the original movie is. The most shocking thing is that writers Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill didn't bother coming up with a better story. This here is pretty much just a remake of the original movie and it's a shame there weren't any newer, more original things going on here. One major problem with the screenplay is that it appears the three writers were just coming up with "fun" scenes and this entire film just has good scenes that never really fit together or add up to anything interesting. You have Peter Fonda playing a hippie surfer. There's Pam Grier as a fighter who used to be a man. Steve Buscemi plays a talent agent. Bruce Campbell plays a surgeon who likes to cut out eyeballs. Cliff Robertson plays the President and Stacy Keach is his main soldier. All of these people are fun actors but their roles here really aren't all that fun. We get an over-the-top surfing scene that just never works and there's quite a bit of CGI that looks really bad today. So, what keeps the film from really falling apart? I'd say it's Russell who manages to be good in the film even though he's not given as much to do here. I think the one-liners aren't as sharp and the screenplay really lets the character down. Still, Russell has no problem fitting back into the role, which he has called the favorite of his career. The rest of the cast are fun to watch even if they're not given much to do. Carpenter adds in some good looking visuals but sadly in the end it really doesn't add up to much. One really wishes that a third film would have come along to try and fix the mistakes of this one but as it stands this here isn't horrible but it's certainly a disappointment.

    'Escape from New York' is a cult classic but a sequel doesn't come any close. Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

    Escape from L.A is an old school (i mean that 80's school) action flick, reuniting Carpenter and Russell on his personal favorite role as SNAKE PLISSKEN, and what's good about this sequel is that it stays true to the first's (Escape From N.Y) formula, thanks to master Carpenter's dark vision. These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the "two" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... - And the best thing that could happen from these "action-saga" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.

    I wondered why Carpenter hasn't made a movie since "Ghost of Mars" until recently with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But this movie was beginning to show what seems like Carpenter's "fatigue" or with the demand for more special FX laced films like "ID4" or "Mission:Impossible", Carpenter saw the writing on the wall and didn't adapt well. He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked "...like cartoons." Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said "Print" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around "The Road Warrior" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A. For the outdated and lackluster CGI compared to the other CGI heavy flicks of '96. Watch ID4 and you'll definitely see how well the CGI has stood the test of time compared to this...sequel.

    Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure. I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clich&eacute;s with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence. Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast. John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down). In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for "the duke" to re-appear or "Brain." But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and "Snake" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the " I am going to kill you, when I get back line?" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was "Escapr from L.A" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title
