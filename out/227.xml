 <sinopse>
  On the eve of retirement, Kirk and McCoy are charged with assassinating the Klingon High Chancellor and imprisoned. The Enterprise crew must help them escape to thwart a conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the last best hope for peace.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After an explosion on their moon, the Klingons have an estimated 50 years before their ozone layer is completely depleted, and they all die. They have only one choice - to make peace with the Federation, which will mean an end to 70 years of conflict. Captain James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their "experience" with the Klingon race. Peace talks don't quite go to plan, and eventually Kirk and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination, and sent to Rura Penthe, a snowy hard-labor prison camp. Will they manage to escape? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons?

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about.

Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    I may fall in with the seeming majority opinion that Star Trek II is the best of the series, but even if so, this one is its equal in my estimation. Which is to say, it is not just a good Star Trek or science fiction film, but a wonderful film, period. Certainly it is not a coincidence that Nicholas Meyer directed both II and VI. The story is stirringly poignant as both an allegorical take on the end of the Cold War, and as a glimpse into the minds of characters. There is a complexity to it all, not just the overall plot, but the dialog in each scene, that is a joy to experience as a viewer. The screenplay is terrific, and that, combined with the excellent cinematography, allows the actors to turn in great, dramatic performances. The cast of guest stars is also very strong. There are moments of humor, but they do not cheapen the story; rather they adding a perfect touch of humanity. The special effects are excellent. To me, the color palette of the entire film fits the tone as this is the end of an era. The bright, warm colors of the television series and early film installments gives way to a darker, more sober look, most obvious in the interior of the new-er Enterprise, and also throughout other elements of the production design. The ending scenes comprise a deeply moving send-off to an age of Star Trek. Captain Kirk precedes his final log entry by invoking the line from Peter Pan, "second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning". Star Trek has gone some interesting places since this, but it has never been so cinematic in its sweep, or as inspiring in its message.

    Although this fifth sequel has knowing humour, excellent visual effects and a few moments of intrigue, it's let down by a rather plodding and uninvolving mystery. When the Enterprise apparently attacks a Klingon ship and members of the crew beam aboard to assassinate the chancellor, Kirk and McCoy are tried and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives on Hoth...er, sorry, an ice prison planet. But who was really responsible? Well, it's not all that interesting despite the usual fun banter between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. The script has moments of banality and poor jokes while most of the regular cast demonstrate why we never see them outside of 'Star Trek' films. The score by Cliff Eidelman isn't his best but lifts the otherwise disappointing material. The sign off is kind of sweet, though.

    Star Trek 6: The Undiscoverd Country is a great movie and a very pleasing finale for the original Star Trek crew.It's not better than Wrath Of Khan or the Voyage Home in my opinion but it's still a very good farewell to Kirk,Spock and the rest of the crew.It is certainly a huge improvement from the previous movie,the Final Frontier,I went into this movie with a negative attitude after watching that one,but I was very pleased,it had a great storyline that was developed very well and the always great cast are as good as ever in this adventure,and I got a bit upset during the final scene,it was a brilliant farewell.Fans of Star Trek will be very pleased with this final farewell to the original Star Trek crew. The Klingon Empire sue for peace,but the Enterprise is accused of an act of war against them,it's up to Spock to prove Kirk's innocence.

    A Fitting and Emotional Tribute To The Best Star Trek Crew

    Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country ***1/2 (out of 4) 113 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Kim Cattrall, Mark Lenard, Kurtwood Smith, Brock Peters, Christopher Plummer Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: After Kirk and McCoy are wrongfully charged with killing the Klingon Chancellor, The Enterprise Crew search into a political conspiracy against an act of peace throughout The Federation. JJ's Verdict: In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Nicholas Meyer has created a memorable and fitting tribute to the Original Enterprise crew. His direction and writing make this film and he has certainly created the best entry in the series for these characters. The film starts off with Captain Sulu, not of the Enterprise but the Excelsior. This opening is collision-packed and it is great for George Takei to have his moment to shine in. In fact, this film really just shows off every crew-member's brilliance and they all get their moments to shine. We then find out that there is a peace summit that Kirk has to escort the Klingons to. While on this journey, the Klingons and humans have a dinner on The Enterprise that excels in being completely awkward. The film gives you a sense of admiration from both parties but a certain reluctancy to extend it into nothing more than a conversation with many many awkward silences. The Enterprise then starts attacking the Klingon ship without firing anything and this all-then results in the death of the Klingon Chancellor and the arrest and charge of Kirk and McCoy for the murder. The trial scene in which they are interrogated is extremely tense and frightening in a strange sort of way. This then sets up a brilliant Agatha Christie style investigation into who actually killed the chancellor and how the shots were fired from the Enterprise. My only complaint about the film itself is that it is way too obvious who the mole is and when the crew discover who it is, the film tries to make it a massive thing. In terms of comparison to the previous instalment, everything is better. The script is witty and the one-liners actually work. We actually get a real sense of threat here and the series best space battle that isn't too far off the quality of Star Wars (although the effects still need working on). The acting is much improved and Leonard Nimoy shows here why Spock should be human and knowledgeable in every film as Nimoy's presence on screen is superb. Christopher Plummer makes a great nemesis to Kirk and really makes you despise his character. The ending itself is truly emotional as these characters leave our screens for the last time. Although Doohan, Shatner and Koenig would return for Generations, The Undiscovered Country is the perfect finale for the beloved crew of the Enterprise. Just before his emotional final voice-over, Kirk tells Chekov to navigate to the 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning' . And I, for one, certainly wish I was joining him. Rating: 4/5

    I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (although not so much of the movies). After seeing this particular movie twice, it didn't get any better the second time around. The movie was Star Trek for its own sake. It was bloated, too filled with itself, the last gasp of an aging franchise. The original actors had all become old, really old. This movie lacked the freshness and vigour of TOS. It didn't make this long-time fan rejoice in the original series; it made me feel sad about what had become of it. It made no sense that all of them (minus Sulu) were still aboard the same ship (although I suppose they had a story line -- something half-assed and bogus -- to explain that). They tried too hard to recreate TOS. There must have been fascinating, original, age-appropriate things they could have done with the aging cast of this series -- but this certainly wasn't it. A quiet movie exploring the later lives of these space explorers (perhaps mixed with an intelligent sci-fi story) would have been more appropriate here. They should have called in a great science fiction writer to do this one. This movie reveals a basic exploration v. action tension that is also affecting Abrams's recent Star Trek movies. The almighty dollar is forcing filmmakers to make action movies; however, that's not what Star Trek is all about. The magical moments of the original series had nothing to do with the bridge of the Enterprise, spaceships, phaser shootouts, etc. Star Trek was primarily about ideas.

    After the grandiose nonsense of "Star Trek V", there was some doubt whether it was worth assembling the old crew for another film. But luckily, they've saved the best 'til last. All great sci-fi is an allegory that has some resonance with viewers but rarely is this adhered to these days. But this film, with its wobbly cameras and pretty hokey tongue-in-cheek acting, actually delivers a film that not only serves as a great way to say goodbye to the cast but also provides a thrilling and exciting sci-fi blaster that is the best in the series featuring the old codgers. After a catastrophic explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, the Klingon Empire has no choice but to seek peace with the Federation in order to avoid extinction. As the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) heads for peace talks, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Chancellor safely across Federation territory. But after a frosty reception aboard the Enterprise, Gorkon's ship is attacked by the Enterprise - to the surprise of everyone on board. Fearing the incident could cause an escalation in tensions, Kirk and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) are arrested and charged with the Chancellor's assassination. But Spock (Leonard Nimoy) remains determined to uncover the real culprits but time is running out - the peace talks are still threatened by the assassins and the Enterprise becomes the chief target of General Chang (Christopher Plummer)... Whether the effects at the time had actually caught up with the imagination of creator Gene Roddenberry or not, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is the first and last Trek film with the original cast that actually nails it. The wibbly-wobbly effects of the Sixties has been replaced by decent visuals as starships blast each other to kingdom come and Klingon blood floats across the screen in zero-gravity. The plot is also first-class - not only does it give all the cast something to do (meaning that Scotty (James Doohan) is more than comic relief for once) but is a sweeping epic invoking memories of the fall of Communism and the US's history of racial segregation as well as a fairly decent murder mystery. Aside from the original cast, performances are pretty good too - Plummer is clearly enjoying himself beneath the make-up and Kim Cattrall surprises as Spock's apprentice Valeris. As for the TV crew, Shatner (always the weakest link) seems to realise that this will be his last chance to ham it up on the big screen and boy, does he go for it! But even he cannot take anything away from a film that is surprisingly good, perhaps more than anyone really expected. By far and away the best cinematic outing of the original crew, "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" is a good film regardless of your feelings about the TV show. It's almost a shame that this was the final curtain call (the next film, "Star Trek: Generations" was simply handing the baton over to the Next Gen crew) but in a way, it's pleasing that they could produce a winning film when they tried. There always seemed to be something getting in the way, usually a story that failed to convince like travelling back in time to the Eighties or Kirk literally meeting God. This is simple and plausible within the Star Trek universe, meaning that you can follow the film without turning into a complete nerd. This is not just enjoyable, thrilling and intelligently written but the best thing about this film is how much of a surprise this is - a Star Trek movie that you actually want to see. A fantastic way for the old crew to sign off but frustrating that they couldn't do movies like this sooner.

    This was a good movie to what could be said as the final Star Trek film before the next generation. It was not a film I remembered much about it except that it was good. It's a little sad to it end, but after the Final Frontier, they thought things may be heading in the wrong direction. After all this time, the cast has still left the same mark on me as they are a memorable group of fun actors having a good time with these movies and the bonding that has occurred over time. The effects are fun to watch and the script just as enjoyable. This is truly one of the most memorable movie series ever as the Enterprise signs off for its last time.

    Star Trek Into Darkness is honestly, my most anticipated film of the year and in order to get a better understanding of this franchise, I realized now would be the most appropriate time to watch each and every film of the franchise, for the first time! The first five films of the original crew series have been fantastic- or should I say four (exclude the horrible first film) and realizing this is the last film with the original crew, it really disappoints me. However, did I like the film I have come to love all the films of this series, apart from the first. The characters are likable and the story is generally good. There have been some real characterization moments and some great moments and fantastic comedic lines! Thankfully, this film still delivers everything great about a Star Trek film, and for me, the best film after Wrath of Khan Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to negotiate with a Klingon High Chancellor concerning his safety as Praxis is due to be destroyed in a matter of 50 years. A few incidents take place, resulting in the Klingon Chancellor's death as Kirk and Bones are accused and put under trial, resulting in them being put into exile on a frozen planet by the name of Rura Penthe. The remaining crew of the Enterprise must uncover the mystery of the attacker and rescue their old friends before they freeze to death! The thing with this film is that it most certainly feels like a Star Trek movie, more than the previous two instalments, which despite liking, didn't feel as Trekkie as this does! Nicolas Meyer returns to direct this film and what better way than to conclude the first part of this franchise. There were moments when the special effects did look ridiculous and other times where it looked decent but considering the SFX have been really poor throughout the franchise, that cannot be considered an issue. This film clearly illustrates that story over special effects is what matters and people likeI don't knowGEORGE LUCAScould have learnt from this! Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the second best instalment of the franchise and a fantastic way for our original crew to bow out of this franchise. A truly entertaining film with quite some character development sequences and a few great thrills make this a truly fantastic film

    After 25 years of success, the Star Trek franchise released its sixth feature film, once again uniting the original cast of the series with director Nicholas Meyer. This is the final film with the original Enterprise crew, and it remains one of the best. The film literally starts off with a bang; the explosion of Praxis is still one of the most awe-inspiring special effects I have seen, showcasing a pair of giant subspace shockwaves ripping across space. The film immediately delves into moody, dramatic political tension, before the shockingly violent events that hurl the Enterprise crew into a frantic struggle to rescue their own members and discover the truth. It all culminates to a thrilling climax. A few bits of quirky humor, and an endearing farewell, round off what must be the darkest and most intense Trek movie of the lot. The story for this is an interesting one: it mirrors the Cold War in many ways, but also incorporates Shakespearean lines (as seen in the film's title) to dig up strong themes of the future. Fear and uncertainty of the future drive the villains through the treachery, which contrasts heavily with the Enterprise crew's valor, and ultimately drives an excellent mystery-ridden plot. Characters remain endearing and well-rounded in this film, and the events they go through are harrowing enough to make you care for them. This film features quality photography and editing. Acting and writing are strong; even at their age, the original Star Trek cast members' performances still hold up, while Christopher Plummer plays the most deliciously fun and distinctive villain since The Wrath of Khan. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is extremely moody and intense, with a few upbeat parts, and I love it that way. A few cuts of this film exist now. The original theatrical cut is respectable as it is, but I've always been fond of the various home video cuts, which extend a number of scenes and bring more insight on the particulars of the story's conspiracy. The Undiscovered Country has always been a favorite of mine for its intensity and impressive action, but it's also full of heart and intelligence.
