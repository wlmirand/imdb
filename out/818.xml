  This Spike Lee film examines the life of an aspiring actress in New York. She is upset by the treatment of women in the movie industry during one of her screen tests with 'QT'. Out of work and desperate for money, she decides to take a job as a phone-sex operator. Here, unlike her previous dealings with potential employers, her (female) boss is kind, caring, and sensitive. Later, she begins to get too engrossed in her work and starts to lose touch with reality, represented by her friend and neighbor, Jimmy.

    Considered to be Spike's worst, I still found this engaging (ha ha) as his others. Randle holds her own as a New York actress, dropped from her agency after walking out on a QT audition. Idiot. Footnote: If you see how bad Randle's character's acting is, you question how she's come so far. Now out of the work, scoring the odd extra audition, Randle finds a new way to tap into her talents, as a phone sex operator. This is where the movie gets juicy, thanks to Randle's colorful callers, one Hispanic couple cracked me up. Unfortunately, one of her callers is a unhinged stalker, where the movie later shifts into drama, where originally, really, it was an intended drama. The stalker who played De Caprio's dying friend in The Basketball Diaries, a year earlier, sent some chills through me when getting to the crux his threats, on poor suffering Randle, where this change of mood to the film was good. Randle's ex, a good hearted thief (Issah Washington) isn't really, helping as wanting to get back with her. Her good friend/neighbor, Jimmy, of course played by Lee, who sort of bludges off of her, tries to talk her out of this dangerous and nowhere job. Lee's quite good in this, a proved actor, given the right environment. Too, Randle's being harassed by a middle aged Indian store owner, who rejects his advances. Underneath, this is a movie about woman's rights, not wanting to conform, like when being asked to strip for a movie audition, where she blows other ones later on these same grounds. It too shows how dangerous it can be, when you get too friendly with the wrong client, who sounds so nice and genuine over the phone. Women shouldn't have to tolerate drooling men, or sick minds. Randle's character's independence, I really liked, and she does have a real sexy voice. If you're a Lee fan, don't shun this one out, or if you're an avid Lee fan, it goes without saying. Opening score is great, as is a guest appearance by Madonna, fondling a cute dog, plus all those dropping phones in the street, in it's finale, with Randle and partner making up.

    Revisiting familiar territory he explored in his breakthrough independent She's Gotta Have It, Spike Lee takes a bigger budget, professional actors and delivers a far inferior product. It's a case of Spike having it and not knowing what to do with it. Aspiring actress Judy get's a screen test for a film being done by Quentin Tarantino. QT gets ugly though and this sour's Judy's career outlook. Burning bridges with her agent and acting coach and desperate for work she takes a job as a phone sex operator. She develops a knack for it and soon as "Girl 6" is in demand with customers. Dealing with warped customers and a former lover who shoplifts for a living Judy begins to jade and fade from reality. Sloppy, disjointed and in a constant state of funk Girl 6 is filled with lackluster performances and insipid "goofs" by Lee such as a smoldering cameo by Madonna reminding us just how bad an actress and self parody she is along with an obnoxious turn by Tarantino as himself. Not to be outdone Lee piles the detritus on by jamming a parody of the Jeffersons (with himself as George) into the torpid proceedings as well as a ham fisted, film school 101 Foxy Brown take. Therese Randle as Girl 6 is beautiful, flat and dull. Given every male in the pic is an insensitive lout, ( though Lee doing his "... have It" Mars with some of the same dialog lifted from the film redeems himself to a degree) one might understand why she stumbles through the picture shell shocked most of the time. Isiah Washington as an ex also gives a fatigued and unprepared turn as the principled booster. Girl 6 is a slow moving bore with Lee failing to amp up the drama with any degree of passion or deliver any character of substance with depth. At a loss to develop Judy he compensates with misogynistic stereotypes to dramatize her plight ala SGHI re-worked, colorized, sensationalized, and amazingly puerile for a feature film. It's all silly surliness.

    Spike Lee is one confusing filmmaker. Sometimes he makes masterpieces like (Bamboozled) or (25th Hour). Sometimes he makes good movies like (Jungle Fever), (Malcolm X). Or at worst just enjoyable ones like (Inside Man). But, on the other side, and what an other side that is, he makes weak rather stupid and aimless movies with enjoyable nothing, like (Summer of Sam), (He Got Game) or (Girl 6). The funny thing about this last bunch of movies is that it alleges a very serious case. And that what gets on your nerve badly, since the level of the movie is chokingly shitty in delivering whatever it says about such a case. I don't know. Is it vanity ? Is it the unsecured trial of new ways to tell a story ? Is it only laziness and sluggishness ? However what I do know is that I didn't conclude much of Girl 6, or enjoy anything of it as well ! The matter is easy to review. We have parallel story lines that go exactly like this : a black girl who works in the sex phone business; making a living during her suspended career as respectful actress wanna-be, her talks with a guy who loves her, a good neighbor, her fantasies about herself as one of the black icons in the history of Hollywood, her dealing with her customers as horny lonely mostly sad callers, one of them is a deranged, and an accident of a black poor child who's trying to survive. Actually the movie moves so outrageously tepid from storyline to the other in what seems as arithmetical order AND THAT WAS IT ! Making a movie about the sex phone business is so inspiring idea. Aside from being different  rarely seen  subject, it could read many delicate problems in one society. But with that script forget it ! The effort done by (Theresa Randle) to make her character believable and effective, the movie's only positive thing, was wholly wasted among the cold dealing with the material. The movie has so artistically poor, sometimes immature, personality. There is no focusing on one pure thing. And with silent drama and uninterested camera it made me want to shut it off. The love interest's storyline was handled in originally dull way. Actually everyone and everything looked idiot. And the end, oh the end, was the top of what this movie can achieve of stupidity; the heroine goes to a cinema that shows "girl 6" and there is a wide board hanging over the same street with the word "The End" ???!!! It's a journey from knowing that sex is needed obscenely trite whether in Hollywood or else. Women are goods to be sold for the men's desire anyhow. Or how we all live daydreams, having too hard time to fulfill them through big deranged world, or surrendering for them lastly. But as a matter of fact this movie has no clear point at all. Those were my wild guesses. So "maybe" it wanted to say something of them, none of them, all of them (!) Whatever its real meaning is it was shown as disarranged as all the disarranged scenes; that turned it eventually into a boring nonsense that has something serious but surely lost. This is bad movie, and a draft of real good one in the same time. Alas. Feverish P.S : did you notice how the standard of the celluloid was getting worse by the end of the scene just about every scene (with big black dots appear intermittently on the high right side of the screen) like the case with some ancient home made movies, the early poorly made new wave French films, or in the very old American ones, especially Tom & Jerry's ?! Is it a glitch? Or is it some *artistic* way from Lee to increase the size of this movie's crap ?!

    Girl 6 could have been helped from a little trimming, this is the first and probably foremost criticism. At 106 minutes, which should be average length for any movie to aspire to have, it's a few minutes too long and although one might lose the visual metaphor of the drop down the elevator, whatever it really means, the whole sub-plot involving the little girl falling down and breaking her head is unnecessary throughout and brings the film to a halt every time the 'newstory' segment pops up. And every so often, though not frequently, a technical touch or a performance might be a little too over the top, too flamboyant even for the Spike Lee Joint standard. But aside from this, Girl 6 is fun and enjoyable "fluff" for Spike Lee, which means that it's still risqu&eacute; and poignant and sharp-tongued (more than usual here and in more ways than one, some pun intended), and loaded with hit or miss R&B songs (this time by Prince, not quite as cool as Batman tracks but close). It's about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who hits roadblocks in her career when she gets told to take her top off for a "TOP Hollywood DIRECTOR" called "Q.T.", and played not too embarrassingly by the man himself. After some crappy gigs she goes for something that involves sex but only with the vocal chords, and indeed involves a kind of on-the-spot improvisation: phone-sex operator. From here the plot kind of takes off, however episodically and sometimes very loose in structure (there's some connection with one phone sex guy, Bob, whom Girl 6 crushes on and gets practically dumped, and a "Scary Caller" who treats her like dirt), and mostly involves us seeing what the person on the other line might look like in grainy video, and her own fantasies of movie-stardom from her favorites. This latter part provided the funniest and most visually creative scenes of the picture for me, particularly when Lee himself becomes Mr. Jefferson from the Jeffersons and when Girl 6 becomes Foxy Brown. While some of the visual flourishes we all like from a Lee Joint are present, and maybe too typical, it's fun to see Lee work through talky material, and all the actors have fun with their roles; especially Randle, who gives it her all in a seemingly breakthrough serio-comic turn and who gets to dress up and go for broke in many moments. Bottom line, it's not as bad as you've heard or seen it rated on this site, but it's also somewhat of a trifle in the Lee cannon, albeit within its own limitations almost (though not quite) the level of romantic-comedy we might expect from the director of She's Gotta Have It. Hey, it's better than She Hate Me, at the least, and somewhat less incoherent.

    Girl 6 is not a laugh-out-loud comedy so much as it is a satire of the nature of the struggle of the typical New York City actress with big dreams. She can hardly get a job and eventually resorts to using her talents to the most basic and competently lucrative degree as a phone sex girl. The film held my interest to a great degree, but only because of the visceral experience of watching it. John Corso and Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which ranges several different sorts of film stock, and Lee's consistent talent with the placement of music combined with the film's fascinating look is beautiful. There are several feelings that I felt that took me on a ride, but they were empty feelings, fleeting ominous moods, energy. The story doesn't fit. Thus, the movie is only stylistically moving. If the script had been directed by anyone else, it likely wouldn't be worth it at all. The substance of the film is basically nonexistent. The satire is not cohesive because there is no real point the film makes. This is certainly one of Spike Lee's worst films, but it certainly has a beauty lathered on top.

    Phone sex has often fallen short of my high expectations in carnal satisfaction because they lack the lustful passion that drives the performance given by the goddess Girl 6 in the Spike Lee joint "GIRL 6". If there ever was a fantasy woman of lust I believe Spike Lee found her in the gorgeous lust temptress Miss Theresa Randle.This film, ignited by Miss Randle lustful performance, showed the world how much power these true temptresses can have over their clients when they are gifted with the steamy ability of Girl 6. Her power is so great that it would almost seduce her very own soul. Nevertheless,I would give my soul, let alone the $4.99 a minute fee, so that girl 6 gives me the ultimate sexual fantasy that enthralls my every being. Overall, Girl 6 is the definitive number every red blooded American male should be dialing because the sensation can only be defined as....MMMMMM, YES, OH GOD, YESSSS!!!!! THANK YOU MISS RANDLE, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE please!!

    I'm really not sure what to make of this movie. Teresa Randle (Bad Boys, Bad Boys II) plays a struggling actress that takes a phone sex job and finds that she is good at it. Now, how can someone who got upset taking off her top for Quentin Tarantino want to do phone sex? Well, she did and was doing OK until she decided to get into the kinkier stuff. Then the job began taking over her. One thing that she did manage to do is gain enough confidence that , when she auditioned for that slime Ron Silver (I told you I hate that guy), she didn't even hesitate and just walked out when he asked her to do the same thing. What makes this movie hard to watch is that there are movies going on within the movie. I'm having a hard time figuring out what Director Spike Lee is trying to accomplish. Maybe that is why it didn't last very long in the theaters as no one else can figure out what he was trying to do either. The film featured others like Isaiah Washington (Grey's Anatomy), Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos), Richard Belzer (Law & Order SVU) Madonna, and Naomi Campbell (New York Sanitation Department). Of course, any movie that features Halle Berry, even briefly, is worth a look. I should have quit looking after her appearance.

    I am a huge Spike Lee fan and like any huge fan I enjoy everything he makes. Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be. Girl 6 is a mixed bag but it is watchable. I honestly can't say that I wouldn't sit down and watch the whole thing again. Girl 6 - **1/2 out of ****

    The most under-appreciated film in Spike Lee's filmography, and one of his very best, Girl 6 tells the story of a young woman (Theresa Randle), unhappy by a string of dead-end jobs and her mistreatment as a woman in the acting industry, who becomes a phone sex operator in an effort to make it on her own in New York City. Not only does her newfound job pay the bills, it also becomes a surprisingly empowering as well as addictive experience. Theresa Randle carries the film as the titular Girl 6, effectively providing an emotional focus to a film full of vibrant cinematography and first-rate cameos by Madonna, Quentin Tarantino, Debi Mazar, Naomi Campbell and Spike Lee himself. It is baffling why Girl 6 fared so poorly during its short and quiet 1996 theatrical run. After being unavailable for far, far too long, the film was released on DVD in March 2006, so hopefully it will gain the notoriety is so justly deserves.

    SPOILERS THROUGH: I haven't heard of to many movies that center on the phone sex industry before. I went into this movie not knowing to much about it although I did know it was a Spike Lee picture. And after seeing it I must say I thought it above average though I'm not surprised a lot of people may not like this as it is definitely not a mainstream flick. Girl 6 seems to be a very polarizing film in that people seem to either absolutely love it or despise it. I feel neither way, I liked it a lot and could see maybe loving it after I see it again a few times but as it stands now I see it as an interesting, unusual film that takes on a little bit of a taboo subject and features some great performances but that still has some flaws. I'm not going to get into reviewing the plot but will say that Theresa Randle should really be a household name as she was excellent. This would have been a very very difficult role to play (and play well) And she did that. I think the performance was perfect. I will also say I disagree with a lot of critics about the fact that this film almost makes the phone sex industry look to glamorous. I don't agree with that view at all, in fact one of the film's strength's to me, was how strong it was on mood and atmosphere. I do not think this was an industry made to look glamorous, I can't see many people watching this film and thinking:there's an easy, glamorous, exciting fun job. Quite the contrary, this film did with phone sex what "Boogie Nights" did with the porn industry and that is show the inner workings in a detached, dispassion rather monotonous way. I think the film's to be commended for that. Then there's the question of the movie maybe being unrealistic in Girl Six's gradual addiction to the job. In terms of that, it would be difficult for me to comment as I have no idea whether phone sex workers ever do in fact become addicted, but I will say that there isn't much in life that someone, somewhere, probably has not had an addiction to and I think Theresa Randle does a wonderful job in painting a poignantly sad picture of the loneliness that envelops Judy/Girl 6 so whether or not this plot line maybe realistic, strong character development helps with that. And I did enjoy the small appearances from some well known people such as Madonna and Tarrentino. As much as I enjoyed this film there were things that I didn't like although maybe I shouldn't call them flaws, more like frustrations. First, something that others have mentioned is the "why factor". I wanted to see more things explained and less ambiguity. A good example would be when she gives Bob her phone number. There's a lot that's not explained and I wish there had been at least one time we'd gotten to see Girl 6 actually interact with one of these customers in person or at least seen more character development of the men. I felt a lot of time was spent on the fantasy scenes, which I know many liked but that I thought went on to long. I felt to many scenes lasted to long, while others that seemed more interesting were dropped to quickly. I felt the movie was to disjointed at times and was a bit to arty for my tastes at times, with the camera work and some of the imagery. So I'd have to say, for me, this was a daring picture, an above average picture, a well acted(wonderfully acted) picture, but not a fantastic picture. Personally, I think many would hate it, even if it had little to no flaws at all. I mean any film that takes on a controversial subject matter is going to have a lot of detractors. My vote is 7 of 10. I'd definitely recommend it and see it again but there were a lot of moments I wasn't that into as well. Still worth seeing though and really should not have received some of the bad reviews it did from some critics considering all the garbage out there. My vote's 7 of 10.

We have parallel story lines that go exactly like this : a black girl who works in the sex phone business; making a living during her suspended career as respectful actress wanna-be, her talks with a guy who loves her, a good neighbor, her fantasies about herself as one of the black icons in the history of Hollywood, her dealing with her customers as horny lonely mostly sad callers, one of them is a deranged, and an accident of a black poor child who's trying to survive. Actually the movie moves so outrageously tepid from storyline to the other in what seems as arithmetical order AND THAT WAS IT ! Making a movie about the sex phone business is so inspiring idea. Aside from being different  rarely seen  subject, it could read many delicate problems in one society. But with that script forget it ! The effort done by (Theresa Randle) to make her character believable and effective, the movie's only positive thing, was wholly wasted among the cold dealing with the material. The movie has so artistically poor, sometimes immature, personality. There is no focusing on one pure thing. And with silent drama and uninterested camera it made me want to shut it off. The love interest's storyline was handled in originally dull way. Actually everyone and everything looked idiot. And the end, oh the end, was the top of what this movie can achieve of stupidity; the heroine goes to a cinema that shows "girl 6" and there is a wide board hanging over the same street with the word "The End" ???!!! It's a journey from knowing that sex is needed obscenely trite whether in Hollywood or else. Women are goods to be sold for the men's desire anyhow. Or how we all live daydreams, having too hard time to fulfill them through big deranged world, or surrendering for them lastly. But as a matter of fact this movie has no clear point at all. Those were my wild guesses. So "maybe" it wanted to say something of them, none of them, all of them (!) Whatever its real meaning is it was shown as disarranged as all the disarranged scenes; that turned it eventually into a boring nonsense that has something serious but surely lost. This is bad movie, and a draft of real good one in the same time. Alas. Feverish P.S : did you notice how the standard of the celluloid was getting worse by the end of the scene just about every scene (with big black dots appear intermittently on the high right side of the screen) like the case with some ancient home made movies, the early poorly made new wave French films, or in the very old American ones, especially Tom & Jerry's ?! Is it a glitch? Or is it some *artistic* way from Lee to increase the size of this movie's crap ?!

    Girl 6 could have been helped from a little trimming, this is the first and probably foremost criticism. At 106 minutes, which should be average length for any movie to aspire to have, it's a few minutes too long and although one might lose the visual metaphor of the drop down the elevator, whatever it really means, the whole sub-plot involving the little girl falling down and breaking her head is unnecessary throughout and brings the film to a halt every time the 'newstory' segment pops up. And every so often, though not frequently, a technical touch or a performance might be a little too over the top, too flamboyant even for the Spike Lee Joint standard. But aside from this, Girl 6 is fun and enjoyable "fluff" for Spike Lee, which means that it's still risqu&eacute; and poignant and sharp-tongued (more than usual here and in more ways than one, some pun intended), and loaded with hit or miss R&B songs (this time by Prince, not quite as cool as Batman tracks but close). It's about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who hits roadblocks in her career when she gets told to take her top off for a "TOP Hollywood DIRECTOR" called "Q.T.", and played not too embarrassingly by the man himself. After some crappy gigs she goes for something that involves sex but only with the vocal chords, and indeed involves a kind of on-the-spot improvisation: phone-sex operator. From here the plot kind of takes off, however episodically and sometimes very loose in structure (there's some connection with one phone sex guy, Bob, whom Girl 6 crushes on and gets practically dumped, and a "Scary Caller" who treats her like dirt), and mostly involves us seeing what the person on the other line might look like in grainy video, and her own fantasies of movie-stardom from her favorites. This latter part provided the funniest and most visually creative scenes of the picture for me, particularly when Lee himself becomes Mr. Jefferson from the Jeffersons and when Girl 6 becomes Foxy Brown. While some of the visual flourishes we all like from a Lee Joint are present, and maybe too typical, it's fun to see Lee work through talky material, and all the actors have fun with their roles; especially Randle, who gives it her all in a seemingly breakthrough serio-comic turn and who gets to dress up and go for broke in many moments. Bottom line, it's not as bad as you've heard or seen it rated on this site, but it's also somewhat of a trifle in the Lee cannon, albeit within its own limitations almost (though not quite) the level of romantic-comedy we might expect from the director of She's Gotta Have It. Hey, it's better than She Hate Me, at the least, and somewhat less incoherent.

    Girl 6 is not a laugh-out-loud comedy so much as it is a satire of the nature of the struggle of the typical New York City actress with big dreams. She can hardly get a job and eventually resorts to using her talents to the most basic and competently lucrative degree as a phone sex girl. The film held my interest to a great degree, but only because of the visceral experience of watching it. John Corso and Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which ranges several different sorts of film stock, and Lee's consistent talent with the placement of music combined with the film's fascinating look is beautiful. There are several feelings that I felt that took me on a ride, but they were empty feelings, fleeting ominous moods, energy. The story doesn't fit. Thus, the movie is only stylistically moving. If the script had been directed by anyone else, it likely wouldn't be worth it at all. The substance of the film is basically nonexistent. The satire is not cohesive because there is no real point the film makes. This is certainly one of Spike Lee's worst films, but it certainly has a beauty lathered on top.

    Phone sex has often fallen short of my high expectations in carnal satisfaction because they lack the lustful passion that drives the performance given by the goddess Girl 6 in the Spike Lee joint "GIRL 6". If there ever was a fantasy woman of lust I believe Spike Lee found her in the gorgeous lust temptress Miss Theresa Randle.This film, ignited by Miss Randle lustful performance, showed the world how much power these true temptresses can have over their clients when they are gifted with the steamy ability of Girl 6. Her power is so great that it would almost seduce her very own soul. Nevertheless,I would give my soul, let alone the $4.99 a minute fee, so that girl 6 gives me the ultimate sexual fantasy that enthralls my every being. Overall, Girl 6 is the definitive number every red blooded American male should be dialing because the sensation can only be defined as....MMMMMM, YES, OH GOD, YESSSS!!!!! THANK YOU MISS RANDLE, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE please!!

    I'm really not sure what to make of this movie. Teresa Randle (Bad Boys, Bad Boys II) plays a struggling actress that takes a phone sex job and finds that she is good at it. Now, how can someone who got upset taking off her top for Quentin Tarantino want to do phone sex? Well, she did and was doing OK until she decided to get into the kinkier stuff. Then the job began taking over her. One thing that she did manage to do is gain enough confidence that , when she auditioned for that slime Ron Silver (I told you I hate that guy), she didn't even hesitate and just walked out when he asked her to do the same thing. What makes this movie hard to watch is that there are movies going on within the movie. I'm having a hard time figuring out what Director Spike Lee is trying to accomplish. Maybe that is why it didn't last very long in the theaters as no one else can figure out what he was trying to do either. The film featured others like Isaiah Washington (Grey's Anatomy), Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos), Richard Belzer (Law & Order SVU) Madonna, and Naomi Campbell (New York Sanitation Department). Of course, any movie that features Halle Berry, even briefly, is worth a look. I should have quit looking after her appearance.

    I am a huge Spike Lee fan and like any huge fan I enjoy everything he makes. Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be. Girl 6 is a mixed bag but it is watchable. I honestly can't say that I wouldn't sit down and watch the whole thing again. Girl 6 - **1/2 out of ****

    The most under-appreciated film in Spike Lee's filmography, and one of his very best, Girl 6 tells the story of a young woman (Theresa Randle), unhappy by a string of dead-end jobs and her mistreatment as a woman in the acting industry, who becomes a phone sex operator in an effort to make it on her own in New York City. Not only does her newfound job pay the bills, it also becomes a surprisingly empowering as well as addictive experience. Theresa Randle carries the film as the titular Girl 6, effectively providing an emotional focus to a film full of vibrant cinematography and first-rate cameos by Madonna, Quentin Tarantino, Debi Mazar, Naomi Campbell and Spike Lee himself. It is baffling why Girl 6 fared so poorly during its short and quiet 1996 theatrical run. After being unavailable for far, far too long, the film was released on DVD in March 2006, so hopefully it will gain the notoriety is so justly deserves.

    SPOILERS THROUGH: I haven't heard of to many movies that center on the phone sex industry before. I went into this movie not knowing to much about it although I did know it was a Spike Lee picture. And after seeing it I must say I thought it above average though I'm not surprised a lot of people may not like this as it is definitely not a mainstream flick. Girl 6 seems to be a very polarizing film in that people seem to either absolutely love it or despise it. I feel neither way, I liked it a lot and could see maybe loving it after I see it again a few times but as it stands now I see it as an interesting, unusual film that takes on a little bit of a taboo subject and features some great performances but that still has some flaws. I'm not going to get into reviewing the plot but will say that Theresa Randle should really be a household name as she was excellent. This would have been a very very difficult role to play (and play well) And she did that. I think the performance was perfect. I will also say I disagree with a lot of critics about the fact that this film almost makes the phone sex industry look to glamorous. I don't agree with that view at all, in fact one of the film's strength's to me, was how strong it was on mood and atmosphere. I do not think this was an industry made to look glamorous, I can't see many people watching this film and thinking:there's an easy, glamorous, exciting fun job. Quite the contrary, this film did with phone sex what "Boogie Nights" did with the porn industry and that is show the inner workings in a detached, dispassion rather monotonous way. I think the film's to be commended for that. Then there's the question of the movie maybe being unrealistic in Girl Six's gradual addiction to the job. In terms of that, it would be difficult for me to comment as I have no idea whether phone sex workers ever do in fact become addicted, but I will say that there isn't much in life that someone, somewhere, probably has not had an addiction to and I think Theresa Randle does a wonderful job in painting a poignantly sad picture of the loneliness that envelops Judy/Girl 6 so whether or not this plot line maybe realistic, strong character development helps with that. And I did enjoy the small appearances from some well known people such as Madonna and Tarrentino. As much as I enjoyed this film there were things that I didn't like although maybe I shouldn't call them flaws, more like frustrations. First, something that others have mentioned is the "why factor". I wanted to see more things explained and less ambiguity. A good example would be when she gives Bob her phone number. There's a lot that's not explained and I wish there had been at least one time we'd gotten to see Girl 6 actually interact with one of these customers in person or at least seen more character development of the men. I felt a lot of time was spent on the fantasy scenes, which I know many liked but that I thought went on to long. I felt to many scenes lasted to long, while others that seemed more interesting were dropped to quickly. I felt the movie was to disjointed at times and was a bit to arty for my tastes at times, with the camera work and some of the imagery. So I'd have to say, for me, this was a daring picture, an above average picture, a well acted(wonderfully acted) picture, but not a fantastic picture. Personally, I think many would hate it, even if it had little to no flaws at all. I mean any film that takes on a controversial subject matter is going to have a lot of detractors. My vote is 7 of 10. I'd definitely recommend it and see it again but there were a lot of moments I wasn't that into as well. Still worth seeing though and really should not have received some of the bad reviews it did from some critics considering all the garbage out there. My vote's 7 of 10.

    Considered to be Spike's worst, I still found this engaging (ha ha) as his others. Randle holds her own as a New York actress, dropped from her agency after walking out on a QT audition. Idiot. Footnote: If you see how bad Randle's character's acting is, you question how she's come so far. Now out of the work, scoring the odd extra audition, Randle finds a new way to tap into her talents, as a phone sex operator. This is where the movie gets juicy, thanks to Randle's colorful callers, one Hispanic couple cracked me up. Unfortunately, one of her callers is a unhinged stalker, where the movie later shifts into drama, where originally, really, it was an intended drama. The stalker who played De Caprio's dying friend in The Basketball Diaries, a year earlier, sent some chills through me when getting to the crux his threats, on poor suffering Randle, where this change of mood to the film was good. Randle's ex, a good hearted thief (Issah Washington) isn't really, helping as wanting to get back with her. Her good friend/neighbor, Jimmy, of course played by Lee, who sort of bludges off of her, tries to talk her out of this dangerous and nowhere job. Lee's quite good in this, a proved actor, given the right environment. Too, Randle's being harassed by a middle aged Indian store owner, who rejects his advances. Underneath, this is a movie about woman's rights, not wanting to conform, like when being asked to strip for a movie audition, where she blows other ones later on these same grounds. It too shows how dangerous it can be, when you get too friendly with the wrong client, who sounds so nice and genuine over the phone. Women shouldn't have to tolerate drooling men, or sick minds. Randle's character's independence, I really liked, and she does have a real sexy voice. If you're a Lee fan, don't shun this one out, or if you're an avid Lee fan, it goes without saying. Opening score is great, as is a guest appearance by Madonna, fondling a cute dog, plus all those dropping phones in the street, in it's finale, with Randle and partner making up.

    Revisiting familiar territory he explored in his breakthrough independent She's Gotta Have It, Spike Lee takes a bigger budget, professional actors and delivers a far inferior product. It's a case of Spike having it and not knowing what to do with it. Aspiring actress Judy get's a screen test for a film being done by Quentin Tarantino. QT gets ugly though and this sour's Judy's career outlook. Burning bridges with her agent and acting coach and desperate for work she takes a job as a phone sex operator. She develops a knack for it and soon as "Girl 6" is in demand with customers. Dealing with warped customers and a former lover who shoplifts for a living Judy begins to jade and fade from reality. Sloppy, disjointed and in a constant state of funk Girl 6 is filled with lackluster performances and insipid "goofs" by Lee such as a smoldering cameo by Madonna reminding us just how bad an actress and self parody she is along with an obnoxious turn by Tarantino as himself. Not to be outdone Lee piles the detritus on by jamming a parody of the Jeffersons (with himself as George) into the torpid proceedings as well as a ham fisted, film school 101 Foxy Brown take. Therese Randle as Girl 6 is beautiful, flat and dull. Given every male in the pic is an insensitive lout, ( though Lee doing his "... have It" Mars with some of the same dialog lifted from the film redeems himself to a degree) one might understand why she stumbles through the picture shell shocked most of the time. Isiah Washington as an ex also gives a fatigued and unprepared turn as the principled booster. Girl 6 is a slow moving bore with Lee failing to amp up the drama with any degree of passion or deliver any character of substance with depth. At a loss to develop Judy he compensates with misogynistic stereotypes to dramatize her plight ala SGHI re-worked, colorized, sensationalized, and amazingly puerile for a feature film. It's all silly surliness.

    Spike Lee is one confusing filmmaker. Sometimes he makes masterpieces like (Bamboozled) or (25th Hour). Sometimes he makes good movies like (Jungle Fever), (Malcolm X). Or at worst just enjoyable ones like (Inside Man). But, on the other side, and what an other side that is, he makes weak rather stupid and aimless movies with enjoyable nothing, like (Summer of Sam), (He Got Game) or (Girl 6). The funny thing about this last bunch of movies is that it alleges a very serious case. And that what gets on your nerve badly, since the level of the movie is chokingly shitty in delivering whatever it says about such a case. I don't know. Is it vanity ? Is it the unsecured trial of new ways to tell a story ? Is it only laziness and sluggishness ? However what I do know is that I didn't conclude much of Girl 6, or enjoy anything of it as well ! The matter is easy to review.

    I'm really not sure what to make of this movie. Teresa Randle (Bad Boys, Bad Boys II) plays a struggling actress that takes a phone sex job and finds that she is good at it. Now, how can someone who got upset taking off her top for Quentin Tarantino want to do phone sex? Well, she did and was doing OK until she decided to get into the kinkier stuff. Then the job began taking over her. One thing that she did manage to do is gain enough confidence that , when she auditioned for that slime Ron Silver (I told you I hate that guy), she didn't even hesitate and just walked out when he asked her to do the same thing. What makes this movie hard to watch is that there are movies going on within the movie. I'm having a hard time figuring out what Director Spike Lee is trying to accomplish. Maybe that is why it didn't last very long in the theaters as no one else can figure out what he was trying to do either. The film featured others like Isaiah Washington (Grey's Anatomy), Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos), Richard Belzer (Law & Order SVU) Madonna, and Naomi Campbell (New York Sanitation Department). Of course, any movie that features Halle Berry, even briefly, is worth a look. I should have quit looking after her appearance.

    I am a huge Spike Lee fan and like any huge fan I enjoy everything he makes. Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be. Girl 6 is a mixed bag but it is watchable. I honestly can't say that I wouldn't sit down and watch the whole thing again. Girl 6 - **1/2 out of ****

    The most under-appreciated film in Spike Lee's filmography, and one of his very best, Girl 6 tells the story of a young woman (Theresa Randle), unhappy by a string of dead-end jobs and her mistreatment as a woman in the acting industry, who becomes a phone sex operator in an effort to make it on her own in New York City. Not only does her newfound job pay the bills, it also becomes a surprisingly empowering as well as addictive experience. Theresa Randle carries the film as the titular Girl 6, effectively providing an emotional focus to a film full of vibrant cinematography and first-rate cameos by Madonna, Quentin Tarantino, Debi Mazar, Naomi Campbell and Spike Lee himself. It is baffling why Girl 6 fared so poorly during its short and quiet 1996 theatrical run. After being unavailable for far, far too long, the film was released on DVD in March 2006, so hopefully it will gain the notoriety is so justly deserves.

    SPOILERS THROUGH: I haven't heard of to many movies that center on the phone sex industry before. I went into this movie not knowing to much about it although I did know it was a Spike Lee picture. And after seeing it I must say I thought it above average though I'm not surprised a lot of people may not like this as it is definitely not a mainstream flick. Girl 6 seems to be a very polarizing film in that people seem to either absolutely love it or despise it. I feel neither way, I liked it a lot and could see maybe loving it after I see it again a few times but as it stands now I see it as an interesting, unusual film that takes on a little bit of a taboo subject and features some great performances but that still has some flaws. I'm not going to get into reviewing the plot but will say that Theresa Randle should really be a household name as she was excellent. This would have been a very very difficult role to play (and play well) And she did that. I think the performance was perfect. I will also say I disagree with a lot of critics about the fact that this film almost makes the phone sex industry look to glamorous. I don't agree with that view at all, in fact one of the film's strength's to me, was how strong it was on mood and atmosphere. I do not think this was an industry made to look glamorous, I can't see many people watching this film and thinking:there's an easy, glamorous, exciting fun job. Quite the contrary, this film did with phone sex what "Boogie Nights" did with the porn industry and that is show the inner workings in a detached, dispassion rather monotonous way. I think the film's to be commended for that. Then there's the question of the movie maybe being unrealistic in Girl Six's gradual addiction to the job. In terms of that, it would be difficult for me to comment as I have no idea whether phone sex workers ever do in fact become addicted, but I will say that there isn't much in life that someone, somewhere, probably has not had an addiction to and I think Theresa Randle does a wonderful job in painting a poignantly sad picture of the loneliness that envelops Judy/Girl 6 so whether or not this plot line maybe realistic, strong character development helps with that. And I did enjoy the small appearances from some well known people such as Madonna and Tarrentino. As much as I enjoyed this film there were things that I didn't like although maybe I shouldn't call them flaws, more like frustrations. First, something that others have mentioned is the "why factor". I wanted to see more things explained and less ambiguity. A good example would be when she gives Bob her phone number. There's a lot that's not explained and I wish there had been at least one time we'd gotten to see Girl 6 actually interact with one of these customers in person or at least seen more character development of the men. I felt a lot of time was spent on the fantasy scenes, which I know many liked but that I thought went on to long. I felt to many scenes lasted to long, while others that seemed more interesting were dropped to quickly. I felt the movie was to disjointed at times and was a bit to arty for my tastes at times, with the camera work and some of the imagery. So I'd have to say, for me, this was a daring picture, an above average picture, a well acted(wonderfully acted) picture, but not a fantastic picture. Personally, I think many would hate it, even if it had little to no flaws at all. I mean any film that takes on a controversial subject matter is going to have a lot of detractors. My vote is 7 of 10. I'd definitely recommend it and see it again but there were a lot of moments I wasn't that into as well. Still worth seeing though and really should not have received some of the bad reviews it did from some critics considering all the garbage out there. My vote's 7 of 10.

    Considered to be Spike's worst, I still found this engaging (ha ha) as his others. Randle holds her own as a New York actress, dropped from her agency after walking out on a QT audition. Idiot. Footnote: If you see how bad Randle's character's acting is, you question how she's come so far. Now out of the work, scoring the odd extra audition, Randle finds a new way to tap into her talents, as a phone sex operator. This is where the movie gets juicy, thanks to Randle's colorful callers, one Hispanic couple cracked me up. Unfortunately, one of her callers is a unhinged stalker, where the movie later shifts into drama, where originally, really, it was an intended drama. The stalker who played De Caprio's dying friend in The Basketball Diaries, a year earlier, sent some chills through me when getting to the crux his threats, on poor suffering Randle, where this change of mood to the film was good. Randle's ex, a good hearted thief (Issah Washington) isn't really, helping as wanting to get back with her. Her good friend/neighbor, Jimmy, of course played by Lee, who sort of bludges off of her, tries to talk her out of this dangerous and nowhere job. Lee's quite good in this, a proved actor, given the right environment. Too, Randle's being harassed by a middle aged Indian store owner, who rejects his advances. Underneath, this is a movie about woman's rights, not wanting to conform, like when being asked to strip for a movie audition, where she blows other ones later on these same grounds. It too shows how dangerous it can be, when you get too friendly with the wrong client, who sounds so nice and genuine over the phone. Women shouldn't have to tolerate drooling men, or sick minds. Randle's character's independence, I really liked, and she does have a real sexy voice. If you're a Lee fan, don't shun this one out, or if you're an avid Lee fan, it goes without saying. Opening score is great, as is a guest appearance by Madonna, fondling a cute dog, plus all those dropping phones in the street, in it's finale, with Randle and partner making up.

    Revisiting familiar territory he explored in his breakthrough independent She's Gotta Have It, Spike Lee takes a bigger budget, professional actors and delivers a far inferior product. It's a case of Spike having it and not knowing what to do with it. Aspiring actress Judy get's a screen test for a film being done by Quentin Tarantino. QT gets ugly though and this sour's Judy's career outlook. Burning bridges with her agent and acting coach and desperate for work she takes a job as a phone sex operator. She develops a knack for it and soon as "Girl 6" is in demand with customers. Dealing with warped customers and a former lover who shoplifts for a living Judy begins to jade and fade from reality. Sloppy, disjointed and in a constant state of funk Girl 6 is filled with lackluster performances and insipid "goofs" by Lee such as a smoldering cameo by Madonna reminding us just how bad an actress and self parody she is along with an obnoxious turn by Tarantino as himself. Not to be outdone Lee piles the detritus on by jamming a parody of the Jeffersons (with himself as George) into the torpid proceedings as well as a ham fisted, film school 101 Foxy Brown take. Therese Randle as Girl 6 is beautiful, flat and dull. Given every male in the pic is an insensitive lout, ( though Lee doing his "... have It" Mars with some of the same dialog lifted from the film redeems himself to a degree) one might understand why she stumbles through the picture shell shocked most of the time. Isiah Washington as an ex also gives a fatigued and unprepared turn as the principled booster. Girl 6 is a slow moving bore with Lee failing to amp up the drama with any degree of passion or deliver any character of substance with depth. At a loss to develop Judy he compensates with misogynistic stereotypes to dramatize her plight ala SGHI re-worked, colorized, sensationalized, and amazingly puerile for a feature film. It's all silly surliness.

    Spike Lee is one confusing filmmaker. Sometimes he makes masterpieces like (Bamboozled) or (25th Hour). Sometimes he makes good movies like (Jungle Fever), (Malcolm X). Or at worst just enjoyable ones like (Inside Man). But, on the other side, and what an other side that is, he makes weak rather stupid and aimless movies with enjoyable nothing, like (Summer of Sam), (He Got Game) or (Girl 6). The funny thing about this last bunch of movies is that it alleges a very serious case. And that what gets on your nerve badly, since the level of the movie is chokingly shitty in delivering whatever it says about such a case. I don't know. Is it vanity ? Is it the unsecured trial of new ways to tell a story ? Is it only laziness and sluggishness ? However what I do know is that I didn't conclude much of Girl 6, or enjoy anything of it as well ! The matter is easy to review. We have parallel story lines that go exactly like this : a black girl who works in the sex phone business; making a living during her suspended career as respectful actress wanna-be, her talks with a guy who loves her, a good neighbor, her fantasies about herself as one of the black icons in the history of Hollywood, her dealing with her customers as horny lonely mostly sad callers, one of them is a deranged, and an accident of a black poor child who's trying to survive. Actually the movie moves so outrageously tepid from storyline to the other in what seems as arithmetical order AND THAT WAS IT ! Making a movie about the sex phone business is so inspiring idea. Aside from being different  rarely seen  subject, it could read many delicate problems in one society. But with that script forget it ! The effort done by (Theresa Randle) to make her character believable and effective, the movie's only positive thing, was wholly wasted among the cold dealing with the material. The movie has so artistically poor, sometimes immature, personality. There is no focusing on one pure thing. And with silent drama and uninterested camera it made me want to shut it off. The love interest's storyline was handled in originally dull way. Actually everyone and everything looked idiot. And the end, oh the end, was the top of what this movie can achieve of stupidity; the heroine goes to a cinema that shows "girl 6" and there is a wide board hanging over the same street with the word "The End" ???!!! It's a journey from knowing that sex is needed obscenely trite whether in Hollywood or else. Women are goods to be sold for the men's desire anyhow. Or how we all live daydreams, having too hard time to fulfill them through big deranged world, or surrendering for them lastly. But as a matter of fact this movie has no clear point at all. Those were my wild guesses. So "maybe" it wanted to say something of them, none of them, all of them (!) Whatever its real meaning is it was shown as disarranged as all the disarranged scenes; that turned it eventually into a boring nonsense that has something serious but surely lost. This is bad movie, and a draft of real good one in the same time. Alas. Feverish P.S : did you notice how the standard of the celluloid was getting worse by the end of the scene just about every scene (with big black dots appear intermittently on the high right side of the screen) like the case with some ancient home made movies, the early poorly made new wave French films, or in the very old American ones, especially Tom & Jerry's ?! Is it a glitch? Or is it some *artistic* way from Lee to increase the size of this movie's crap ?!

    Girl 6 could have been helped from a little trimming, this is the first and probably foremost criticism. At 106 minutes, which should be average length for any movie to aspire to have, it's a few minutes too long and although one might lose the visual metaphor of the drop down the elevator, whatever it really means, the whole sub-plot involving the little girl falling down and breaking her head is unnecessary throughout and brings the film to a halt every time the 'newstory' segment pops up. And every so often, though not frequently, a technical touch or a performance might be a little too over the top, too flamboyant even for the Spike Lee Joint standard. But aside from this, Girl 6 is fun and enjoyable "fluff" for Spike Lee, which means that it's still risqu&eacute; and poignant and sharp-tongued (more than usual here and in more ways than one, some pun intended), and loaded with hit or miss R&B songs (this time by Prince, not quite as cool as Batman tracks but close). It's about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who hits roadblocks in her career when she gets told to take her top off for a "TOP Hollywood DIRECTOR" called "Q.T.", and played not too embarrassingly by the man himself. After some crappy gigs she goes for something that involves sex but only with the vocal chords, and indeed involves a kind of on-the-spot improvisation: phone-sex operator. From here the plot kind of takes off, however episodically and sometimes very loose in structure (there's some connection with one phone sex guy, Bob, whom Girl 6 crushes on and gets practically dumped, and a "Scary Caller" who treats her like dirt), and mostly involves us seeing what the person on the other line might look like in grainy video, and her own fantasies of movie-stardom from her favorites. This latter part provided the funniest and most visually creative scenes of the picture for me, particularly when Lee himself becomes Mr. Jefferson from the Jeffersons and when Girl 6 becomes Foxy Brown. While some of the visual flourishes we all like from a Lee Joint are present, and maybe too typical, it's fun to see Lee work through talky material, and all the actors have fun with their roles; especially Randle, who gives it her all in a seemingly breakthrough serio-comic turn and who gets to dress up and go for broke in many moments. Bottom line, it's not as bad as you've heard or seen it rated on this site, but it's also somewhat of a trifle in the Lee cannon, albeit within its own limitations almost (though not quite) the level of romantic-comedy we might expect from the director of She's Gotta Have It. Hey, it's better than She Hate Me, at the least, and somewhat less incoherent.

    Girl 6 is not a laugh-out-loud comedy so much as it is a satire of the nature of the struggle of the typical New York City actress with big dreams. She can hardly get a job and eventually resorts to using her talents to the most basic and competently lucrative degree as a phone sex girl. The film held my interest to a great degree, but only because of the visceral experience of watching it. John Corso and Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which ranges several different sorts of film stock, and Lee's consistent talent with the placement of music combined with the film's fascinating look is beautiful. There are several feelings that I felt that took me on a ride, but they were empty feelings, fleeting ominous moods, energy. The story doesn't fit. Thus, the movie is only stylistically moving. If the script had been directed by anyone else, it likely wouldn't be worth it at all. The substance of the film is basically nonexistent. The satire is not cohesive because there is no real point the film makes. This is certainly one of Spike Lee's worst films, but it certainly has a beauty lathered on top.

    Phone sex has often fallen short of my high expectations in carnal satisfaction because they lack the lustful passion that drives the performance given by the goddess Girl 6 in the Spike Lee joint "GIRL 6". If there ever was a fantasy woman of lust I believe Spike Lee found her in the gorgeous lust temptress Miss Theresa Randle.This film, ignited by Miss Randle lustful performance, showed the world how much power these true temptresses can have over their clients when they are gifted with the steamy ability of Girl 6. Her power is so great that it would almost seduce her very own soul. Nevertheless,I would give my soul, let alone the $4.99 a minute fee, so that girl 6 gives me the ultimate sexual fantasy that enthralls my every being. Overall, Girl 6 is the definitive number every red blooded American male should be dialing because the sensation can only be defined as....MMMMMM, YES, OH GOD, YESSSS!!!!! THANK YOU MISS RANDLE, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE please!!

So I'd have to say, for me, this was a daring picture, an above average picture, a well acted(wonderfully acted) picture, but not a fantastic picture. Personally, I think many would hate it, even if it had little to no flaws at all. I mean any film that takes on a controversial subject matter is going to have a lot of detractors. My vote is 7 of 10. I'd definitely recommend it and see it again but there were a lot of moments I wasn't that into as well. Still worth seeing though and really should not have received some of the bad reviews it did from some critics considering all the garbage out there. My vote's 7 of 10.
