 <sinopse>
  Three drag queens travel cross-country until their car breaks down, leaving them stranded in a small town.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After jointly winning a local drag queen pageant in New York City, Noxeema Jackson and Vida Boheme win the right and are given the round trip airfare to compete in the Drag Queen of America pageant in Hollywood, California. Noxeema sees herself as the next , who bucked the trend of most black American movie actresses of her time by never playing the slave house maid. Vida's style reflects her past of growing up in upper class suburban Pennsylvania. One of their fellow New York contestants, Chi-Chi Rodriguez, is a straight-talking but naive and inexperienced drag queen. Seeing that Chi-Chi needs some drag queen confidence (despite her bravada), Vida and a reluctant Noxeema decide to cash in their plane tickets and buy an older model Cadillac convertible and drive to Hollywood with Chi-Chi. Their drive takes them through much of the country where alternate lifestyles are less tolerated than they may be in New York or Los Angeles. The three have an extended stay in small...

    With a movie I must have seen dozens of times back in the 1990s, but haven't since that decade ended, I've been meaning to revisit my favorite on-screen drag queens: Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi for a long time. In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the "butch" action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the "game," came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing  to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners. While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed. At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a "redneck, closed-minded" rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town. This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time: AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages. Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This "weekend delay" in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today. Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream  Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.) The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn  which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

    It's worth to see this movie just to see Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo in drag! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish as the aforementioned actors try to make it to a "drag queen competition" and get stuck in a small town and one impossible situation after another. My personal favorites are the scenes with Robin Williams in it and the one where the cop in it (where he pulls them over) and his subsequent scenes. The final scene was great too. Overall, this movie has great lines too. Get this for the great DVD extras too-you will love them! They obviously were aiming for the star appeal-that worked too. *** out of ****

    It is a comedy about three New York drag queens who embark on a road trip but, due to technical reasons, are forced to stay in a township - where most of the movie takes place. The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the "ladies" carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie. Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

    The film is embellished as an American version of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994) - which I think I watched more than 10 years ago and now my long-term memory fails me again) - however, certainly its lavish drag-queen attire exerts its utmost momentum to be both optically impressive and controversially sensationalistic as what PRISCILLA has managed to express. The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps: this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

    This movie demonstrates how hilarious the life of a drag queen can be especially if your as serious as these characters. I know many people who are drag queens and haters go hate something else. They have a passion just like you and me and it happens to be DRAG. If you have some stickler on who these people are, get over it because they love what they do! This movie is cute, funny, and has some FIERCE outfits. I found the humor in this movie very truthful and sincere. Classic gay movie and makes you wanna get up and cheer for these people. I love how Chi Chi isn't a drag queen but a drag Princess. don't let anyone tell you this is a bad movie because it's is the complete opposite. You tell her Noxeema!

    I personally think it was an over all great movie. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguazamo were great in this movie they all showed how easy it is to play a woman. I also think that Patrick Swayze made for a great looking woman. Wesley snipes looked OK as a woman. John leguazamo also made a good looking woman. I also loved the fact that Rupaul made a cameo in the beginning. I often wonder if the contest is real. I know plenty of people who would love to participate in it. This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.

He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.

    With a movie I must have seen dozens of times back in the 1990s, but haven't since that decade ended, I've been meaning to revisit my favorite on-screen drag queens: Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi for a long time. In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the "butch" action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the "game," came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing  to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners. While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed. At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a "redneck, closed-minded" rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town. This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time: AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages. Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This "weekend delay" in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today. Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream  Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.) The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn  which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

    It's worth to see this movie just to see Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo in drag! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish as the aforementioned actors try to make it to a "drag queen competition" and get stuck in a small town and one impossible situation after another. My personal favorites are the scenes with Robin Williams in it and the one where the cop in it (where he pulls them over) and his subsequent scenes. The final scene was great too. Overall, this movie has great lines too. Get this for the great DVD extras too-you will love them! They obviously were aiming for the star appeal-that worked too. *** out of ****

    It is a comedy about three New York drag queens who embark on a road trip but, due to technical reasons, are forced to stay in a township - where most of the movie takes place. The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the "ladies" carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie. Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

    The film is embellished as an American version of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994) - which I think I watched more than 10 years ago and now my long-term memory fails me again) - however, certainly its lavish drag-queen attire exerts its utmost momentum to be both optically impressive and controversially sensationalistic as what PRISCILLA has managed to express. The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps: this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

    This movie demonstrates how hilarious the life of a drag queen can be especially if your as serious as these characters. I know many people who are drag queens and haters go hate something else. They have a passion just like you and me and it happens to be DRAG. If you have some stickler on who these people are, get over it because they love what they do! This movie is cute, funny, and has some FIERCE outfits. I found the humor in this movie very truthful and sincere. Classic gay movie and makes you wanna get up and cheer for these people. I love how Chi Chi isn't a drag queen but a drag Princess. don't let anyone tell you this is a bad movie because it's is the complete opposite. You tell her Noxeema!

    I personally think it was an over all great movie. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguazamo were great in this movie they all showed how easy it is to play a woman. I also think that Patrick Swayze made for a great looking woman. Wesley snipes looked OK as a woman. John leguazamo also made a good looking woman. I also loved the fact that Rupaul made a cameo in the beginning. I often wonder if the contest is real. I know plenty of people who would love to participate in it. This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!).

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.

    With a movie I must have seen dozens of times back in the 1990s, but haven't since that decade ended, I've been meaning to revisit my favorite on-screen drag queens: Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi for a long time. In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the "butch" action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the "game," came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing  to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners. While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed. At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a "redneck, closed-minded" rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town. This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time: AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages. Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This "weekend delay" in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today. Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream  Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.) The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn  which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

    It's worth to see this movie just to see Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo in drag! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish as the aforementioned actors try to make it to a "drag queen competition" and get stuck in a small town and one impossible situation after another. My personal favorites are the scenes with Robin Williams in it and the one where the cop in it (where he pulls them over) and his subsequent scenes. The final scene was great too. Overall, this movie has great lines too. Get this for the great DVD extras too-you will love them! They obviously were aiming for the star appeal-that worked too. *** out of ****

    It is a comedy about three New York drag queens who embark on a road trip but, due to technical reasons, are forced to stay in a township - where most of the movie takes place. The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the "ladies" carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie. Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

    The film is embellished as an American version of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994) - which I think I watched more than 10 years ago and now my long-term memory fails me again) - however, certainly its lavish drag-queen attire exerts its utmost momentum to be both optically impressive and controversially sensationalistic as what PRISCILLA has managed to express. The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps: this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

    This movie demonstrates how hilarious the life of a drag queen can be especially if your as serious as these characters. I know many people who are drag queens and haters go hate something else. They have a passion just like you and me and it happens to be DRAG. If you have some stickler on who these people are, get over it because they love what they do! This movie is cute, funny, and has some FIERCE outfits. I found the humor in this movie very truthful and sincere. Classic gay movie and makes you wanna get up and cheer for these people. I love how Chi Chi isn't a drag queen but a drag Princess. don't let anyone tell you this is a bad movie because it's is the complete opposite. You tell her Noxeema!

    I personally think it was an over all great movie. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguazamo were great in this movie they all showed how easy it is to play a woman. I also think that Patrick Swayze made for a great looking woman. Wesley snipes looked OK as a woman. John leguazamo also made a good looking woman. I also loved the fact that Rupaul made a cameo in the beginning. I often wonder if the contest is real. I know plenty of people who would love to participate in it. This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.

    With a movie I must have seen dozens of times back in the 1990s, but haven't since that decade ended, I've been meaning to revisit my favorite on-screen drag queens: Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi for a long time. In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the "butch" action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the "game," came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing  to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners. While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed. At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a "redneck, closed-minded" rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town. This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time: AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages. Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This "weekend delay" in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today. Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream  Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.) The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn  which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

    It's worth to see this movie just to see Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo in drag! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish as the aforementioned actors try to make it to a "drag queen competition" and get stuck in a small town and one impossible situation after another. My personal favorites are the scenes with Robin Williams in it and the one where the cop in it (where he pulls them over) and his subsequent scenes. The final scene was great too. Overall, this movie has great lines too. Get this for the great DVD extras too-you will love them! They obviously were aiming for the star appeal-that worked too. *** out of ****

    It is a comedy about three New York drag queens who embark on a road trip but, due to technical reasons, are forced to stay in a township - where most of the movie takes place. The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the "ladies" carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie. Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

    The film is embellished as an American version of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994) - which I think I watched more than 10 years ago and now my long-term memory fails me again) - however, certainly its lavish drag-queen attire exerts its utmost momentum to be both optically impressive and controversially sensationalistic as what PRISCILLA has managed to express. The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps: this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

    This movie demonstrates how hilarious the life of a drag queen can be especially if your as serious as these characters. I know many people who are drag queens and haters go hate something else. They have a passion just like you and me and it happens to be DRAG. If you have some stickler on who these people are, get over it because they love what they do! This movie is cute, funny, and has some FIERCE outfits. I found the humor in this movie very truthful and sincere. Classic gay movie and makes you wanna get up and cheer for these people. I love how Chi Chi isn't a drag queen but a drag Princess. don't let anyone tell you this is a bad movie because it's is the complete opposite. You tell her Noxeema!

    I personally think it was an over all great movie. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguazamo were great in this movie they all showed how easy it is to play a woman. I also think that Patrick Swayze made for a great looking woman. Wesley snipes looked OK as a woman. John leguazamo also made a good looking woman. I also loved the fact that Rupaul made a cameo in the beginning. I often wonder if the contest is real. I know plenty of people who would love to participate in it. This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.

    With a movie I must have seen dozens of times back in the 1990s, but haven't since that decade ended, I've been meaning to revisit my favorite on-screen drag queens: Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi for a long time. In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the "butch" action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the "game," came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing  to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners. While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed. At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a "redneck, closed-minded" rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town. This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time: AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages. Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This "weekend delay" in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today. Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream  Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.) The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn  which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

    It's worth to see this movie just to see Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo in drag! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish as the aforementioned actors try to make it to a "drag queen competition" and get stuck in a small town and one impossible situation after another. My personal favorites are the scenes with Robin Williams in it and the one where the cop in it (where he pulls them over) and his subsequent scenes. The final scene was great too. Overall, this movie has great lines too. Get this for the great DVD extras too-you will love them! They obviously were aiming for the star appeal-that worked too. *** out of ****

    It is a comedy about three New York drag queens who embark on a road trip but, due to technical reasons, are forced to stay in a township - where most of the movie takes place. The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the "ladies" carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie. Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

    The film is embellished as an American version of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994) - which I think I watched more than 10 years ago and now my long-term memory fails me again) - however, certainly its lavish drag-queen attire exerts its utmost momentum to be both optically impressive and controversially sensationalistic as what PRISCILLA has managed to express. The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps: this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

    This movie demonstrates how hilarious the life of a drag queen can be especially if your as serious as these characters. I know many people who are drag queens and haters go hate something else. They have a passion just like you and me and it happens to be DRAG. If you have some stickler on who these people are, get over it because they love what they do! This movie is cute, funny, and has some FIERCE outfits. I found the humor in this movie very truthful and sincere. Classic gay movie and makes you wanna get up and cheer for these people. I love how Chi Chi isn't a drag queen but a drag Princess. don't let anyone tell you this is a bad movie because it's is the complete opposite. You tell her Noxeema!

    I personally think it was an over all great movie. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguazamo were great in this movie they all showed how easy it is to play a woman. I also think that Patrick Swayze made for a great looking woman. Wesley snipes looked OK as a woman. John leguazamo also made a good looking woman. I also loved the fact that Rupaul made a cameo in the beginning. I often wonder if the contest is real. I know plenty of people who would love to participate in it. This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

This movie has opened doors for many drag queens to be open about them selves. I know quite a few drag queens who are more open because of this movie. Most guys tho do not make for good looking women but the two in this film that i mentioned do. So hope u enjoy and understand my review of this great movie.

    To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar turned out to be one of the best comedies I have ever seen! Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo were excellent in this. It was so funny to watch three really manly men being portrayed as three drag queens. They did such an excellent job with bringing their characters to life. The plot revolves around three drag queens named Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi (Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) who head out to California to win the drag queen contest. On the way there, they get pulled over by a cop who tries to come on to Vida. After knocking him out after the cop tries to feel him up, they take off and leave him there in the middle of the road. After driving for a while, their car breaks down and they stop in some small town. After staying in the town for a while, they bring the town back to life and change the people in ways they thought they thought they would never change. Soon, the police officer they knocked out soon catches up with them and swears to arrest them at any cost. But, the townsfolk won't allow it so they all dress up like drag queens to get the sheriff to leave them alone. It's a really funny comedy. You don't want to miss out on this one. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Great movie!

    I saw this movie when it first came out in 1995 with my twin brother. We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

    I saw this on TV the night before we started filming my 'Pumpkin Man 2' movie, and I thought this was really good, and had a great storyline. It's always fun to see men dressed up as women. Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes made awesome drag queens! Vida, Chi-Chi, and Noxeema are on a road trip to enter the 'drag queen of the year' contest in New York City. Their car dies and they must stay in a small town for the weekend. They befriend the locals, and soon become a big part of the town, until the Sheriff shows up and wants to arrest the drag queens. I love how everybody in town stick up for them. I highly recommend TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR!!!

    I saw this movie back in 1995 when it was released. At the time, all three lead actors were still quite contemporary. Seeing the three of them playing roles as drag queens was just classic (not to mention hysterical). It was/is also somewhat groundbreaking if you think of three Hollywood actors playing drag queens. The story takes redneck bigotry and homophobia head on, but in a fun way.I'm not going to pontificate on the film's message, but if you are a redneck or a bigot, you may not like it so much. If you have an open mind, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. If you enjoy this, I can also recommend 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', and, 'Breakfast on Pluto', which go a bit further in dramatizing the issues and experiences cross-gendered people.
