    Maurizio Nichetti is known for his strange playings with reality, usually done for great comic effect. If you have the chance to see this rare film, don't hesitate. While a man may grow up to become many things, rarely do those incarnations come to exist in the same time and space, and rarely do they interact together to form a neat comedy-mystery. Nichetti must have charted this film out very carefully, and it might take a little effort on your part to keep track of exactly what's going on, but once you realize what the filmmaker is up to, you'll laugh in delight! I only wish this film was as popular and available as his other films (Volere Volare, Allegro Non Troppo, The Icicle Thief, etc.) -- and as it deserves to be!
