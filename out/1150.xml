    This review contains spoilers! Sharon Stone stars as a woman on death row, awaiting her execution, when suddenly a young lawyer decides to give it his all to fight for a stay of execution and retrial. Apparently there was exonerating evidence kept out of her trial, about her own abuse and the fact that she was drugged and drunk when she committed the heinous crime. Sharon Stone gives a brilliant performance, but the movie as a whole feels completely unnecessary, both because Dead Man Walking dealt with the same issues a few months earlier, because the mentioned circumstances doesn't really make her any less guilty or less deserving of the death penalty for having robbed two innocent people of their lives, and ultimately because all the efforts of the young lawyer yields no results, and she's ultimately executed. The latter is, along with Sharon Stone's performance, the best thing about the movie, if you ask me, but it still feels like a 103 minute long movie about nothing. An admitted killer got what she deserved, and those closest to her, and a few others who've taken it upon themselves to care, feel sad about it. Nothing new there. And certainly not enough for another movie about it...

    This movie though it is based on a tragic event and very hard to watch in parts, it shows something about the human heart which is invaluable. That is, that human beings are capable of immense compassion for other humans beings, which stems from the knowledge that we all share common bonds and deserve such compassion regardless of our life circumstances. A very touching movie to see this lawyer connect with this woman in such a way. This movie has a message well worth seeing. In addition the acting in this movie was very good and Sharon Stone did a superb job as well as Rob Marrow. I would recommend this movie for the above reasons, but be prepared for some shocking material.

    ****SPOILERS**** Tense and nail biting film about a person convicted of a double murder Cindy Liggett, Sharon Stone, waiting to be executed by the state as time as well as her life slowly ticks away form her. There's absolutely no doubt in Cindy'd crime since she freely admitted to it and is even willing to pay for it with her life. It's her clemency court appointed attorney Rick Hayes, Rob Morrow, who feels that she's getting a raw deal in being sentenced to death when there are extenuating circumstances that would have at least speared her life if made public at Cindy's murder trial. The fact that Cindy was high on crack cocaine together with her boyfriend and accomplice Doug, Don Harvey, should have at least gotten her a life sentence,in the crime not being premeditated, then a one way trip to the state's execution chamber. In fact it was Doug who got off with a life stance who's testimony sent Cindy straight to death row. Sharon Stone in a rare non glamorous role steals the show or movie as the convicted murderess Cindy Liggett who only wants to have the state end it all for her despite her lawyer Rick Hayes doing everything possible to prevent that from happening. Eevn though you know that Cindy is guilty and deserves what's coming to her, a lethal injection, Stone's acting is so electrifying in not wanting to live that you just can't help pulling for her lawyer Rick Hayes to get her off not for Sharon's or Cindy's sake but for the legal and moral augments that Rick makes in her favor! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Heart-dropping final that has everyone, even those who want Cindy to get it, rooting for Rick to get a stay of execution for Cindy even though it's hard to make a case for her not being executed. Up until the end Rick, who by then was thrown off the case, did everything in his power to save Cindy's life that it even had the pro death penalty Governor,Jack Thompson, almost on his side. And it was in the end that Rick despite his best efforts realized that Cindy was right all along in not wanting to live. And finally accepted what fate had in store for both Cindy and himself: A peace that Cindy never knew in her entire young life that in her paying for her crimes would end up giving her.

    For me personally that is always a real torture to watch type of movies,like this was,I feel myself so lucky from some reasons why I had seen a movie,without the danger of somebody wants to execute me. Sharon Stone is absolutely great in this role,and I saying this against,I'am absolutely not a fan of her acting,and movies. All the way I have to say,be careful,and think again before you see this,cause this film is enough strong to change your mood,and maybe is not for everybody. I feels like the script wants to be independent,about the question,but it is not work well all the time,but when they really wants to say they has personal opinions,that is also directly keeps distance. 7/10

    I don't know why this movie is so underrated , actually this movie i consider one of the best movies in cinema history , it has great story , amazing plot , fine cast. The scenario is great , there are no cheesy phrases , you can actually see great passion and emotion strong as true, you find yourself wrapped up in the movie and wherever Cindy goes you find yourself in Rick's chair , I think the cast also did a great job conveying a message against hate and spite. In conclusion the movie as a whole is a masterpiece with all great elements of success and thats why such a movie deserves better rating and a wider range of reputation, i totally rate it 10/10

    For people who believe in second chances. "Last Dance" belongs to my top 10 lawyer movies of all time below "A Few Good Men," "Class Action" and "The Verdict." I've seen this movie a dozen of times and as a law student I must say that it is better than your average John Grisham legal drama maybe except for "The Rainmaker." This film takes on the professional and ethical dilemma of a young clemency attorney Rick Hayes played by Rob Morrow who befriends a death row inmate convicted of double murder Cindy Liggett played by Sharon Stone. She is about to be executed. He moves heaven and earth to save her from death by lethal injection. The rest of the cast are excellent from Peter Gallagher and Jack Thompson. Randy Quaid gives a very good performance as a sarcastic veteran clemency attorney Sam Burns.

    Some criminals in death row get a dose of their own medicine while they await execution, which seems to be the case with Cindy Liggett, a woman that killed two young people a few years before. Cindy, it appears, is resigned to die. She doesn't want the idea of getting false hopes, which is what happens when a young idealistic lawyer tries to have her execution stopped because he finds flaws in her case. Unfortunately, his pleas in favor of his client go into deaf ears. Rich Hayes, a young lawyer, returns home to a job his brother John, a lawyer working in the legal system, has been able to get for him. He is assigned to the clemency department, reviewing old cases that have been tried already. The Cindy Liggett murder conviction gets his attention. It's clear, from the start, her reaction is negative. She feels she is better off dead, rather than serve life in jail. At first, Cindy clashes with Rich, but his earnestness win her over, as she begins to see some hope. Rich, for his part, steps into many toes. Worst of all, he makes a blunder by accosting the state Governor at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The Governor believes in the death sentence and is against showing clemency for a murderess like Ms. Liggett, who, as far as he is concerned, has shown no remorse in the horrible way she killed. The last moments of the film involve Cindy's preparation to die by lethal injection for the crimes she committed. It is a tense time as Rich tries to do everything possible to spare the convict of the impending death. There is a tender moment when Cindy discovers a dress Rich has bought for her to wear at her execution. Bruce Heresford has had some successes in his long film career, both in his native Australia and in America. This film will always be compared to "Dead Man Walking", a more intense, and better film. The screen play by Ron Koslow doesn't quite make us care too much for a woman who has, apparently, not an ounce of redeeming qualities. We don't believe for one moment that the young lawyer, who also hasn't done anything worth while in his life will take the convict's case to heart like he does in the film. The best thing in "Last Dance" is Sharon Stone. She obviously wanted to be taken seriously when she agreed to do this movie. Her Cindy Liggett shows a hardened soul who awakens to realize the consequences of her actions and must pay for them. Rob Morrow, who plays Rich Hays throws away the film in the way he plays the character. We don't believe him for a moment he is this man who tries so hard to have Cindy's conviction changed to life. Randy Quaid, Peter Gallagher, Jack Thompson, and Skeet Ulrich are seen in the film. The main reason to watch "Last Dance" is Sharon Stone who shows she has the potential to do better things in her movie career.

    she stars as a middle-aged woman on death row for a crime she committed as a teenager who was high on drugs and alcohol. It's really sad because back then, even she was a victim herself, of abuse by her boyfriend as well as people in her immediate family background. But two wrongs don't make a right. Her drunken and drug high resulted in the death of innocent people for which she has gotten stuck serving time while her crazy boyfriend at the time goes score free. The majority of the film is in her lawyer's point of view as he tries desperately to save her from death by lethal injection and in the process falls in love with her. It is stunningly shot though slow paced (and as well it should be, it's a film about the supposed last days of somebody's life Hello!) and brilliantly acted. The best scene is the end scene but I don't want to give too much away. Hint: it has to do with one of the most beautiful wonders of India.

    Death Row inmate Sharon Stone may be put to death by lethal injection if novice clemency lawyer Rob Morrow can't get the government to be sensitive to her case. Flimsy, one-dimensional melodrama tries taking a well-meant stand against the death penalty--but with such shallow characters, it's difficult to become involved. This was yet another bid by Stone to be taken as a serious actress, but instead she's rigid in this part, steely-eyed and dull; only in the film's final third does she shake off the cobwebs. Supporting cast (including Randy Quaid and Skeet Ulrich) is weakly-used and the writing is mediocre throughout. And what about that awful title? ** from ****

    Tough-to-watch story about a death row inmate (Stone) and the weeks before her execution. She is on death row for murders committed 10-15 years before, while under influence of alcohol, drugs, crazy boyfriend. Young hotshot lawyer (Morrow) tries to appeal, using evidence that would have cleared her, had it ever been introduced in trial. Story is actually about the struggle of love: romantic, platonic, self-esteem/love of self, love of humanity/against the death penalty. Funny thing happens to this lawyer on the way to death row...he falls in love with his client/prisoner. Is love from afar, as they never have physically intimate moments, but audience can feel the love/passion/heartbreak unfold on screen. Best performance for Stone, who believably delivers line after line of heart-wrenching, white trash, prison living drama. Not only do you feel for her, and Morrow's lawyer character, but you begin to re-examine your stance on prison and the death penalty. My heart broke, and I sobbed, when she uttered the line, "I ain't gonna beg for something I'm not gonna get." She is referring to the compassion and forgiveness her lawyer went to seek from her victims' families. You will struggle to keep it together during this movie, and will need time to emotionally recover afterwards. I cried as much as when I watched Saving Private Ryan. Both movies should be part of your permanent collection.

She is referring to the compassion and forgiveness her lawyer went to seek from her victims' families. You will struggle to keep it together during this movie, and will need time to emotionally recover afterwards. I cried as much as when I watched Saving Private Ryan. Both movies should be part of your permanent collection.
