 <sinopse>
  The story of three different men in a Louisiana prison and their eventual journey.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  DJ Zack and pimp Jack end up in prison for being too laid-back to avoid being framed for crimes they didn't commit. They end up sharing a cell with eccentric Italian optimist Roberto, whose limited command of the English language is both entertaining and infuriating -but rather more useful to them is the fact that Roberto knows an escape route

    Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is. The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave. Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape. While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

    Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee & Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances. "Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods. Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.

It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.

    Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is. The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave. Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape. While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

    Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee & Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances. "Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods. Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.

    Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is. The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave. Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape. While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

    Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee & Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances. "Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods. Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.

    Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is. The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave. Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape. While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

    Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee & Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances. "Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods. Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.

    Down By Law might just be the definitive independent, low budget art-house flick that defined the movement throughout the 80s and 90s. Folks like Soderbergh, Tarantino, Kevin Smith, and Richard Linklater owe a lot to Jarmusch's farce. The black and white photography is stoic, the acting is self assured, and the story is very bare bones, but never does the film wink or nudge at you to make the viewer notice how cool it is. The film just emanates cool, precisely because it doesn't think so highly of itself. It just wants to tell its story, and leave. Tom Waits helps a lot, but John Lurie is also solid as a pimp/hustler, both serving time in a Louisiana prison after being framed by their contemporaries. Robert Begnini comes in later, to act as a foil between the group, and eventually serves as the inspiration for their escape. While together, the three are resourceful and manage to escape the prison, it is when they separate that they are at their most vulnerable, so the film makes use of a certain sort of vague truth. But I don't think Jarmusch was as concerned with inserting any particularly deep philosophy into this film. He was just telling a simple tale, but what it lacks in intellectual furor, it makes up for in atmosphere and style. And this is one stylish piece of work. It has the structure more of a five act play, so the dialogue and characters are entertaining enough to maintain your interest even when no real action is going on. There are no heart pounding chases through the swamp, no complex escape plan, and no real tragedy. But the low budget stylistics make the film resemble more of a post-modern Marx Brothers escapade than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The soundtrack says it all, really. Slow beat, jazzy, and cool baby, real cool. If all else, see this movie for one of, if not the, first U.S. performance by Robert Begnini. Before he replaced Peter Sellers in "The Son of Pink Panther", he was a great character actor. For this, Jarmusch should also be commended.

    Ever since "Stranger than Paradise," I have loved and sought out quirky filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. He has an unusual sense of humor and an unusual way of presenting his films. Sometimes they're episodic, like Coffee & Cigarettes, Mystery Train, and Night on Earth, and sometimes they tell the story of bizarre people brought together by bizarre circumstances. "Down by Law" is about three men who meet in a New Orleans prison, Zack, Jack, and Roberto (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni). Zack is a DJ who took $1000 to drive a car, but there was a body in the trunk. Jack is a pimp sent out to check out a new prospect who turns out to be underage, and the police are waiting. We only hear Roberto's story from his lips - he apparently threw a billiard ball at someone and the person died. The three men manage to escape into a swamp and woods. Roberto quotes (in Italian) the man he refers to as "Bob Frost" and there is the symbol in the film of "The Road Not Taken" when a fork in the road is reached. One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

One thing that cracked me up was the same thing that cracked me up in "Stranger than Paradise" - in that film, everywhere the characters went looked exactly the same as the crummy neighborhood and weather they left in Chicago. It didn't matter if it was in Florida or at the aunt's house - it was always overcast and awful. Here, the three men escape and wind up in a building to spend the night that looks just like their prison cell. Benigni, as the cheerful, chatty one is hilarious, and what happens to him is even funnier - and could only have happened to that character. Waits and Lurie give solid performances in less showy roles - another element of Jarmusch is his unusual casting. "Down by Law" is done in stark black and white; rarely does Jarmusch work in color. It gives this film a downbeat atmosphere, along with the garbage in the neighborhood streets, the swamp, and the woods. There are slow sections but if you want to see this unique director's work, I recommend it. No one tells a story, or chooses what story to tell, quite like he does.

    I don't understand . I don't understand why some really great and really funny movies are rated by IMDb voters below 7.0 , while such unfunny piece of s*** gets a high rating. I really don't know. Before you throw tomatoes at me , please hear me out. I consider myself a guy with sense of humor. I like different kinds of comedy . I like Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd , Benny Hill , Eddie Murphy , Rodney Dangerfield , Chevy Chase , Monty Python , Police academy , Wes Anderson movies ,Billy Wilder movies, some black comedy , cartoons and many others . I've seen only one Jarmusch movie before this one ("Broken flowers") and I liked it . I was expecting something good from this one too. Especially considering the praise I've heard from many people. This ? This is BORING . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING . I don't remember when was the last time I saw something so lifeless . Not to mention I fail to see where the jokes are . Really. I've seen this twice and I honestly haven't found a single funny thing . I regret that Jarmusch didn't put the fake laughs (just like in those American sitcoms)into the movie , so I would at least know what he thought was a good joke . And why this is black and white ? What's the point ? "Raging bull" and "Sin city" are black and white for reason. Here ? I don't know . Maybe so Jarmusch could pretend this is some "artistic" movie. Maybe he did this movie to show what a rebel he is. I liked Tom Waits songs . I also have to admit that acting is solid. The characters are likable. It doesn't change the fact that it's a completely pointless movie . Watch it only if you're insomniac. I give it 2/10.

    I recently saw a 35mm print of "Down By Law" for the first time and really had no idea what to expect but as an admirer of independent film I was curious. Needless to say "Down By Law" almost single-handedly defines independent cinema with its seedy characters and willingness to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. Zack (Tom Waits) is a disc jockey who can't seem to keep a job and spends most of his time in an alcohol induced stupor. Ellen Barkin is memorable in a small role as Zack's long-suffering girlfriend. It's sad Barkin didn't get more opportunities in her film career. Jack (John Lurie) is a pimp who's fond of saying that he knows how to treat his girls and in one scene Jarmusch gives us a prolonged shot of Jack as seen from the perspective of a naked, outstretched prostitute. Obviously neither of these two ne'er do wells is destined to amount to much of anything so as fate would have it they end up sharing a prison cell where they argue incessantly. When an Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni) joins the two they learn that he too is a victim of bizarre circumstances. Benigni does a great job and practically owns the film from that point on. It's a great comedy performance. After this it's easy to see Benigni scaling the seats at the 1998 Oscars after winning for "Life Is Beautiful". Eventually there's an escape and the 3 convicts must dodge police trackers through the Louisiana bayou. Robby Muller's black and white camera-work adroitly creates a dark, surreal atmosphere. The Tom Waits songs are great and he and John Lurie play off each other beautifully. This is a great little work of cinema art by Jim Jarmusch. A must-see.

    From director Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), this film featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die sounded like a different kind of film from the director commonly known for his darker dramas and comedies, and it was film I looked forward to. Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a "clean" car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to "work for him" but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy. Very good!

    During the setup, I wasn't sure what this was about. We see Tom Waits and John Lurie each get set up, framed, and sent to jail. Each has a girl friend who is inessential to the story and disappears after these introductions, but they comment on these men and their lives. The men and their women are living in rundown areas and on the fringe. The movie does a great job photographically of immersing us in these poor areas and giving them a beauty all their own. And it is also as if to say that all the people we are seeing are human beings too and part of the world's stage, as well as all fools too as mortals be. Waits is a disc jockey who loses one job after another because he's independent. Lurie is a pimp. In jail they are joined by an Italian still learning the language, played very comically by Roberto Benigni. In fact, it is at that point that the comic element comes to the fore, as we see how these three men living in one cell interact with one another. And that becomes largely what this part of the movie is about. It's fairly unpredictable and amusing. Some of it may have been improvised. Although there are frictions, the men bond with one another, but not too much. Their circumstances influence how they behave toward one another. Although Benigni is slighter of build than his cell mates, can't speak English well, and seems a clown, his character continually brings us some surprises as the story develops. This adds to the fun. The three men escape jail, and the rest of the story follows them through the chase, the swamps of Lousiana and what refuges they can find. The comic element fades away to a large extent and the movie's tone becomes simply wry and ironic. An interesting moral situation occurs when, during the pursuit, Benigni cannot swim and the others must decide whether or not to save their own skins or risk losing them by helping Benigni. They are in an existential plight. The whole movie has this existential tone to it. The men do not philosophize. They don't ruminate much about the situations they find themselves in. They don't cooperate all that much. They don't for the most part exhibit much skill in the wilderness, yet they manage to make their way. Their leadership seems always to shift. It's an anarchic set of relations. They create their own humor and laughter, their own kind of poetry, even their own jail window. We see that men need art, poetry, laughter, friendship. They also need women, and this too is shown. They need on occasion to fight. These men living on the fringe that most of us will never meet show us some basic things about human life. This is a large virtue of this movie. The men behave naturally. With all of society's conventions, we need to be reminded that men have natures and behave naturally. This is a very good movie.

    Jarmusch makes films about people. This is, to my taste, his best film. If you like people and you like watching people, you will enjoy this film. Jarmusch shows us some strange but interesting people, and these characters are delightfully strange and interesting -- but, importantly, these people are believable and accessible. These people are of the kind ground down by the world and their own poor choices. For a moment, a wonderful moment we witness, they are given a new lease on life and new hope for a better time, a better life. How do they deal with this grind of the world? With anger, ennui, humor and hope. Together, the cast is perfect. Perfectly cast, perfectly expressive, perfectly reactive to the world they inhabit. No fantastic chase scenes, no over-the-top explosions or CGI, no overdone melodrama. Perfectly tuned actors playing subtle notes. Like "The Remains of the Day" this film can quietly move you. Unlike that film, this one can finally lift you up as well. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully scored with just the right music, wonderfully filmed in black and white, this is an excellent movie of any kind. Of its own particular type, it is superb.

    Jim Jarmush once again flaunts his intelligence, eye for detail, and love of poetry in his quietly brilliant film, Down by Law. It's a film about three men with very different stories who all find themselves in the same cell in a New Orleans prison. Tom Waits plays Zack, a lowly radio DJ with no future. John Lurie is Jack, a wannabe pimp who doesn't really have a clue what he is doing but pretends like he does. And then there is Roberto Benigni as Roberto, an Italian tourist who is desperate to learn about American culture and language, but has come to the wrong part of town to find it. Together, these three oddball characters escape from prison and go on a weird and offbeat, existential journey through the New Orleans swamp land. On the surface Down by Law seems like little to nothing. But it is the quiet subtleties that make this a rather ingenious film. On the surface it is a story of three strange men who escape from prison together. But Jarmush mixes in his witty dialect, astute characterization, and clever allusions to poetry that carry throughout the film to make it more than just a prison escape film. He disguises a sophisticated ingenuity about the film underneath simple quirkiness. He plays up a lively and rather simplistic nuance, only to sprinkle the film with a more intelligent air. The film really does feel like a smart film, whether you can place where the intelligence comes from or not. However, that's not to say that this film isn't fun, as well as funny. Zack, Jack, and Roberto are three great characters and they work so well together. They all have their odd quirks and strange mannerisms that make them all very unique people. There is some great banter between the three and plenty of moments that aren't necessarily laugh out loud hysterical, but pleasantly funny, eliciting a chuckle of approval. And then of course the unique way Jarmush shoots the film also makes it a very interesting watch for those with a keen eye for unique directorial ability. Down by Law is an effective exercise in intelligent shot framing as Jarmush shoots the entire film with very long still shots, or very long shots that make only subtle movements, making the direction of this film silently brilliant. Add to that the skillful black and white cinematography and it is safe to call this film a subtly excellent visual experience. Jim Jarmush almost always impresses us with his great usage of minimalist filmmaking techniques. He creates such unique stories that all have such quiet excellence that they become remarkably unforgettable films, even if you don't pick up on their brilliance the first one or two viewings. Down by Law may be one of his quietest exaltations of skillful minimalist filmmaking, but it is still an excellent film. Jarmush tells his story exactly how he wants to tell it, and he gives us, the audience, a unique experience to remember.

    I watched this film again last night having originally seen it when it came out and again a few times over the years. I still love it and find it endlessly fascinating. One of the other reviews suggests that the first half hour is not very exciting. It may not set my pulse racing but I love the way it slowly engages me. The photography and the sound track and pace all really set up a sense of place and a mood that enables me to understand the characters and their background. Once the three main characters are bought together it seems to me that this provides an good example of three classic archetypes of modern maleness. There is something in all of the characters that struggles for expression. The Roberto Benigni character (Bob) although the least cool is the only one at peace with himself. I often hear women comment that they don't understand men, well watching this film may help. Overall it is one of my favourite films and I could watch it over and over again and still get something new from it. If you like quiet thoughtful character based pieces, this is for you. MT.
