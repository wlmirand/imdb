    Alien is a very well-written film about a space marine group that come across an evil alien that slowly picks off the members of the crew, one by one. Eventually, only one member, Rilpey, is left. The moments leading up to the moment when Ripley is caught by the alien are very, very scary and the movie provides major shocks as well. Also, the 'chest buster' scene is very gory, when an alien bursts out of a man's chest. The special effects overall are very good, and the scares and entertainment factor makes this a very good film. The sequel, 'Aliens', was even better, but this is definitely worth watching. 'Alien 3' was not very good, but it was still OK, and the ending was very good and sad. I have not seen any other films in the series, but I plan to. Overall, Alien was very scary,very shocking and great start to the Alien series.

    It's been about 5 years since the first time I ever watched Alien. Can't believe I've waited so long to revisit it! I appreciated the film much more this time around and there are just so many aspects that make it such an amazing breed of horror with science fiction. The visual effects still look gorgeous and quite realistic. You really feel like you are in space on this epic journey. Another thing that works remarkably well is the suspense. Wow, this film truly delivers a lot of clever and effective thrills! Some may argue that it can get a little slow at times, but that's precisely why it's so brilliant for me. Director Ridley Scott keeps making you wonder when and how the Alien will appear again, constantly building this claustrophobic and suspenseful atmosphere, which will remain present until the very end. Another interesting aspect is that this journey gets a surprising turn of events, involving one of the crew members. As a result, there's also tension within the group. All the cast involved did a terrific work and there are some very iconic characters here. Alien is my personal favorite from Ridley Scott and also one of the finest sci-fi / horror films ever made.

    Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.

    The most classic suspense-horror of all was one of the most intense movies I could've seen at a young age. A crew on the ship Nostromo get a distress call from a lone planet and respond by investigating. While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4

    One of the most original, suspenseful, & frightening films you'll ever see, Alien is Ridley Scott's breakthrough film and a masterful blend of horror & science-fiction which today is widely & rightly regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A triumph of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score and a unique style of narration that fuses the silence of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with sudden terror of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Alien continues to be one of the landmarks & most influential films in both science-fiction & modern horror. Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from the very first frame. The plot follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board the huge commercial ship, named Nostromo. When they're interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate but ends up discovering a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so begins the horrorÂ… the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which itself is a brilliant & original fusion of insect, man & machine and the crew's struggle to survive in the face of an unknown danger that starts stalking & killing them one by one. Ridley Scott's direction & Dan O'Bannon's script is equally amazing & clever. O'Bannon's vision of the monster itself and the futuristic world he set the plot in truly deserves a bow. Ridley Scott's atmospheric visuals, breathtaking details & emphasis on realism over movie heroics provides Alien an ageless appeal. The art direction, set designs & visual effects also contribute a lot to make the film more realistic & plausible by giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the time-line this film is set in. Cinematography & editing is done amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film to give us an end product that's near perfect, technically, in almost all departments of filmmaking. The cast worked brilliantly together as a team and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance. Plus, their mature effort on-screen helped this film a lot, as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing characters. All the characters are very nicely written too as we grow to care for each one of them and their very fear becomes our own as the movie progresses. With a cast comprising of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, the one who impresses the most is the youngest cast member, Sigourney Weaver playing the character of Ellen Ripley. Weaver plays Ripley as a bold, strong woman doing everything it takes to survive instead of trying to be a hero and does a terrific job. Rest of the cast also chipped in with vital contributions and overall, the acting department carries no complaints. But the most distinct thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing which separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time and waits until the viewers are completely immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening, as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild. The suspense is further elevated by the accompanying silence, and Jerry Goldsmith's tense score turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario. Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. Overall, as writer David McIntee said, "Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies" and he is right. The most crucial thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the effect of what you think you saw and that's where Alien is at its scariest. Be it the fans who love horror, science-fiction, gore & violence or even strong female characters, Alien has something in store for every cinema lover out there and just like it has influenced modern science-fiction & horror since its inception, will continue to do so for years to come. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic and a marvelous combination of art, science & horror, Ridley Scott's Alien is Strongly Recommended.

    At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home. Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!

    Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.

    When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created. So, I am listing this as one of the "Revolutionary Films" of my lifetime.

    This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well renderedâ€‹â€‹. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie ! (sorry for the expression, I'm french)

    You can see more reviews at www.beessquaredbookbuzz.blogspot.com June 9, 2013 I'll probably get a lot of flack from this review and rating of Alien. Why do I say this? Well, because this is like one of the most critically acclaimed and one of the greatest movies of all time and to be blunt I thought it was really boring. I understood how it's a groundbreaking movie for the time what with the special effects, premise, and such but I still thought it was slow. Don't get me wrong, I liked some parts but on the whole I was surprised I didn't fall asleep. Even though I wasn't that impressed with Alien, I'll think I'll get around to watching the sequels. Hey, they can only get better, right? Well, we'll see. Buzz ya later, Beans

Don't get me wrong, I liked some parts but on the whole I was surprised I didn't fall asleep. Even though I wasn't that impressed with Alien, I'll think I'll get around to watching the sequels. Hey, they can only get better, right? Well, we'll see. Buzz ya later, Beans

    Alien is a very well-written film about a space marine group that come across an evil alien that slowly picks off the members of the crew, one by one. Eventually, only one member, Rilpey, is left. The moments leading up to the moment when Ripley is caught by the alien are very, very scary and the movie provides major shocks as well. Also, the 'chest buster' scene is very gory, when an alien bursts out of a man's chest. The special effects overall are very good, and the scares and entertainment factor makes this a very good film. The sequel, 'Aliens', was even better, but this is definitely worth watching. 'Alien 3' was not very good, but it was still OK, and the ending was very good and sad. I have not seen any other films in the series, but I plan to. Overall, Alien was very scary,very shocking and great start to the Alien series.

    It's been about 5 years since the first time I ever watched Alien. Can't believe I've waited so long to revisit it! I appreciated the film much more this time around and there are just so many aspects that make it such an amazing breed of horror with science fiction. The visual effects still look gorgeous and quite realistic. You really feel like you are in space on this epic journey. Another thing that works remarkably well is the suspense. Wow, this film truly delivers a lot of clever and effective thrills! Some may argue that it can get a little slow at times, but that's precisely why it's so brilliant for me. Director Ridley Scott keeps making you wonder when and how the Alien will appear again, constantly building this claustrophobic and suspenseful atmosphere, which will remain present until the very end. Another interesting aspect is that this journey gets a surprising turn of events, involving one of the crew members. As a result, there's also tension within the group. All the cast involved did a terrific work and there are some very iconic characters here. Alien is my personal favorite from Ridley Scott and also one of the finest sci-fi / horror films ever made.

    Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.

    The most classic suspense-horror of all was one of the most intense movies I could've seen at a young age. A crew on the ship Nostromo get a distress call from a lone planet and respond by investigating. While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4

    One of the most original, suspenseful, & frightening films you'll ever see, Alien is Ridley Scott's breakthrough film and a masterful blend of horror & science-fiction which today is widely & rightly regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A triumph of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score and a unique style of narration that fuses the silence of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with sudden terror of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Alien continues to be one of the landmarks & most influential films in both science-fiction & modern horror. Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from the very first frame. The plot follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board the huge commercial ship, named Nostromo. When they're interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate but ends up discovering a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so begins the horrorÂ… the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which itself is a brilliant & original fusion of insect, man & machine and the crew's struggle to survive in the face of an unknown danger that starts stalking & killing them one by one. Ridley Scott's direction & Dan O'Bannon's script is equally amazing & clever. O'Bannon's vision of the monster itself and the futuristic world he set the plot in truly deserves a bow. Ridley Scott's atmospheric visuals, breathtaking details & emphasis on realism over movie heroics provides Alien an ageless appeal. The art direction, set designs & visual effects also contribute a lot to make the film more realistic & plausible by giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the time-line this film is set in. Cinematography & editing is done amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film to give us an end product that's near perfect, technically, in almost all departments of filmmaking. The cast worked brilliantly together as a team and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance. Plus, their mature effort on-screen helped this film a lot, as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing characters. All the characters are very nicely written too as we grow to care for each one of them and their very fear becomes our own as the movie progresses. With a cast comprising of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, the one who impresses the most is the youngest cast member, Sigourney Weaver playing the character of Ellen Ripley. Weaver plays Ripley as a bold, strong woman doing everything it takes to survive instead of trying to be a hero and does a terrific job. Rest of the cast also chipped in with vital contributions and overall, the acting department carries no complaints. But the most distinct thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing which separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time and waits until the viewers are completely immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening, as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild. The suspense is further elevated by the accompanying silence, and Jerry Goldsmith's tense score turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario. Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. Overall, as writer David McIntee said, "Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies" and he is right. The most crucial thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the effect of what you think you saw and that's where Alien is at its scariest. Be it the fans who love horror, science-fiction, gore & violence or even strong female characters, Alien has something in store for every cinema lover out there and just like it has influenced modern science-fiction & horror since its inception, will continue to do so for years to come. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic and a marvelous combination of art, science & horror, Ridley Scott's Alien is Strongly Recommended.

    At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home. Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!

    Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.

    When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created. So, I am listing this as one of the "Revolutionary Films" of my lifetime.

    This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well renderedâ€‹â€‹. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie ! (sorry for the expression, I'm french)

    It's been about 5 years since the first time I ever watched Alien. Can't believe I've waited so long to revisit it! I appreciated the film much more this time around and there are just so many aspects that make it such an amazing breed of horror with science fiction. The visual effects still look gorgeous and quite realistic. You really feel like you are in space on this epic journey. Another thing that works remarkably well is the suspense. Wow, this film truly delivers a lot of clever and effective thrills! Some may argue that it can get a little slow at times, but that's precisely why it's so brilliant for me. Director Ridley Scott keeps making you wonder when and how the Alien will appear again, constantly building this claustrophobic and suspenseful atmosphere, which will remain present until the very end. Another interesting aspect is that this journey gets a surprising turn of events, involving one of the crew members. As a result, there's also tension within the group. All the cast involved did a terrific work and there are some very iconic characters here. Alien is my personal favorite from Ridley Scott and also one of the finest sci-fi / horror films ever made.

    Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.

    The most classic suspense-horror of all was one of the most intense movies I could've seen at a young age. A crew on the ship Nostromo get a distress call from a lone planet and respond by investigating. While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4

    One of the most original, suspenseful, & frightening films you'll ever see, Alien is Ridley Scott's breakthrough film and a masterful blend of horror & science-fiction which today is widely & rightly regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A triumph of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score and a unique style of narration that fuses the silence of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with sudden terror of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Alien continues to be one of the landmarks & most influential films in both science-fiction & modern horror. Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from the very first frame. The plot follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board the huge commercial ship, named Nostromo. When they're interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate but ends up discovering a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so begins the horrorÂ… the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which itself is a brilliant & original fusion of insect, man & machine and the crew's struggle to survive in the face of an unknown danger that starts stalking & killing them one by one. Ridley Scott's direction & Dan O'Bannon's script is equally amazing & clever. O'Bannon's vision of the monster itself and the futuristic world he set the plot in truly deserves a bow. Ridley Scott's atmospheric visuals, breathtaking details & emphasis on realism over movie heroics provides Alien an ageless appeal. The art direction, set designs & visual effects also contribute a lot to make the film more realistic & plausible by giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the time-line this film is set in. Cinematography & editing is done amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film to give us an end product that's near perfect, technically, in almost all departments of filmmaking. The cast worked brilliantly together as a team and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance. Plus, their mature effort on-screen helped this film a lot, as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing characters. All the characters are very nicely written too as we grow to care for each one of them and their very fear becomes our own as the movie progresses. With a cast comprising of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, the one who impresses the most is the youngest cast member, Sigourney Weaver playing the character of Ellen Ripley. Weaver plays Ripley as a bold, strong woman doing everything it takes to survive instead of trying to be a hero and does a terrific job. Rest of the cast also chipped in with vital contributions and overall, the acting department carries no complaints. But the most distinct thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing which separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time and waits until the viewers are completely immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening, as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild. The suspense is further elevated by the accompanying silence, and Jerry Goldsmith's tense score turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario. Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. Overall, as writer David McIntee said, "Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies" and he is right. The most crucial thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the effect of what you think you saw and that's where Alien is at its scariest. Be it the fans who love horror, science-fiction, gore & violence or even strong female characters, Alien has something in store for every cinema lover out there and just like it has influenced modern science-fiction & horror since its inception, will continue to do so for years to come. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic and a marvelous combination of art, science & horror, Ridley Scott's Alien is Strongly Recommended.

    At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home. Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!

    Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.

    When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created. So, I am listing this as one of the "Revolutionary Films" of my lifetime.

    This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well renderedâ€‹â€‹. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie ! (sorry for the expression, I'm french)

    You can see more reviews at www.beessquaredbookbuzz.blogspot.com June 9, 2013 I'll probably get a lot of flack from this review and rating of Alien. Why do I say this? Well, because this is like one of the most critically acclaimed and one of the greatest movies of all time and to be blunt I thought it was really boring. I understood how it's a groundbreaking movie for the time what with the special effects, premise, and such but I still thought it was slow. Don't get me wrong, I liked some parts but on the whole I was surprised I didn't fall asleep. Even though I wasn't that impressed with Alien, I'll think I'll get around to watching the sequels. Hey, they can only get better, right? Well, we'll see. Buzz ya later, Beans

    Alien is a very well-written film about a space marine group that come across an evil alien that slowly picks off the members of the crew, one by one. Eventually, only one member, Rilpey, is left. The moments leading up to the moment when Ripley is caught by the alien are very, very scary and the movie provides major shocks as well. Also, the 'chest buster' scene is very gory, when an alien bursts out of a man's chest. The special effects overall are very good, and the scares and entertainment factor makes this a very good film. The sequel, 'Aliens', was even better, but this is definitely worth watching. 'Alien 3' was not very good, but it was still OK, and the ending was very good and sad. I have not seen any other films in the series, but I plan to. Overall, Alien was very scary,very shocking and great start to the Alien series.

    Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.

    The most classic suspense-horror of all was one of the most intense movies I could've seen at a young age. A crew on the ship Nostromo get a distress call from a lone planet and respond by investigating. While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4

    One of the most original, suspenseful, & frightening films you'll ever see, Alien is Ridley Scott's breakthrough film and a masterful blend of horror & science-fiction which today is widely & rightly regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A triumph of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score and a unique style of narration that fuses the silence of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with sudden terror of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Alien continues to be one of the landmarks & most influential films in both science-fiction & modern horror. Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from the very first frame. The plot follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board the huge commercial ship, named Nostromo. When they're interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate but ends up discovering a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so begins the horrorÂ… the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which itself is a brilliant & original fusion of insect, man & machine and the crew's struggle to survive in the face of an unknown danger that starts stalking & killing them one by one. Ridley Scott's direction & Dan O'Bannon's script is equally amazing & clever. O'Bannon's vision of the monster itself and the futuristic world he set the plot in truly deserves a bow. Ridley Scott's atmospheric visuals, breathtaking details & emphasis on realism over movie heroics provides Alien an ageless appeal. The art direction, set designs & visual effects also contribute a lot to make the film more realistic & plausible by giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the time-line this film is set in. Cinematography & editing is done amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film to give us an end product that's near perfect, technically, in almost all departments of filmmaking. The cast worked brilliantly together as a team and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance. Plus, their mature effort on-screen helped this film a lot, as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing characters. All the characters are very nicely written too as we grow to care for each one of them and their very fear becomes our own as the movie progresses. With a cast comprising of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, the one who impresses the most is the youngest cast member, Sigourney Weaver playing the character of Ellen Ripley. Weaver plays Ripley as a bold, strong woman doing everything it takes to survive instead of trying to be a hero and does a terrific job. Rest of the cast also chipped in with vital contributions and overall, the acting department carries no complaints. But the most distinct thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing which separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time and waits until the viewers are completely immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening, as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild. The suspense is further elevated by the accompanying silence, and Jerry Goldsmith's tense score turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario. Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. Overall, as writer David McIntee said, "Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies" and he is right. The most crucial thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the effect of what you think you saw and that's where Alien is at its scariest. Be it the fans who love horror, science-fiction, gore & violence or even strong female characters, Alien has something in store for every cinema lover out there and just like it has influenced modern science-fiction & horror since its inception, will continue to do so for years to come. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic and a marvelous combination of art, science & horror, Ridley Scott's Alien is Strongly Recommended.

    At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home. Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!

    Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.

    When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created. So, I am listing this as one of the "Revolutionary Films" of my lifetime.

    This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well renderedâ€‹â€‹. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie ! (sorry for the expression, I'm french)

    You can see more reviews at www.beessquaredbookbuzz.blogspot.com June 9, 2013 I'll probably get a lot of flack from this review and rating of Alien. Why do I say this? Well, because this is like one of the most critically acclaimed and one of the greatest movies of all time and to be blunt I thought it was really boring. I understood how it's a groundbreaking movie for the time what with the special effects, premise, and such but I still thought it was slow. Don't get me wrong, I liked some parts but on the whole I was surprised I didn't fall asleep. Even though I wasn't that impressed with Alien, I'll think I'll get around to watching the sequels. Hey, they can only get better, right? Well, we'll see. Buzz ya later, Beans

    Alien is a very well-written film about a space marine group that come across an evil alien that slowly picks off the members of the crew, one by one. Eventually, only one member, Rilpey, is left. The moments leading up to the moment when Ripley is caught by the alien are very, very scary and the movie provides major shocks as well. Also, the 'chest buster' scene is very gory, when an alien bursts out of a man's chest. The special effects overall are very good, and the scares and entertainment factor makes this a very good film. The sequel, 'Aliens', was even better, but this is definitely worth watching. 'Alien 3' was not very good, but it was still OK, and the ending was very good and sad. I have not seen any other films in the series, but I plan to. Overall, Alien was very scary,very shocking and great start to the Alien series.

    It's been about 5 years since the first time I ever watched Alien. Can't believe I've waited so long to revisit it! I appreciated the film much more this time around and there are just so many aspects that make it such an amazing breed of horror with science fiction. The visual effects still look gorgeous and quite realistic. You really feel like you are in space on this epic journey. Another thing that works remarkably well is the suspense. Wow, this film truly delivers a lot of clever and effective thrills! Some may argue that it can get a little slow at times, but that's precisely why it's so brilliant for me. Director Ridley Scott keeps making you wonder when and how the Alien will appear again, constantly building this claustrophobic and suspenseful atmosphere, which will remain present until the very end. Another interesting aspect is that this journey gets a surprising turn of events, involving one of the crew members. As a result, there's also tension within the group. All the cast involved did a terrific work and there are some very iconic characters here. Alien is my personal favorite from Ridley Scott and also one of the finest sci-fi / horror films ever made.

The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts. It shows no mercy and puts some ofthe most ordinary characters in the most difficult situation against the worst foe. Ridley Scott's first masterpiece, and one of my favorites, this movie is the birth of true space horror. 4*/4

    One of the most original, suspenseful, & frightening films you'll ever see, Alien is Ridley Scott's breakthrough film and a masterful blend of horror & science-fiction which today is widely & rightly regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A triumph of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score and a unique style of narration that fuses the silence of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with sudden terror of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Alien continues to be one of the landmarks & most influential films in both science-fiction & modern horror. Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from the very first frame. The plot follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board the huge commercial ship, named Nostromo. When they're interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate but ends up discovering a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so begins the horrorÂ… the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which itself is a brilliant & original fusion of insect, man & machine and the crew's struggle to survive in the face of an unknown danger that starts stalking & killing them one by one. Ridley Scott's direction & Dan O'Bannon's script is equally amazing & clever. O'Bannon's vision of the monster itself and the futuristic world he set the plot in truly deserves a bow. Ridley Scott's atmospheric visuals, breathtaking details & emphasis on realism over movie heroics provides Alien an ageless appeal. The art direction, set designs & visual effects also contribute a lot to make the film more realistic & plausible by giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the time-line this film is set in. Cinematography & editing is done amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film to give us an end product that's near perfect, technically, in almost all departments of filmmaking. The cast worked brilliantly together as a team and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance. Plus, their mature effort on-screen helped this film a lot, as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing characters. All the characters are very nicely written too as we grow to care for each one of them and their very fear becomes our own as the movie progresses. With a cast comprising of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, the one who impresses the most is the youngest cast member, Sigourney Weaver playing the character of Ellen Ripley. Weaver plays Ripley as a bold, strong woman doing everything it takes to survive instead of trying to be a hero and does a terrific job. Rest of the cast also chipped in with vital contributions and overall, the acting department carries no complaints. But the most distinct thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing which separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time and waits until the viewers are completely immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening, as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild. The suspense is further elevated by the accompanying silence, and Jerry Goldsmith's tense score turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario. Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. Overall, as writer David McIntee said, "Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies" and he is right. The most crucial thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the effect of what you think you saw and that's where Alien is at its scariest. Be it the fans who love horror, science-fiction, gore & violence or even strong female characters, Alien has something in store for every cinema lover out there and just like it has influenced modern science-fiction & horror since its inception, will continue to do so for years to come. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic and a marvelous combination of art, science & horror, Ridley Scott's Alien is Strongly Recommended.

    At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home. Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!

    Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.

    When I tell younger people about movies that were revolutionary, like 'Jaws, Star Wars & Alien,' it is hard for them to comprehend just how incredible these motion pictures were. Back then, pretty much everyone watched the same pictures that were produced, because we didn't have anything close to the voluminous productions that seem to churn out weekly in 2013. When I watch most older films, I have to use my imagination more (like watching a play in a theater), but this seems to be harder for our children to do, because they are hand-fed stimulating, very realistic looking, HD graphics now. Alien scared the crap out of us in new ways, without the use of computer enhancements. It used camera angles, lighting, and modeling to a novel degree. The writing was also fresh, with an ominous monster like never before created. So, I am listing this as one of the "Revolutionary Films" of my lifetime.

    This movie is really excellent and haven't too aged despite its age. The rise of anxiety is progressive, but totally mastered. The scenario is not very profound but it's okay. Letting some unanswered questions helps to deepen the fear of an unknown enemy. Each appearance of the Alien is both terrifying and beautiful. The music accentuates the fear. Sigourney Weaver, aka Ripley, is perfect in his role. Some moment are quite gory, but there are not many. The atmosphere claustrophobic in the middle of the space is well renderedâ€‹â€‹. The sets of the ship are in total agreement with the atmosphere of the movie. The suspense never released, until the final unexpected. A great movie ! (sorry for the expression, I'm french)

    You can see more reviews at www.beessquaredbookbuzz.blogspot.com June 9, 2013 I'll probably get a lot of flack from this review and rating of Alien. Why do I say this? Well, because this is like one of the most critically acclaimed and one of the greatest movies of all time and to be blunt I thought it was really boring. I understood how it's a groundbreaking movie for the time what with the special effects, premise, and such but I still thought it was slow. Don't get me wrong, I liked some parts but on the whole I was surprised I didn't fall asleep. Even though I wasn't that impressed with Alien, I'll think I'll get around to watching the sequels. Hey, they can only get better, right? Well, we'll see. Buzz ya later, Beans

    Alien is a very well-written film about a space marine group that come across an evil alien that slowly picks off the members of the crew, one by one. Eventually, only one member, Rilpey, is left. The moments leading up to the moment when Ripley is caught by the alien are very, very scary and the movie provides major shocks as well. Also, the 'chest buster' scene is very gory, when an alien bursts out of a man's chest. The special effects overall are very good, and the scares and entertainment factor makes this a very good film. The sequel, 'Aliens', was even better, but this is definitely worth watching. 'Alien 3' was not very good, but it was still OK, and the ending was very good and sad. I have not seen any other films in the series, but I plan to. Overall, Alien was very scary,very shocking and great start to the Alien series.

    It's been about 5 years since the first time I ever watched Alien. Can't believe I've waited so long to revisit it! I appreciated the film much more this time around and there are just so many aspects that make it such an amazing breed of horror with science fiction. The visual effects still look gorgeous and quite realistic. You really feel like you are in space on this epic journey. Another thing that works remarkably well is the suspense. Wow, this film truly delivers a lot of clever and effective thrills! Some may argue that it can get a little slow at times, but that's precisely why it's so brilliant for me. Director Ridley Scott keeps making you wonder when and how the Alien will appear again, constantly building this claustrophobic and suspenseful atmosphere, which will remain present until the very end. Another interesting aspect is that this journey gets a surprising turn of events, involving one of the crew members. As a result, there's also tension within the group. All the cast involved did a terrific work and there are some very iconic characters here. Alien is my personal favorite from Ridley Scott and also one of the finest sci-fi / horror films ever made.

    Alien is a brilliant movie with a really well developed,clever and unique storyline,a very inspired cast and outstanding effects,especially for a movie that was made in 1979.The movie is considered both a horror and a sci-fi,and although the actual alien is very frightening,there aren't any scenes that I thought really jumped out and frightened me,but I did really like the idea of a sci-fi that is much darker and grittier than usual.This movie is what made both Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott famous,and they both continue to star and direct very impressive films.If your a horror fan,I wouldn't really recommend Alien,but I would highly recommend it to all fans of sci-fi. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow spaceship crew must fight off a deadly alien stowaway.

    The most classic suspense-horror of all was one of the most intense movies I could've seen at a young age. A crew on the ship Nostromo get a distress call from a lone planet and respond by investigating. While searching the ship, one of the crew members is attacked by a parasite life-form that attach's to the hosts face. He is later brought back by his shipmates and recovers, successfully removing the parasite from his body.... or so they thought. The movie has great suspense and with none of the cheesyhorror music to ruin the best parts.
