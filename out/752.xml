    The beginning had the gritty Miami Vice (2006) look and beat of director Michael Mann. Antoine Fuqua in his first directorial job and known for his subsequent hit Training Day (2001) and more recently Olympus Has Fallen (2013) did reasonable well. The plot was understandable if not original and his attempts at humanizing the characters and time spent was reflective of his future efforts. Surprising its the main character as a hit man played by Yun-Fat Chow that's a letdown. His scripted behavior as a hit-man doesn't have the finesse or the dazzling exploitation of martial arts that other action movies has shown to retain a high level of interest. Other preferable viewing options would be Matt Damon's Bourne Identity (2002) set a high bar for cool-headed and engaging assassination work. Shadowboxer (2005), Wild Target (2009), Leon: The Professional (1994), Enemy of the State (1998), Elektra (2005), The Air I Breathe (2007), Pulp Fiction (1994).

    This shockingly dull actioner stars Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man who refuses to carry out a contract on a cop's son and then scarpers to avoid retribution from his boss. Blazing a trail of rotten ideas across the screen, the screenplay saves most of its atrocious dialogue for Mira Sorvino, who tearfully pushes her Oscar to the back of her broom closet in order to play a forger caught up in the whole sorry mess. Antoine Fuqua batters us into submission with his frenetic direction and throws in more slow motion shots than John Woo would find acceptable, none of the cast bothers to act, and Michael Rooker's doormat beard is irritating. Some of the music's not bad, and that's the film's only tolerable element.

    First time Director Fuqua will go on to make better Movies, much better. Chow-Yun Fat has made Movies, with John Woo, that are Classics. But here is a frustrating attempt to bring Chow to American Audiences and it fails on almost every level. There are more bullets than words in this shallow and derivative Script. The Actors are solely determined and the Movie looks great. The problem is that there are a numbing number of Gunfights that consist of not much more that the firing of Guns with little or no Style. Two fine and engaging Stars and a Director with a future are the only reasons to give this a view, or maybe if you like the sound of steel on steel and the firing of automatic weapons. But be warned, this may put you off the better Movies of the Genre and that includes just about all of them.

    A deadly Chinese assassin with a sense of scruples and a woman who forges passports team up in freshman director Anton Fuqua's gritty crime thriller "The Replacement Killers" that marked Chow Yun-Fat's American film debut. Naturally, Chow plays the killer with a conscience who has no qualms about terminating his targets with extreme prejudice until he is required to kill a seven year old child. As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of "Die Another Day"); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of "Mississippi Burning"), who killed his son lose his own son. "A child is irreplaceable," Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. "Scar City" scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up. "The Replacement Killer" is neither as exciting as either "The Killer" or "Hardboiled," but at 88 lean, mean minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome. "Poetic Justice" lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. "The Rock" composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of "Mighty Aphrodite") who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow of "Beverly Hills Cop 2") and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. "Don confuse luck with skill," Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys. Mind you, this potboiler isn't any great shakes, but you'll be entertained, especially if you're a die-hard Chow fan.

    I remember my dad renting "The Replacement Killers" sometime around 1999 or 2000 from blockbuster for me and him to watch. I was very young at the time and I did not remember a thing about the movie. I watched this movie today on netflix. Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a contract killer working for Terence Wei, a ruthless Chinese mafia boss. John baulks at an assignment requiring him to kill the seven-year son of a cop; Wei sends other killers after the cop and his son, and after John to punish him for his disobedience. John seeks a false passport from forger and petty criminal Meg Coburn (played with grit and street-smarts by Mira Sorvino) to return to China to protect his mother and sister from Wei's revenge. John ends up kidnapping Meg while trying to stay one step ahead of Wei's thugs and the police. I thought this film was fairly decent the acting was pretty good, the camera angles were good, decent action and not a bad soundtrack to go with it. About the action there were no physical fights, just a lot of nonstop gun fights. I'm not really a fan of Chow Yun-Fat but his performance in this film was pretty good, but i wish he had more dialogue.

    I have watched this movie so many times that I can't remember how many. Although I have read that Sorvino and Chow didn't get along very well during the filming, you would never know it based on the chemistry between the two of them on the screen. They are perfectly paired. The gunfight scenes in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. More bullets fly than you can ever possibly count, and Chow Yun-Fat can shoot two guns with more determination than anyone else in the industry. He moves like art in motion. I have seen many of Chow's movies, and I consider this one to be one of his best, so if you like John Woo Hong Kong action movies you need to watch this one and watch the sparks fly.

    Low angle shots, slow motion scenes, and a host of well chosen techniques show why Antoine Fuqua has become a force of nature in the film industry. The film combines elements of Blade Runner with a dark, gritty plot and a no-nonsense dialog that keeps you riveted to the screen. The influence of Ridley Scott and John Woo are evident, and the resulting picture stands out as an epic in crime stories. Chow Yun-Fat, a star in the orient and a cult favorite in the US, is John Lee, an unwilling but able assassin bound by duty and honor to his boss, played elegantly by Kenneth Tsang. Mira Sorvino is the hard, independent woman working on the fringe of the law, but careful not to get involved in the business of criminals. Jurgen Prochnow is the trusted right hand man of Mr. Wei (Tsang). Of particular note is Clifton Collins Jr as the street thug who turns informant. Micheal Rooker and Carlos Gomez work well together as the detectives looking to bring down the killers, and both Schweiger and Trejo convince you they are the people your mother warned you about. The action is non-stop, the plot logical and plausible, and the overall effect will draw you into the film sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of violence, lots of language, not for the kiddies. If you like a fast paced action film with gritty, visceral action, this is it.

    There are many words to describe how awful this is, but why waste time. This is just the sort of one-dimensional, violent trash that deservedly ends up in the bargain bin at the local gas station. Sorvino was a recognised talent at this stage of her career, so why she got involved with this is a mystery. In fact the cast as a whole is not too bad, and there is some competent camera work and beautiful lighting - almost stylish. But there are too many negatives - ridiculous plot, silly script, terrible editing and a lousy soundtrack. The violence is gratuitous and totally OTT in this context. Watch something else.

    While I am not a huge fan of Anton Fuqua, I do believe he made a great feature with Chow Yun Fat's North American movie debut. The studio made so much bones about "getting it right" that while the finished piece smoked the box office, I can't help but feel that Anton had much more in mind than just an action piece when this was made. I would think that fans of AF and CYF would want to see a Director's Cut at some point to see the dramatic elements that were left on the cutting room floor, especially the romance that developed between John Lee and Meg Coburn. I continue to enjoy this movie and the vibe it leaves is always thrilling, but I get the feeling that Anton's vision was dumbed down for public consumption.

    Chow Yun-Fat is extremely famous for his work with director John Woo. He has established an ice cool persona, and is highly recognized for his "diving through the air with dual pistols" signature. Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie. Yet that isn't an entirely bad thing.

    The beginning had the gritty Miami Vice (2006) look and beat of director Michael Mann. Antoine Fuqua in his first directorial job and known for his subsequent hit Training Day (2001) and more recently Olympus Has Fallen (2013) did reasonable well. The plot was understandable if not original and his attempts at humanizing the characters and time spent was reflective of his future efforts. Surprising its the main character as a hit man played by Yun-Fat Chow that's a letdown. His scripted behavior as a hit-man doesn't have the finesse or the dazzling exploitation of martial arts that other action movies has shown to retain a high level of interest. Other preferable viewing options would be Matt Damon's Bourne Identity (2002) set a high bar for cool-headed and engaging assassination work. Shadowboxer (2005), Wild Target (2009), Leon: The Professional (1994), Enemy of the State (1998), Elektra (2005), The Air I Breathe (2007), Pulp Fiction (1994).

    This shockingly dull actioner stars Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man who refuses to carry out a contract on a cop's son and then scarpers to avoid retribution from his boss. Blazing a trail of rotten ideas across the screen, the screenplay saves most of its atrocious dialogue for Mira Sorvino, who tearfully pushes her Oscar to the back of her broom closet in order to play a forger caught up in the whole sorry mess. Antoine Fuqua batters us into submission with his frenetic direction and throws in more slow motion shots than John Woo would find acceptable, none of the cast bothers to act, and Michael Rooker's doormat beard is irritating. Some of the music's not bad, and that's the film's only tolerable element.

    First time Director Fuqua will go on to make better Movies, much better. Chow-Yun Fat has made Movies, with John Woo, that are Classics. But here is a frustrating attempt to bring Chow to American Audiences and it fails on almost every level. There are more bullets than words in this shallow and derivative Script. The Actors are solely determined and the Movie looks great. The problem is that there are a numbing number of Gunfights that consist of not much more that the firing of Guns with little or no Style. Two fine and engaging Stars and a Director with a future are the only reasons to give this a view, or maybe if you like the sound of steel on steel and the firing of automatic weapons. But be warned, this may put you off the better Movies of the Genre and that includes just about all of them.

    A deadly Chinese assassin with a sense of scruples and a woman who forges passports team up in freshman director Anton Fuqua's gritty crime thriller "The Replacement Killers" that marked Chow Yun-Fat's American film debut. Naturally, Chow plays the killer with a conscience who has no qualms about terminating his targets with extreme prejudice until he is required to kill a seven year old child. As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of "Die Another Day"); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of "Mississippi Burning"), who killed his son lose his own son. "A child is irreplaceable," Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. "Scar City" scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up. "The Replacement Killer" is neither as exciting as either "The Killer" or "Hardboiled," but at 88 lean, mean minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome. "Poetic Justice" lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. "The Rock" composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of "Mighty Aphrodite") who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow of "Beverly Hills Cop 2") and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. "Don confuse luck with skill," Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys. Mind you, this potboiler isn't any great shakes, but you'll be entertained, especially if you're a die-hard Chow fan.

    I remember my dad renting "The Replacement Killers" sometime around 1999 or 2000 from blockbuster for me and him to watch. I was very young at the time and I did not remember a thing about the movie. I watched this movie today on netflix. Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a contract killer working for Terence Wei, a ruthless Chinese mafia boss. John baulks at an assignment requiring him to kill the seven-year son of a cop; Wei sends other killers after the cop and his son, and after John to punish him for his disobedience. John seeks a false passport from forger and petty criminal Meg Coburn (played with grit and street-smarts by Mira Sorvino) to return to China to protect his mother and sister from Wei's revenge. John ends up kidnapping Meg while trying to stay one step ahead of Wei's thugs and the police. I thought this film was fairly decent the acting was pretty good, the camera angles were good, decent action and not a bad soundtrack to go with it. About the action there were no physical fights, just a lot of nonstop gun fights. I'm not really a fan of Chow Yun-Fat but his performance in this film was pretty good, but i wish he had more dialogue.

    I have watched this movie so many times that I can't remember how many. Although I have read that Sorvino and Chow didn't get along very well during the filming, you would never know it based on the chemistry between the two of them on the screen. They are perfectly paired. The gunfight scenes in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. More bullets fly than you can ever possibly count, and Chow Yun-Fat can shoot two guns with more determination than anyone else in the industry. He moves like art in motion. I have seen many of Chow's movies, and I consider this one to be one of his best, so if you like John Woo Hong Kong action movies you need to watch this one and watch the sparks fly.

    Low angle shots, slow motion scenes, and a host of well chosen techniques show why Antoine Fuqua has become a force of nature in the film industry. The film combines elements of Blade Runner with a dark, gritty plot and a no-nonsense dialog that keeps you riveted to the screen. The influence of Ridley Scott and John Woo are evident, and the resulting picture stands out as an epic in crime stories. Chow Yun-Fat, a star in the orient and a cult favorite in the US, is John Lee, an unwilling but able assassin bound by duty and honor to his boss, played elegantly by Kenneth Tsang. Mira Sorvino is the hard, independent woman working on the fringe of the law, but careful not to get involved in the business of criminals. Jurgen Prochnow is the trusted right hand man of Mr. Wei (Tsang). Of particular note is Clifton Collins Jr as the street thug who turns informant. Micheal Rooker and Carlos Gomez work well together as the detectives looking to bring down the killers, and both Schweiger and Trejo convince you they are the people your mother warned you about. The action is non-stop, the plot logical and plausible, and the overall effect will draw you into the film sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of violence, lots of language, not for the kiddies. If you like a fast paced action film with gritty, visceral action, this is it.

    There are many words to describe how awful this is, but why waste time. This is just the sort of one-dimensional, violent trash that deservedly ends up in the bargain bin at the local gas station. Sorvino was a recognised talent at this stage of her career, so why she got involved with this is a mystery. In fact the cast as a whole is not too bad, and there is some competent camera work and beautiful lighting - almost stylish. But there are too many negatives - ridiculous plot, silly script, terrible editing and a lousy soundtrack. The violence is gratuitous and totally OTT in this context. Watch something else.

    While I am not a huge fan of Anton Fuqua, I do believe he made a great feature with Chow Yun Fat's North American movie debut. The studio made so much bones about "getting it right" that while the finished piece smoked the box office, I can't help but feel that Anton had much more in mind than just an action piece when this was made. I would think that fans of AF and CYF would want to see a Director's Cut at some point to see the dramatic elements that were left on the cutting room floor, especially the romance that developed between John Lee and Meg Coburn. I continue to enjoy this movie and the vibe it leaves is always thrilling, but I get the feeling that Anton's vision was dumbed down for public consumption.

    Chow Yun-Fat is extremely famous for his work with director John Woo. He has established an ice cool persona, and is highly recognized for his "diving through the air with dual pistols" signature. Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie. Yet that isn't an entirely bad thing.

    First time Director Fuqua will go on to make better Movies, much better. Chow-Yun Fat has made Movies, with John Woo, that are Classics. But here is a frustrating attempt to bring Chow to American Audiences and it fails on almost every level. There are more bullets than words in this shallow and derivative Script. The Actors are solely determined and the Movie looks great. The problem is that there are a numbing number of Gunfights that consist of not much more that the firing of Guns with little or no Style. Two fine and engaging Stars and a Director with a future are the only reasons to give this a view, or maybe if you like the sound of steel on steel and the firing of automatic weapons. But be warned, this may put you off the better Movies of the Genre and that includes just about all of them.

    A deadly Chinese assassin with a sense of scruples and a woman who forges passports team up in freshman director Anton Fuqua's gritty crime thriller "The Replacement Killers" that marked Chow Yun-Fat's American film debut. Naturally, Chow plays the killer with a conscience who has no qualms about terminating his targets with extreme prejudice until he is required to kill a seven year old child. As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of "Die Another Day"); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of "Mississippi Burning"), who killed his son lose his own son. "A child is irreplaceable," Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. "Scar City" scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up. "The Replacement Killer" is neither as exciting as either "The Killer" or "Hardboiled," but at 88 lean, mean minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome. "Poetic Justice" lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. "The Rock" composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of "Mighty Aphrodite") who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow of "Beverly Hills Cop 2") and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. "Don confuse luck with skill," Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys. Mind you, this potboiler isn't any great shakes, but you'll be entertained, especially if you're a die-hard Chow fan.

    I remember my dad renting "The Replacement Killers" sometime around 1999 or 2000 from blockbuster for me and him to watch. I was very young at the time and I did not remember a thing about the movie. I watched this movie today on netflix. Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a contract killer working for Terence Wei, a ruthless Chinese mafia boss. John baulks at an assignment requiring him to kill the seven-year son of a cop; Wei sends other killers after the cop and his son, and after John to punish him for his disobedience. John seeks a false passport from forger and petty criminal Meg Coburn (played with grit and street-smarts by Mira Sorvino) to return to China to protect his mother and sister from Wei's revenge. John ends up kidnapping Meg while trying to stay one step ahead of Wei's thugs and the police. I thought this film was fairly decent the acting was pretty good, the camera angles were good, decent action and not a bad soundtrack to go with it. About the action there were no physical fights, just a lot of nonstop gun fights. I'm not really a fan of Chow Yun-Fat but his performance in this film was pretty good, but i wish he had more dialogue.

    I have watched this movie so many times that I can't remember how many. Although I have read that Sorvino and Chow didn't get along very well during the filming, you would never know it based on the chemistry between the two of them on the screen. They are perfectly paired. The gunfight scenes in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. More bullets fly than you can ever possibly count, and Chow Yun-Fat can shoot two guns with more determination than anyone else in the industry. He moves like art in motion. I have seen many of Chow's movies, and I consider this one to be one of his best, so if you like John Woo Hong Kong action movies you need to watch this one and watch the sparks fly.

    Low angle shots, slow motion scenes, and a host of well chosen techniques show why Antoine Fuqua has become a force of nature in the film industry. The film combines elements of Blade Runner with a dark, gritty plot and a no-nonsense dialog that keeps you riveted to the screen. The influence of Ridley Scott and John Woo are evident, and the resulting picture stands out as an epic in crime stories. Chow Yun-Fat, a star in the orient and a cult favorite in the US, is John Lee, an unwilling but able assassin bound by duty and honor to his boss, played elegantly by Kenneth Tsang. Mira Sorvino is the hard, independent woman working on the fringe of the law, but careful not to get involved in the business of criminals. Jurgen Prochnow is the trusted right hand man of Mr. Wei (Tsang). Of particular note is Clifton Collins Jr as the street thug who turns informant. Micheal Rooker and Carlos Gomez work well together as the detectives looking to bring down the killers, and both Schweiger and Trejo convince you they are the people your mother warned you about. The action is non-stop, the plot logical and plausible, and the overall effect will draw you into the film sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of violence, lots of language, not for the kiddies. If you like a fast paced action film with gritty, visceral action, this is it.

    There are many words to describe how awful this is, but why waste time. This is just the sort of one-dimensional, violent trash that deservedly ends up in the bargain bin at the local gas station. Sorvino was a recognised talent at this stage of her career, so why she got involved with this is a mystery. In fact the cast as a whole is not too bad, and there is some competent camera work and beautiful lighting - almost stylish. But there are too many negatives - ridiculous plot, silly script, terrible editing and a lousy soundtrack. The violence is gratuitous and totally OTT in this context. Watch something else.

    While I am not a huge fan of Anton Fuqua, I do believe he made a great feature with Chow Yun Fat's North American movie debut. The studio made so much bones about "getting it right" that while the finished piece smoked the box office, I can't help but feel that Anton had much more in mind than just an action piece when this was made. I would think that fans of AF and CYF would want to see a Director's Cut at some point to see the dramatic elements that were left on the cutting room floor, especially the romance that developed between John Lee and Meg Coburn. I continue to enjoy this movie and the vibe it leaves is always thrilling, but I get the feeling that Anton's vision was dumbed down for public consumption.

    Chow Yun-Fat is extremely famous for his work with director John Woo. He has established an ice cool persona, and is highly recognized for his "diving through the air with dual pistols" signature. Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie. Yet that isn't an entirely bad thing.

    The beginning had the gritty Miami Vice (2006) look and beat of director Michael Mann. Antoine Fuqua in his first directorial job and known for his subsequent hit Training Day (2001) and more recently Olympus Has Fallen (2013) did reasonable well. The plot was understandable if not original and his attempts at humanizing the characters and time spent was reflective of his future efforts. Surprising its the main character as a hit man played by Yun-Fat Chow that's a letdown. His scripted behavior as a hit-man doesn't have the finesse or the dazzling exploitation of martial arts that other action movies has shown to retain a high level of interest. Other preferable viewing options would be Matt Damon's Bourne Identity (2002) set a high bar for cool-headed and engaging assassination work. Shadowboxer (2005), Wild Target (2009), Leon: The Professional (1994), Enemy of the State (1998), Elektra (2005), The Air I Breathe (2007), Pulp Fiction (1994).

    This shockingly dull actioner stars Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man who refuses to carry out a contract on a cop's son and then scarpers to avoid retribution from his boss. Blazing a trail of rotten ideas across the screen, the screenplay saves most of its atrocious dialogue for Mira Sorvino, who tearfully pushes her Oscar to the back of her broom closet in order to play a forger caught up in the whole sorry mess. Antoine Fuqua batters us into submission with his frenetic direction and throws in more slow motion shots than John Woo would find acceptable, none of the cast bothers to act, and Michael Rooker's doormat beard is irritating. Some of the music's not bad, and that's the film's only tolerable element.

"Poetic Justice" lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. "The Rock" composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of "Mighty Aphrodite") who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow of "Beverly Hills Cop 2") and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. "Don confuse luck with skill," Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys. Mind you, this potboiler isn't any great shakes, but you'll be entertained, especially if you're a die-hard Chow fan.

    I remember my dad renting "The Replacement Killers" sometime around 1999 or 2000 from blockbuster for me and him to watch. I was very young at the time and I did not remember a thing about the movie. I watched this movie today on netflix. Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a contract killer working for Terence Wei, a ruthless Chinese mafia boss. John baulks at an assignment requiring him to kill the seven-year son of a cop; Wei sends other killers after the cop and his son, and after John to punish him for his disobedience. John seeks a false passport from forger and petty criminal Meg Coburn (played with grit and street-smarts by Mira Sorvino) to return to China to protect his mother and sister from Wei's revenge. John ends up kidnapping Meg while trying to stay one step ahead of Wei's thugs and the police. I thought this film was fairly decent the acting was pretty good, the camera angles were good, decent action and not a bad soundtrack to go with it. About the action there were no physical fights, just a lot of nonstop gun fights. I'm not really a fan of Chow Yun-Fat but his performance in this film was pretty good, but i wish he had more dialogue.

    I have watched this movie so many times that I can't remember how many. Although I have read that Sorvino and Chow didn't get along very well during the filming, you would never know it based on the chemistry between the two of them on the screen. They are perfectly paired. The gunfight scenes in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. More bullets fly than you can ever possibly count, and Chow Yun-Fat can shoot two guns with more determination than anyone else in the industry. He moves like art in motion. I have seen many of Chow's movies, and I consider this one to be one of his best, so if you like John Woo Hong Kong action movies you need to watch this one and watch the sparks fly.

    Low angle shots, slow motion scenes, and a host of well chosen techniques show why Antoine Fuqua has become a force of nature in the film industry. The film combines elements of Blade Runner with a dark, gritty plot and a no-nonsense dialog that keeps you riveted to the screen. The influence of Ridley Scott and John Woo are evident, and the resulting picture stands out as an epic in crime stories. Chow Yun-Fat, a star in the orient and a cult favorite in the US, is John Lee, an unwilling but able assassin bound by duty and honor to his boss, played elegantly by Kenneth Tsang. Mira Sorvino is the hard, independent woman working on the fringe of the law, but careful not to get involved in the business of criminals. Jurgen Prochnow is the trusted right hand man of Mr. Wei (Tsang). Of particular note is Clifton Collins Jr as the street thug who turns informant. Micheal Rooker and Carlos Gomez work well together as the detectives looking to bring down the killers, and both Schweiger and Trejo convince you they are the people your mother warned you about. The action is non-stop, the plot logical and plausible, and the overall effect will draw you into the film sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of violence, lots of language, not for the kiddies. If you like a fast paced action film with gritty, visceral action, this is it.

    There are many words to describe how awful this is, but why waste time. This is just the sort of one-dimensional, violent trash that deservedly ends up in the bargain bin at the local gas station. Sorvino was a recognised talent at this stage of her career, so why she got involved with this is a mystery. In fact the cast as a whole is not too bad, and there is some competent camera work and beautiful lighting - almost stylish. But there are too many negatives - ridiculous plot, silly script, terrible editing and a lousy soundtrack. The violence is gratuitous and totally OTT in this context. Watch something else.

    While I am not a huge fan of Anton Fuqua, I do believe he made a great feature with Chow Yun Fat's North American movie debut. The studio made so much bones about "getting it right" that while the finished piece smoked the box office, I can't help but feel that Anton had much more in mind than just an action piece when this was made. I would think that fans of AF and CYF would want to see a Director's Cut at some point to see the dramatic elements that were left on the cutting room floor, especially the romance that developed between John Lee and Meg Coburn. I continue to enjoy this movie and the vibe it leaves is always thrilling, but I get the feeling that Anton's vision was dumbed down for public consumption.

    Chow Yun-Fat is extremely famous for his work with director John Woo. He has established an ice cool persona, and is highly recognized for his "diving through the air with dual pistols" signature. Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie. Yet that isn't an entirely bad thing.

    The beginning had the gritty Miami Vice (2006) look and beat of director Michael Mann. Antoine Fuqua in his first directorial job and known for his subsequent hit Training Day (2001) and more recently Olympus Has Fallen (2013) did reasonable well. The plot was understandable if not original and his attempts at humanizing the characters and time spent was reflective of his future efforts. Surprising its the main character as a hit man played by Yun-Fat Chow that's a letdown. His scripted behavior as a hit-man doesn't have the finesse or the dazzling exploitation of martial arts that other action movies has shown to retain a high level of interest. Other preferable viewing options would be Matt Damon's Bourne Identity (2002) set a high bar for cool-headed and engaging assassination work. Shadowboxer (2005), Wild Target (2009), Leon: The Professional (1994), Enemy of the State (1998), Elektra (2005), The Air I Breathe (2007), Pulp Fiction (1994).

    This shockingly dull actioner stars Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man who refuses to carry out a contract on a cop's son and then scarpers to avoid retribution from his boss. Blazing a trail of rotten ideas across the screen, the screenplay saves most of its atrocious dialogue for Mira Sorvino, who tearfully pushes her Oscar to the back of her broom closet in order to play a forger caught up in the whole sorry mess. Antoine Fuqua batters us into submission with his frenetic direction and throws in more slow motion shots than John Woo would find acceptable, none of the cast bothers to act, and Michael Rooker's doormat beard is irritating. Some of the music's not bad, and that's the film's only tolerable element.

    First time Director Fuqua will go on to make better Movies, much better. Chow-Yun Fat has made Movies, with John Woo, that are Classics. But here is a frustrating attempt to bring Chow to American Audiences and it fails on almost every level. There are more bullets than words in this shallow and derivative Script. The Actors are solely determined and the Movie looks great. The problem is that there are a numbing number of Gunfights that consist of not much more that the firing of Guns with little or no Style. Two fine and engaging Stars and a Director with a future are the only reasons to give this a view, or maybe if you like the sound of steel on steel and the firing of automatic weapons. But be warned, this may put you off the better Movies of the Genre and that includes just about all of them.

    A deadly Chinese assassin with a sense of scruples and a woman who forges passports team up in freshman director Anton Fuqua's gritty crime thriller "The Replacement Killers" that marked Chow Yun-Fat's American film debut. Naturally, Chow plays the killer with a conscience who has no qualms about terminating his targets with extreme prejudice until he is required to kill a seven year old child. As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of "Die Another Day"); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of "Mississippi Burning"), who killed his son lose his own son. "A child is irreplaceable," Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. "Scar City" scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up.

    I remember my dad renting "The Replacement Killers" sometime around 1999 or 2000 from blockbuster for me and him to watch. I was very young at the time and I did not remember a thing about the movie. I watched this movie today on netflix. Chow Yun-Fat plays John Lee, a contract killer working for Terence Wei, a ruthless Chinese mafia boss. John baulks at an assignment requiring him to kill the seven-year son of a cop; Wei sends other killers after the cop and his son, and after John to punish him for his disobedience. John seeks a false passport from forger and petty criminal Meg Coburn (played with grit and street-smarts by Mira Sorvino) to return to China to protect his mother and sister from Wei's revenge. John ends up kidnapping Meg while trying to stay one step ahead of Wei's thugs and the police. I thought this film was fairly decent the acting was pretty good, the camera angles were good, decent action and not a bad soundtrack to go with it. About the action there were no physical fights, just a lot of nonstop gun fights. I'm not really a fan of Chow Yun-Fat but his performance in this film was pretty good, but i wish he had more dialogue.

    I have watched this movie so many times that I can't remember how many. Although I have read that Sorvino and Chow didn't get along very well during the filming, you would never know it based on the chemistry between the two of them on the screen. They are perfectly paired. The gunfight scenes in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. More bullets fly than you can ever possibly count, and Chow Yun-Fat can shoot two guns with more determination than anyone else in the industry. He moves like art in motion. I have seen many of Chow's movies, and I consider this one to be one of his best, so if you like John Woo Hong Kong action movies you need to watch this one and watch the sparks fly.

    Low angle shots, slow motion scenes, and a host of well chosen techniques show why Antoine Fuqua has become a force of nature in the film industry. The film combines elements of Blade Runner with a dark, gritty plot and a no-nonsense dialog that keeps you riveted to the screen. The influence of Ridley Scott and John Woo are evident, and the resulting picture stands out as an epic in crime stories. Chow Yun-Fat, a star in the orient and a cult favorite in the US, is John Lee, an unwilling but able assassin bound by duty and honor to his boss, played elegantly by Kenneth Tsang. Mira Sorvino is the hard, independent woman working on the fringe of the law, but careful not to get involved in the business of criminals. Jurgen Prochnow is the trusted right hand man of Mr. Wei (Tsang). Of particular note is Clifton Collins Jr as the street thug who turns informant. Micheal Rooker and Carlos Gomez work well together as the detectives looking to bring down the killers, and both Schweiger and Trejo convince you they are the people your mother warned you about. The action is non-stop, the plot logical and plausible, and the overall effect will draw you into the film sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of violence, lots of language, not for the kiddies. If you like a fast paced action film with gritty, visceral action, this is it.

    There are many words to describe how awful this is, but why waste time. This is just the sort of one-dimensional, violent trash that deservedly ends up in the bargain bin at the local gas station. Sorvino was a recognised talent at this stage of her career, so why she got involved with this is a mystery. In fact the cast as a whole is not too bad, and there is some competent camera work and beautiful lighting - almost stylish. But there are too many negatives - ridiculous plot, silly script, terrible editing and a lousy soundtrack. The violence is gratuitous and totally OTT in this context. Watch something else.

    While I am not a huge fan of Anton Fuqua, I do believe he made a great feature with Chow Yun Fat's North American movie debut. The studio made so much bones about "getting it right" that while the finished piece smoked the box office, I can't help but feel that Anton had much more in mind than just an action piece when this was made. I would think that fans of AF and CYF would want to see a Director's Cut at some point to see the dramatic elements that were left on the cutting room floor, especially the romance that developed between John Lee and Meg Coburn. I continue to enjoy this movie and the vibe it leaves is always thrilling, but I get the feeling that Anton's vision was dumbed down for public consumption.

    Chow Yun-Fat is extremely famous for his work with director John Woo. He has established an ice cool persona, and is highly recognized for his "diving through the air with dual pistols" signature. Director of The Replacement Killers seeks to play to Chow Yun-Fat's strengths, by making a movie that is in many ways similar to a John Woo movie. But it doesn't quite succeed. While The Replacement Killers seemingly offers everything your average Chow Yun-Fat/Woo film does, it is all delivered in a fairly bland fashion, resulting in a fairly forgettable movie. First and foremost, the is HEAPS of action in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat fires his two guns like he always does. There's shootouts in car washes, there's shootouts in apartments, there's shootouts in video arcades, there's shootouts in cinemas, and a variety of other places. The problem is, the action just seems pretty uninteresting, and the answer to why I can't quite explain. The story is decent for an action movie, and resembles that of The Killer, one of the most famous Chow Yun-Fat/Woo collaborations. Chow Yun-Fat himself looks pretty much exactly like he did in that movie. All the acting is quite good, with the exception of the HIGHLY ANNOYING Michael Rooker. There's some pretty big names in this movie. All in all, The Replacement Killers is a decent movie, but it doesn't really do anything above average, and just comes off as fairly uninteresting and bland. A shameless copy of a John Woo movie. Yet that isn't an entirely bad thing.

    The beginning had the gritty Miami Vice (2006) look and beat of director Michael Mann. Antoine Fuqua in his first directorial job and known for his subsequent hit Training Day (2001) and more recently Olympus Has Fallen (2013) did reasonable well. The plot was understandable if not original and his attempts at humanizing the characters and time spent was reflective of his future efforts. Surprising its the main character as a hit man played by Yun-Fat Chow that's a letdown. His scripted behavior as a hit-man doesn't have the finesse or the dazzling exploitation of martial arts that other action movies has shown to retain a high level of interest. Other preferable viewing options would be Matt Damon's Bourne Identity (2002) set a high bar for cool-headed and engaging assassination work. Shadowboxer (2005), Wild Target (2009), Leon: The Professional (1994), Enemy of the State (1998), Elektra (2005), The Air I Breathe (2007), Pulp Fiction (1994).

    This shockingly dull actioner stars Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man who refuses to carry out a contract on a cop's son and then scarpers to avoid retribution from his boss. Blazing a trail of rotten ideas across the screen, the screenplay saves most of its atrocious dialogue for Mira Sorvino, who tearfully pushes her Oscar to the back of her broom closet in order to play a forger caught up in the whole sorry mess. Antoine Fuqua batters us into submission with his frenetic direction and throws in more slow motion shots than John Woo would find acceptable, none of the cast bothers to act, and Michael Rooker's doormat beard is irritating. Some of the music's not bad, and that's the film's only tolerable element.

    First time Director Fuqua will go on to make better Movies, much better. Chow-Yun Fat has made Movies, with John Woo, that are Classics. But here is a frustrating attempt to bring Chow to American Audiences and it fails on almost every level. There are more bullets than words in this shallow and derivative Script. The Actors are solely determined and the Movie looks great. The problem is that there are a numbing number of Gunfights that consist of not much more that the firing of Guns with little or no Style. Two fine and engaging Stars and a Director with a future are the only reasons to give this a view, or maybe if you like the sound of steel on steel and the firing of automatic weapons. But be warned, this may put you off the better Movies of the Genre and that includes just about all of them.

    A deadly Chinese assassin with a sense of scruples and a woman who forges passports team up in freshman director Anton Fuqua's gritty crime thriller "The Replacement Killers" that marked Chow Yun-Fat's American film debut. Naturally, Chow plays the killer with a conscience who has no qualms about terminating his targets with extreme prejudice until he is required to kill a seven year old child. As it turns out, the man who hired John Lee is crime kingpin Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsung of "Die Another Day"); he wants to see the man, Detective Stan Zedlov (Michael Rooker of "Mississippi Burning"), who killed his son lose his own son. "A child is irreplaceable," Wei assures Lee who is an outsider. "Scar City" scenarist Ken Sanzel penned this straightforward shoot'em up. "The Replacement Killer" is neither as exciting as either "The Killer" or "Hardboiled," but at 88 lean, mean minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome. "Poetic Justice" lenser Peter Lyons Collister makes everything look dark and polished in this high body count actioneer. "The Rock" composer Harry Gregson-Williams furnishes an atmospheric orchestral sound track score that enhances the suspense. Lee has Zedlov's son in the sights of his rifle when he decides that he cannot kill a child, so he asks his friend for the name of somebody not associated with Wei who can create a passport for him. No sooner has John Lee gone to visit Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvina of "Mighty Aphrodite") who has an office in the Olive Building than Mr. Wei's henchmen are on to him. A brief but lethal shoot-out ensues with our hero making a clean getaway, but the police nab our heroine. Four of Wei's gunmen die in the shooting. Detective Zedkov doesn't have enough to arrest Meg so he lets her hit the street again in the hope that she will take him to what he wants. John Lee visits Meg again and they go to the car wash business that Eddie owns where they find not only his dead body but also Michaek Kogan (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow of "Beverly Hills Cop 2") and more gunmen. Zedkov and the cops show up after the main shoot-out but our hero and heroine manage to escape. "Don confuse luck with skill," Wei reprimands Kogan after the assassin eludes the villains at the car wash. Wei has Kogan hire the eponymous murderers. Til Schweiger plays Ryker, and Danny Trejo is cast as Collins. They arrive by airliner and try to ice Zedkov at a movie theater when he has his son with him. Lee and Meg show up to thwart their plans. Ryker dies, but Collins survives the fracas. At this point, John Lee decides to remove Wei as his primary source of trouble. Along the way, Meg helps him obtain is forged documents and firearms. They make a good team when they go into action gunning for the bad guys. Mind you, this potboiler isn't any great shakes, but you'll be entertained, especially if you're a die-hard Chow fan.
