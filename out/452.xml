 <sinopse>
  Police chief Brody must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The small island resort town of Amity is trying to bounce back from the financial troubles that suffered after becoming known as the site of shark attacks four years earlier. Mayor Larry Vaughn is welcoming developer Len Peterson and his new resort to Amity. Two scuba divers are exploring the area where the Orca sank after police chief Martin Brody killed a huge shark four years ago. A shark shows up and devoured the two divers, but not before one of the divers takes a close-up picture of the shark's eye, and sometime later, while a mother is driving a boat that's pulling her water-skiing teenage daughter, the shark devours the daughter and causes the mother to accidentally blow up the boat, then a killer whale is found on the shore with a huge bites on it. After Brody sees this, he knows there's another huge great white shark in Amity's waters, but Vaughn and Peterson explain these attacks away as non-shark accidents, because the thought of another shark in Amity's waters would drive...

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers. This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

    The original Jaws movie maybe superior to it sequels, but this sequel was a pretty good sequel. (Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge were both hilariously bad!) It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers. This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

    The original Jaws movie maybe superior to it sequels, but this sequel was a pretty good sequel. (Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge were both hilariously bad!) It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers.

I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers. This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

    The original Jaws movie maybe superior to it sequels, but this sequel was a pretty good sequel. (Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge were both hilariously bad!) It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be.

The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers. This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

    The original Jaws movie maybe superior to it sequels, but this sequel was a pretty good sequel. (Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge were both hilariously bad!) It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    This film is entirely unnecessary, it shouldn't even exist, I loved all four as a boy, but now I'm matured and see how truly naive I was, I realize these films became more and more terrible as they progressed, but really, I love the original, it is a classic, it is fantastic. This film shouldn't have happened, this film should never have seen the light of cinema, it is repulsive and unattractive in every way, I mean, the rare occasion of an enormous great white, a misfired rogue attacking an idle beach community created the masterpiece of Jaws, repeating this is purely idiotic, I mean trying the same thing twice, thrice and ultimately four times is just plain lunacy, and I mean it, doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results is the definition of insanity so I'm told. And this is what they did, they were quite insane, I would like to have stopped Jaws 2, and in effect stopped 3-D and The Revenge, I would like to have preserved Jaws as a stand- alone classic, and left it at that. But they couldn't leave it alone could they, they just couldn't help themselves. I suggest ignoring all these entirely unnecessary sequels because for pity's sake, the fourth film forgets the third, and the continuity becomes truly deranged, so its best to be ignorant, and just to only accept the original, to leave your world at that. Dear god, let these rumors of Jaws 5 just be simply that, or I might cry.

    In the words of Roger Ebert: "I hated, hated, hated this movie." Uninteresting, pointless, predictable. Those last two sentences express how I felt about "Jaws 2". I try to avoid using the word "boring" in my writing but I am forced to use it here: this is a boring movie. Dreadfully and painfully boring. It is strange to me how a brilliant film such as "Jaws" could have such a bad sequel. But this movie shows how possible it is. Not only was it uninteresting, but it was incredibly predicable. In my mind (or sometimes out loud), I would say what would happen next and, by golly, I was right almost the entire time. And to make it even worse, the story line was unoriginal. Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Without the talents of Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, this movie suffers greatly. The only part of this movie that was even relatively interesting was the ending, which I am not going to give away in case, for some reason, you do end up seeing this film.

    After the major success of the masterpiece Jaws. Universal Studios came up with the idea for a sequel. Peter Benchley didn't write a sequel to the novel Jaws. So the movie was purely the studio's idea. Despite the doubts from the fans, Jaws 2 is actually a pretty good movie. The use of the score is dead on with the original, and makes many of the scenes with the shark intense. Especially when the shark attacks the sail boat titled "Tina's Joy". Some of the scenes are pretty cool too, like when the shark attacks the helicopter. Most of the actors do a good job especially Roy Scheider who returns as Chief Brody. He's still very good in the roll. However some of the acting is really exaggerated, especially the actress who plays Jackie. All I can say about that is, "Overacting at its finest." The biggest problem with this movie is that after the scene where the shark attacks the water skier, the movie starts moving slow and barely anything happens until 20-30 minutes later. The common movie goer will probably get bored by this, but trust me, if you're patient, it'll be worth it, because the movie really kicks in at that point and doesn't stop until the end. Jaws 2 is a really good sequel. The middle is a little slow, but the rest is almost as adrenaline pumping as the original. Go see this movie. You'll have a lot of fun.

    Jaws 2 is no classic, but is a fun horror film that still keeps us interested through its agonizing moments. Another shark enters Amityville's waters and starts terrorizing the townsfolk again, but Brody gets make into action when his children's lives are at stake as they are being attacked by the shark while in their boats. The film is not paced very well, and the shark is unrealistic but is still fun. What helped make Jaws work was we knew it was a shark all along, but Spielberg still kept it hidden from us until almost halfway into the movie and was very effective. Since we all know what it looks like, Jeannot Szwarc shows it more often and it doesn't have the same effect as Jaws had on us, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. The film still has its jump scares and not always cheap ones. There were some that made my skin crawl by its appearance and still does and that's what's good with this film. Another good thing was bringing back the familiar face of Roy Scheider as Chief Brody. He is still a fun character and I would have liked to bring back Hooper, but I'm glad they brought him back. This film is good film as it is still rather fun and is one that I would recommend still seeing if you liked the first, but come in with low expectations. Me: B

    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...(did anyone really think it was?) comes the inevitable sequel to the mega-blockbuster. Story has another killer great white shark loose in Amity four years later, and once again Chief Brody(Roy Scheider returns, and is quite good) tries to convince the mayor and town council that the threat is very real...but of course they don't want to hear it! As sequels go, this isn't bad, though Steven Spielberg did not return as director, fellow "Night Gallery" director Jeannot Szwarc stepped in, and did a fine job, since the scenes on the ocean are quite effective, with a memorable finale. Pity the scenes on land are so mundane, with the focus being on a group of teenagers(Brody's sons among them) entering a ill-timed sailing race. Marginal quality film just misses, but still has some merit, and is at least tolerable.

    Before there were Mega Cinemaplexes, we had to stand outside in the hot summer heat for hours just to get the chance to watch a disappointing sequel like JAWS 2. I think for this reason alone, I have been far too harsh in my criticism of JAWS 2 over the years. And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time) First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways. Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished. However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch. This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference. Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago. The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie. In a 70's exploitation flick kind of way. Strangely, the teenagers are being slowly terrorized at sea by a giant shark that has over the coarse of two movies (by my count) already taken down three boats, a Killer Whale and a helicopter. But, can't seem to figure out a way of dealing with these teenagers in tiny broken sail boats for some reason, who have no means of defending themselves. I mean c'mon! What is the shark waiting for? Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience. And, you actually end up rooting for the Shark to just attack the teenagers to get the whole thing over with, so we don't have to spend anymore time with these people. After the movie, I remember walking past a long line of people waiting outside in the hot summer heat in anxious anticipation of seeing the sequel to JAWS for the very first time. Just as I had done only a few hours ago. Somebody waiting in line asked me as I was passing them, "How was the movie?". I turned and replied, "The shark is bigger this time!". Admittedly, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but at least it was one good thing I could say about the movie at the time.

    In the first movie Roy Scheider had to convince the townsfolk that a shark was attacking swimmers, but no one wanted to believe him. In this first sequel Roy Scheider has to convince the townsfolk that another shark is attacking swimmers, but no one... you get the idea. No new ground is broken here, no tension is created, no memorable characters appear and no reason for the film to exist (beyond financial gain) ever materialises. The original film had Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw under the direction of Spielberg at the height of his powers. This one has a bunch of annoying teenagers under the direction of Jeannot Szwarc, director of 'Supergirl' and 'Santa Claus: The Movie', with Scheider returning under duress. You can see the problem. It starts rather well, to be honest, but then plods along repetitiously for the next ninety minutes until the extended finale. The film makes the mistake of revealing the shark too early, eliminating any suspense as to whether Scheider is right about a possible shark problem (yes, that's where the movie has to go but it could at least try to create some dramatic tension). It's all right, I suppose, but it's all very ordinary, not to mention completely pointless.

    The sequel with one of the most mocked and spoofed taglines of all time, "Jaws 2" naturally is no classic compared to the terrific original. But it's still pretty well done, if slow to get started, and emerges as a pretty good sequel. One does indeed miss Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss quite a bit, but Police Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) story is compelling in its own right, as his demons threaten to get the better of him. The large assortment of new characters isn't terribly interesting, but Scheider is a treat to watch as he reprises the role of Brody. The shark scenes do prove to be worth waiting for. The story (the movie is scripted by Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of the first film, and Howard Sackler) is easy enough to predict: another rogue killer great white stakes a claim in the waters off of Amity Island. Brody suspects the worst early on, but of course nobody will believe him, not the mayor (Murray Hamilton) nor the new bigwig in town, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo). Ultimately it's entirely up to Brody to save the day as the shark, terrorizing some and gobbling up others, sets its sights on a gang of teenagers out day sailing. While we wait for the action to really take off, the movie centres around Brody and his futile attempts to warn people of the danger and the toll that it takes on him. One can't help but sympathize with this guy, especially since we know he's right. The shark effects are basically comparable to those in the first film, no better and no worse. Bruce mark 2 never gets around to actually eating very many people, but he does figure in some absolutely priceless moments: one involving a ski boat driver, and the other involving a helicopter. Lorraine Gary is appealing as before, once again playing Ellen Brody, and Jeffrey Kramer also returns as Deputy Hendricks. New cast members include lovely Ann Dusenberry, Donna Wilkes ("Angel"), Gary Springer ("Dog Day Afternoon"), and actor turned director Keith Gordon ("Christine") as some of the kids. Director Jeannot Szwarc ("Bug"), brought in to replace John Hancock ("Let's Scare Jessica to Death"), may not be as masterful as Spielberg but he's no slouch either, and he's assisted by such talents as composer John Williams, editor Neil Travis, production designer Joe Alves, and cinematographer Michael Butler. All in all, a good if not great movie with some good action and suspense - not to mention a hell of a conclusion. Seven out of 10.

    The original Jaws movie maybe superior to it sequels, but this sequel was a pretty good sequel. (Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge were both hilariously bad!) It had the generic shark attacks, but the theme was a completely different thing. It focused mainly around teenage romance. I personally didn't think it was scary enough for me, but it would almost certainly be scary enough for a kid to stay out of the water. Chief Brody was a very good life guard character. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    This movie is not as good as the first but it seems like a lot of people hate this one while really liking the first one and that does not make sense to me. The acting and directing is good and its just as thrilling as the first the only bad thing I would have to say is its the exact same thing as the first one so its really nothing new. This movie is about chief brody (Schneider) who has to protect the citizens of Amity from a monstrous great white shark ( yes the same as the first one ) This movie is a lot like the first but if you like the first one you will probably still like this one although with the addition of more cast members the acting from some is not great
