    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

    Malice is wonderful drama thriller. it was made in the early 1990s with great actors like Alec Baldwin and Nicolde Kidman who by that time was just being recognized by the Hollywood critics due to her potentials and amazing ability to adopt to different scripts . the film is about a twisted law suit between Kidman and Baldwin which turns out to be a roller coaster ride of lies and massive turn of events . when the film starts you think it is going to be another clich&eacute;d version of crime dramas where girls get murdered and no one can fine out who is doing it till the end . on the contrary , these crimes were just a distraction in order to support the element of surprise. the director would mislead you in the mini details of the story and then he would put all the cards on the table which would regain the trust of the viewer after they were trying to put the pieces together . that is how a great director should be . misleading at times. and respectful to the viewer's vision which was clear in this one . Baldwin and Pullman did a great job . Kidman again proved to be a strong character in all her movies and always up for a challenge .the ending was unforgettable and the plot was so twisted it kept you guessing . i consider this film to be another gem that is put in the same category of The hand that rocks the cradle , Misery , Fatal attraction, Basic instinct, and other classic drama thrillers that changed the history of cinema and raised the bar high which made directors think twice before doing such projects . i highly recommend watching this one and you may ignore all the reviews that came out rating this film as clich&eacute;d and forgettable . it is far from that . you would really enjoy it and think of adding it to your video library .tarek s.

The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

    Malice is wonderful drama thriller. it was made in the early 1990s with great actors like Alec Baldwin and Nicolde Kidman who by that time was just being recognized by the Hollywood critics due to her potentials and amazing ability to adopt to different scripts . the film is about a twisted law suit between Kidman and Baldwin which turns out to be a roller coaster ride of lies and massive turn of events . when the film starts you think it is going to be another clich&eacute;d version of crime dramas where girls get murdered and no one can fine out who is doing it till the end . on the contrary , these crimes were just a distraction in order to support the element of surprise. the director would mislead you in the mini details of the story and then he would put all the cards on the table which would regain the trust of the viewer after they were trying to put the pieces together . that is how a great director should be . misleading at times. and respectful to the viewer's vision which was clear in this one . Baldwin and Pullman did a great job . Kidman again proved to be a strong character in all her movies and always up for a challenge .the ending was unforgettable and the plot was so twisted it kept you guessing . i consider this film to be another gem that is put in the same category of The hand that rocks the cradle , Misery , Fatal attraction, Basic instinct, and other classic drama thrillers that changed the history of cinema and raised the bar high which made directors think twice before doing such projects . i highly recommend watching this one and you may ignore all the reviews that came out rating this film as clich&eacute;d and forgettable . it is far from that . you would really enjoy it and think of adding it to your video library .tarek s.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed.

Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

    Malice is wonderful drama thriller. it was made in the early 1990s with great actors like Alec Baldwin and Nicolde Kidman who by that time was just being recognized by the Hollywood critics due to her potentials and amazing ability to adopt to different scripts . the film is about a twisted law suit between Kidman and Baldwin which turns out to be a roller coaster ride of lies and massive turn of events . when the film starts you think it is going to be another clich&eacute;d version of crime dramas where girls get murdered and no one can fine out who is doing it till the end . on the contrary , these crimes were just a distraction in order to support the element of surprise. the director would mislead you in the mini details of the story and then he would put all the cards on the table which would regain the trust of the viewer after they were trying to put the pieces together . that is how a great director should be . misleading at times. and respectful to the viewer's vision which was clear in this one . Baldwin and Pullman did a great job . Kidman again proved to be a strong character in all her movies and always up for a challenge .the ending was unforgettable and the plot was so twisted it kept you guessing . i consider this film to be another gem that is put in the same category of The hand that rocks the cradle , Misery , Fatal attraction, Basic instinct, and other classic drama thrillers that changed the history of cinema and raised the bar high which made directors think twice before doing such projects . i highly recommend watching this one and you may ignore all the reviews that came out rating this film as clich&eacute;d and forgettable . it is far from that . you would really enjoy it and think of adding it to your video library .tarek s.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

    Malice is wonderful drama thriller. it was made in the early 1990s with great actors like Alec Baldwin and Nicolde Kidman who by that time was just being recognized by the Hollywood critics due to her potentials and amazing ability to adopt to different scripts . the film is about a twisted law suit between Kidman and Baldwin which turns out to be a roller coaster ride of lies and massive turn of events . when the film starts you think it is going to be another clich&eacute;d version of crime dramas where girls get murdered and no one can fine out who is doing it till the end . on the contrary , these crimes were just a distraction in order to support the element of surprise. the director would mislead you in the mini details of the story and then he would put all the cards on the table which would regain the trust of the viewer after they were trying to put the pieces together . that is how a great director should be . misleading at times. and respectful to the viewer's vision which was clear in this one . Baldwin and Pullman did a great job . Kidman again proved to be a strong character in all her movies and always up for a challenge .the ending was unforgettable and the plot was so twisted it kept you guessing . i consider this film to be another gem that is put in the same category of The hand that rocks the cradle , Misery , Fatal attraction, Basic instinct, and other classic drama thrillers that changed the history of cinema and raised the bar high which made directors think twice before doing such projects . i highly recommend watching this one and you may ignore all the reviews that came out rating this film as clich&eacute;d and forgettable . it is far from that . you would really enjoy it and think of adding it to your video library .tarek s.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students.

Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.

    Malice is wonderful drama thriller. it was made in the early 1990s with great actors like Alec Baldwin and Nicolde Kidman who by that time was just being recognized by the Hollywood critics due to her potentials and amazing ability to adopt to different scripts . the film is about a twisted law suit between Kidman and Baldwin which turns out to be a roller coaster ride of lies and massive turn of events . when the film starts you think it is going to be another clich&eacute;d version of crime dramas where girls get murdered and no one can fine out who is doing it till the end . on the contrary , these crimes were just a distraction in order to support the element of surprise. the director would mislead you in the mini details of the story and then he would put all the cards on the table which would regain the trust of the viewer after they were trying to put the pieces together . that is how a great director should be . misleading at times. and respectful to the viewer's vision which was clear in this one . Baldwin and Pullman did a great job . Kidman again proved to be a strong character in all her movies and always up for a challenge .the ending was unforgettable and the plot was so twisted it kept you guessing . i consider this film to be another gem that is put in the same category of The hand that rocks the cradle , Misery , Fatal attraction, Basic instinct, and other classic drama thrillers that changed the history of cinema and raised the bar high which made directors think twice before doing such projects . i highly recommend watching this one and you may ignore all the reviews that came out rating this film as clich&eacute;d and forgettable . it is far from that . you would really enjoy it and think of adding it to your video library .tarek s.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point.

    It's not a bad movie, only marginal. Better than today's movies, but still...it feels dated. I like the performances of the leads. But it gets frustratingly mean spirited as it gets to the end. Overall, it's a nostalgic watch very reminiscent of Hitchcock, but falls short when the people we want to suffer, don't. And there are inexplicable moments that draw out the story, such as the riddle- ladened drunken mother. There is NO reason she couldn't just come out and confess about her daughter. Also, they throw in an attorney to misguide you. There are plenty of moments where you do want to just shake the lead character's shoulder and tell him to leave. Or that the payoff to the comeuppance of the antagonist was to reveal an "a-ha!" moment. This seems forced. It's a good watch on a slow night.

    Very rare in a movie can a character be so likable like Dr. Jed then be hated. First seen your watching a brilliant doctor save a life in surgery. Then make friends with his victim. First time I watched this movie I was blown away how the writer plays with your emotions by turning like to hate. I would of fell for it if I was that character. Alex wasn't the only one that turned like into hate. Nicole Kidman was amazing at being a loving wife and even more amazing being a murderous greedy wench. This is a story I will never forget. Very rarely can a movie make you want more and more without letting you stop watching. Hopefully one day there is a remake of this overseen brilliant story. I just hope the casting is as good

    I watch "Malice" about once a year and always come and look at IMDb at some point while viewing. I'm continually amazed that this great suspense flick is not rated at least an "8". Excellent performances by Nicole Kidman, Anne Bancroft (albeit a very small role for her), even Alec Baldwin, whom I generally do not care for. Bill Pullman even pulls off his role perfectly as the mild mannered college prof. The only role I thought was not very strong was Bebe Neuwirth, who could not quite manage the accent. Malice is a first rate thriller all the way through. Tight script with just the right amount of build up of each of the characters and twists and surprises that I never saw coming. Even a very tiny role for a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Excellent supporting performances by George C. Scott and Peter Gallagher! Their roles were not very large but each gave a first rate performance that added strength to the film. Malice is best watched alone on a dark and stormy night. But I would not watch it with a fairly new significant other, it will leave you wondering.....

    Harold Becker Directed 'Malice' is A Superbly Acted Film! The Performances make this otherwise routine thriller, a must see! 'Malice' Synopsis: A tale about a happily married couple who would like to have children. Tracy teaches infants, Andy's a college professor. Things are never the same after she is taken to hospital and operated upon by Jed, a "know all" doctor. 'Malice' demanded a better Screenplay. No, the narrative isn't bad at all, its certainly watchable & potentially packaged, but there are some flaws. The pace could've been faster. The suspense wasn't as shocking as expected. Yet in all fairness, the Screenplay does indulge the viewer. Harold Becker's Direction is atmospheric. The Performances in 'Malice' are its True Merits. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as the manipulative doctor. Nicole Kidman is electrifying in a nicely written part. Bill Pullman is terrific as the central protagonist. These 3 Performances are truly compelling! On the whole, Watch 'Malice' for the performances!

    After a fellow IMDb'er recently told me that she is a fan of the Erotic-Thriller Basic Instic,I decided to go on the IMDb List and Recomandation board,to ask if there were any other Erotic- Thriller's,that a fan of Basic Instinct would enjoy.Checking the very kind lists of recs that I received from the board,I was surprised to find out that one of her fav actress's (Nicole Kidman) had made an Erotic-Thriller. Taking a look at the info of the movie,whilst also taking part in a poll that was being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best titles of 1993,I was disappointed to find out that Malice had come out in 1993,due to there not being enough time for me to get hold of the movie before the poll closed. A week later: With having stayed pretty quiet about my disappointment over not being able to watch Malice for the poll,I was completely caught by surprise,when a very kind IMDb'er gave me the great offer of being able to borrow the title,which led to me excitingly getting ready to come face to face with Malice for the first time. The plot: Rushing to the local hospital after being told that one of his students has been found brutally raped and left for dead,college professor Andy Safian talks to the hospital's leading doctor:Dr Jed Hill.To Andy's relief,Jed tells Hill,that although the patient was very close to dying,he has thankfully been able to save her.Joining her husband at the hospital,Andy introduces his wife Tracy Kennsinger to Jed Hill,who Andy praises for saving the life of one of his students. Strugling to think of a way that he can fully say thank you to Hill,Safian decides to ignore the objection's raised by Tracy,and offers Jed to become a tenet (for free) of the top floor in the new house that Andy and Tracy have recently brought.Astonished by Safian's display of kindness,Hill accepts the offer,and tells Andy that he will do everything he can to help the couple with the pregnancy problems the Safian has recently told Jed that he and his wife are suffering from. A few days later: Playing some darts and sharing a round of drinks with his work mates,Jed suddenly gets a call from the hospital,who tell Hill that he needs to come in right away,so that he can perform an emergency operation on a patient who has just been brought in to the hospital.Arriving at the hospital,Jed is horrified to discover that the dying patient is in fact Tracy Kennsinger,who is suffering from a raptured ovaries,due to a cyst.Taking X-Ray's shortly before operating to remove the ovaries,Hill discovers that Tracy is in fact 5 weeks pregnantÂ… View on the film: Avoiding the easy option of turning the movie into a simple "skin" show, (with the only main showing of flesh in the film being a naked,possibly body doubled,Nicole Kidman) director Harold Becker instead takes the film into a slivering Neo-Noir direction.For the first 30 minutes of the movie,Becker and cinematography Gordon Willis use Autumn colours to create a strong feeling of a varnish being added to the cheerful lives of Andy and Tracy.As Any and Tracy start to develop a friendship with Jed Hill,Becker rips the varnish off shred by shred,to reveal,that underneath the "shiny" appearance,lays wood that is covered by decaying greed and betrayal. Whilst Scott Frank and Aaron Sorkin's (with future Sorkin regular Joshua Malina also featuring in a small role) screenplay does feature a serial killer, (played by future "Jigsaw" Tobin Bell) who seems to have been chucked in just because the writer's seemed to suspect that the movie was lacking a needless serial killer angle,Frank and Sorkin smartly decide to use the first half an hour of the film to build up the relationships between the character's,so that they can then delightfully spend the rest of this Neo-Noir's time revealing the dark betrayal's lurking beneath,with Sorkin showing an early ear for whip-smart dialogue,as Sorkin gives Jed Hill cracking lines,that makes the character sound like a walking mega manic. Entering the film in blistering form,Alec Baldwin gives a delightfully scenery cheering performance as Dr.Jed Hill,thanks to Baldwin delivering the terrific dialogue with an irresistible relish,and Baldwin also showing Jed slowly change,from a mild-mannered,good hearted doctor,into something much more sinister.Along with Baldwin,Bill Pullman gives the film some real folk-like charm,as the very out of his comfort zone Andy,whilst Anne Bancroft gives a great,deranged,Miss Havisham style performance,and Nicole Kidman gives a strong,icy Femme Fatle dame performance,which unleashes the full malicious darkness contained within this varnished Neo-Noir.

    "Malice" is a tremendously enjoyable psychological thriller with an off-beat story which is full of surprises, suspense and unpredictable characters. Murder, deception and betrayal figure prominently and frequent plot twists make it extremely gripping right from the start. The action is perfectly paced, the dialogue is sharp and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography contributes strongly to the atmosphere of the piece. In a small town in Massachusetts, a young married couple who long to have children spend their spare time and a great deal of their money on renovating their Victorian house. In the day, Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) works in the children's ward of the local hospital and her husband Andy (Bill Pullman) is an associate dean at the town's college. Andy's job has become more difficult recently due to the activities of a serial rapist and killer who has been targeting the college students and this has led to Andy being critical of Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) for not making quicker progress in hunting down the culprit. Dr Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is a surgeon with a big reputation who's new to the town and immediately impresses his colleagues by saving the life of one of the rape victims. Andy recognises Jed as an old schoolmate and offers him temporary accommodation at his home until the doctor can find a suitable property of his own. This appears to be a good arrangement for both men and Andy looks forward to the extra income helping to fund his on-going renovation work. Tracy doesn't really take to Jed and soon becomes unhappy about his presence in her home, especially when he proves to be an extremely noisy tenant who regularly brings different women back to his room. After another of Andy's students is killed and he finds the body, Detective Harris suspects him of being involved and he's asked to provide a sperm sample. Tracy is suddenly taken ill with severe abdominal pains and is rushed to hospital where she's immediately operated on by Jed who has to remove one of her ovaries. Due to a problem also being identified with the second ovary, Jed speaks to Andy and explains that unless the second ovary is removed, it's possible that Tracy will die. In view of the circumstances, the heartbroken Andy gives his consent, the operation is completed and Tracy makes a full recovery. Tracy reacts angrily to what's happened and decides to sue Jed and then leaves Andy because he gave his permission for the operation to go ahead. Her action against Jed is successful and a settlement of $20,000,000 is agreed in her favour. Andy is cleared of any suspicion of involvement in the rapes but when he tells Detective Harris that it had been discovered during the operation that Tracy was pregnant, she informs him that he couldn't have been the father because his sperm sample confirmed that he was sterile. Obviously shocked by this information, he then embarks on an investigation that uncovers a whole series of shocking revelations. "Malice" has a strong cast and the quality of the acting is particularly good. The cameos featuring Anne Bancroft and George C Scott stand out but the best performance comes from Alec Baldwin as the extremely conceited surgeon who drinks and womanises too much and suffers from a "God complex". He has the power to be both charming and threatening and really brings his colourful character to life. Bill Pullman does a good job as the hapless husband who discovers how little he knows about his wife and Nicole Kidman does well in a role that requires her to show different and sometimes contrasting aspects of her complicated character. "Malice" is totally unpredictable, full of outrageous developments and often puzzling and amusing at the same time. As a source of pure entertainment, it's great.

    Andy Safian is a small town college dean, and his wife Tracey is a school teacher. They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer: he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

    Malice is directed by Harold Becker and co-written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank from a story by Jonas McCord. It stars Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Bebe Neuwirth and Josef Sommer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Andy (Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Kidman) take in a respectable Dr. Jed Hill (Baldwin) as a lodger thinking he ticks all the ace lodger boxes. However, he turns out to be far from ace and after having to perform emergency surgery on Tracy, the Safian's world gets turned upside down... Malice is an old fashioned thriller, it has flaws and major implausibilities, but if taken on its own popcorn thriller terms it rounds out as a good night's entertainment. There's considerable thriller talent involved in the production, with Becker (Sea of Love), Frank (Dead Again), Sorkin (A Few Good Men), Kidman (Dead Calm) and Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) all having been party to producing some quality genre offerings. It's loaded with betrayals and shifty shenanigans, and when the surprises come they are genuinely smart and worth the wait. But why the makers decided to tag in a pointless serial killer sub-plot is anyone's guess since it has no bearing on the otherwise well thought out story. Cast are on form, with Baldwin revelling in oily egomania and Pullman classical in gullible's travels mode. You will wish it had a more thundering climax, even if it is actually a touch clever, and credibility is often stretched to breaking point, but Malice operates out of the upper echelons of 1990s thrillers and still remains entertaining today. 7/10

    I am a mystery/thriller fan and Malice is the kind of first-rate thriller that rarely comes along any more. One that truly challenges the expectations of the audience and involves red herrings and misdirection. Set in an upper scale New England college town, Malice focuses on happily married college dean Bill Pullman and wife Nicole Kidman. The town is reeling from a series of serial murders by an unknown killer and Kidman is more than a bit perturbed when Pullman decides to rent their upstairs room out to school buddy and egocentric surgeon Alec Baldwin. If you think that you know where Malice is going from that synopsis, then think again. There are several plots at work in Malice and the one that we think will be the main focus becomes a rather neat little red herring. The film is cleverly written, adeptly acted and Harold Becker (of Sea of Love fame) provides tight direction. It is a joy to re-watch the film to see how adroitly the filmmakers and writers use our expectations against us. The film also keeps us guessing. It provides us with a set of characters who seem to fit neatly into the thriller genre and then sets about to confound us. For instance, Kidman's character seems destined from the opening moments to be the quintessential damsel in distress. The cuddly, well-meaning heroine whose world is invaded by an untrustworthy and unwanted boarder, who may be far more malevolent than even she believes. However, the film turns that assumption on its head and allows the actress to run the gamut from A to Z. And she does so admirably - this is arguably one of her best and most underrated performances. Pullman is quite appealing as the ostensibly nice guy dean. Baldwin nails his role as the swaggering surgeon with a major God complex. His mid-film meltdown under a cross-examination is really quite marvelous to watch, as is Kidman's droll comeback to his posturing. Bebe Neuwirth also scores a memorable turn as a local cop investigating the deaths. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief part as an irresponsible student. Plus we get well-delineated cameos by George C. Scott, as Baldwin's former mentor, and Anne Bancroft, hamming it up in a surprise role. The film has genuine thrills, but it also keeps the audience consistently guessing as to who is doing what to whom and who is responsible for what. There are double-dealings and double-crosses, but all of them seem completely credible, and the film is also refreshingly free of gory violence. If the film has any real flaws it is merely an over-reliance on melodrama in the latter fourth. Additionally it seems unlikely that the mastermind behind the main plot would fall for such a suspicious snare as gets laid out in the climax. However, these seem relatively minor quibbles for a film that so astutely knows how to manipulate viewers and confound their initial impressions.
