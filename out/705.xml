 <sinopse>
  A silent film production company and cast make a difficult transition to sound.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are a famous on-screen romantic pair. Lina, however, mistakes the on-screen romance for real love. Don has worked hard to get where he is today, with his former partner Cosmo. When Don and Lina's latest film is transformed into a musical, Don has the perfect voice for the songs. But Lina - well, even with the best efforts of a diction coach, they still decide to dub over her voice. Kathy Selden is brought in, an aspiring actress, and while she is working on the movie, Don falls in love with her. Will Kathy continue to "aspire", or will she get the break she deserves ?

    Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl&eacute;s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich&eacute;d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

    The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.

    silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.

    What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly. The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal?? The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.

    I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.

    I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.

    What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.

    I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't "corny" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!

    Singin' in the Rain was a very good movie, it's use of color was a bit drastic but overall good considering the time period. Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.

    Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl&eacute;s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich&eacute;d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

    The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.

    silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.

    What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly. The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal?? The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.

    I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.

    I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.

    What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.

    I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't "corny" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!

    Singin' in the Rain was a very good movie, it's use of color was a bit drastic but overall good considering the time period. Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.

    The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.

    silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.

    What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly. The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal?? The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.

    I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.

    I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.

    What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.

    I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't "corny" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!

    Singin' in the Rain was a very good movie, it's use of color was a bit drastic but overall good considering the time period. Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.

    Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl&eacute;s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich&eacute;d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

    silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.

    What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly. The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal?? The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.

    I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.

    I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.

    What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.

    I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't "corny" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!

    Singin' in the Rain was a very good movie, it's use of color was a bit drastic but overall good considering the time period. Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.

    Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl&eacute;s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich&eacute;d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

    The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.

The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.

    I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.

    What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.

    I enjoyed every aspect of this movie. From the plot to the acting to the cinematography. Everything was made perfectly, and the songs weren't "corny" but instead catchy! The characters all evolve a little, and the annoying protagonist gets hers in the end. This movie is perfect for any age. This movie is a musical, if you didn't gather that. Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!

    Singin' in the Rain was a very good movie, it's use of color was a bit drastic but overall good considering the time period. Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.

    Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl&eacute;s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich&eacute;d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

    The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.

    silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.

    What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly. The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal?? The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.

    I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way.
