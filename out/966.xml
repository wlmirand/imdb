    This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.

    A dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who have absolutely no romantic chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, thereby making him think she is dead or not interested in him, makes no sense. Cary Grant's relationship with his grandmother is interesting, but it is depicted only briefly and quickly becomes a minor element in service of the lame main plot. Grant and Kerr both burst with charisma in other films, so fans of sophisticated relationship stories would do better to watch Kerr in "The Sundowners" (1960) or Grant in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940).

    I think I saw this when it was new, but not again until 2012. The film seems to be a typical 1950's romance--a somewhat soapy boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story. Imagine any Rock Hudson movie from the same period. Of course most movies can't help being dated, but this one is extremely slow moving. There are some musical numbers to further slow the pace. The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help. That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.

    You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making! I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.

    A maudlin example of that most reprehensible style of 1950s filmmaking that makes my head ache to look at. You know the style I'm talking about. Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional. Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time. The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep. And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-

    If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography. The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here. The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.

Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.

    This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.

    A dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who have absolutely no romantic chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, thereby making him think she is dead or not interested in him, makes no sense. Cary Grant's relationship with his grandmother is interesting, but it is depicted only briefly and quickly becomes a minor element in service of the lame main plot. Grant and Kerr both burst with charisma in other films, so fans of sophisticated relationship stories would do better to watch Kerr in "The Sundowners" (1960) or Grant in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940).

    I think I saw this when it was new, but not again until 2012. The film seems to be a typical 1950's romance--a somewhat soapy boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story. Imagine any Rock Hudson movie from the same period. Of course most movies can't help being dated, but this one is extremely slow moving. There are some musical numbers to further slow the pace. The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help. That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.

    You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making! I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.

    A maudlin example of that most reprehensible style of 1950s filmmaking that makes my head ache to look at. You know the style I'm talking about. Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional. Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time. The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep. And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-

    If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography. The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here. The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.

    This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.

    A dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who have absolutely no romantic chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, thereby making him think she is dead or not interested in him, makes no sense. Cary Grant's relationship with his grandmother is interesting, but it is depicted only briefly and quickly becomes a minor element in service of the lame main plot. Grant and Kerr both burst with charisma in other films, so fans of sophisticated relationship stories would do better to watch Kerr in "The Sundowners" (1960) or Grant in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940).

    I think I saw this when it was new, but not again until 2012. The film seems to be a typical 1950's romance--a somewhat soapy boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story. Imagine any Rock Hudson movie from the same period. Of course most movies can't help being dated, but this one is extremely slow moving. There are some musical numbers to further slow the pace. The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help. That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.

    You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making! I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.

    A maudlin example of that most reprehensible style of 1950s filmmaking that makes my head ache to look at. You know the style I'm talking about. Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional. Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time. The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep. And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-

    If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography. The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here. The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.

    This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.

    A dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who have absolutely no romantic chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, thereby making him think she is dead or not interested in him, makes no sense. Cary Grant's relationship with his grandmother is interesting, but it is depicted only briefly and quickly becomes a minor element in service of the lame main plot. Grant and Kerr both burst with charisma in other films, so fans of sophisticated relationship stories would do better to watch Kerr in "The Sundowners" (1960) or Grant in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940).

    I think I saw this when it was new, but not again until 2012. The film seems to be a typical 1950's romance--a somewhat soapy boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story. Imagine any Rock Hudson movie from the same period. Of course most movies can't help being dated, but this one is extremely slow moving. There are some musical numbers to further slow the pace. The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help. That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.

    You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making! I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.

    A maudlin example of that most reprehensible style of 1950s filmmaking that makes my head ache to look at. You know the style I'm talking about. Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional. Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time. The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep. And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-

    If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography. The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here. The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.

    This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.

    A dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who have absolutely no romantic chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, thereby making him think she is dead or not interested in him, makes no sense. Cary Grant's relationship with his grandmother is interesting, but it is depicted only briefly and quickly becomes a minor element in service of the lame main plot. Grant and Kerr both burst with charisma in other films, so fans of sophisticated relationship stories would do better to watch Kerr in "The Sundowners" (1960) or Grant in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940).

    I think I saw this when it was new, but not again until 2012. The film seems to be a typical 1950's romance--a somewhat soapy boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story. Imagine any Rock Hudson movie from the same period. Of course most movies can't help being dated, but this one is extremely slow moving. There are some musical numbers to further slow the pace. The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help. That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.

    You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making! I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.

    A maudlin example of that most reprehensible style of 1950s filmmaking that makes my head ache to look at. You know the style I'm talking about. Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional. Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time. The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep. And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-

    If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography. The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here. The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art?

To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother. Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr. The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs). One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive. Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air. To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.

    I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred. In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through. A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard. One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse

    This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs). Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.

    Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ... This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fianc&eacute;e, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.

    This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.
