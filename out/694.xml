  Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot, the daughter of a financially troubled aristocratic family, was persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, a young seaman, who, though promising, had poor family connections. When her father rents out the family estate to Admiral Croft, Anne is thrown into company with Frederick, because his sister is Mrs. Croft.

    Firstly the good points. Beautifully filmed with authentic on location shooting in Bath and the countryside. The village scenes are straight out of an 18th Century painting. Simple and effective use of piano music as a score. The great fault is the casting of the leads. Cirian Hinds is the least romantic looking actor. He has such a fierce forbidding face suitable for character roles but totally wrong for a man in love. Amanda Root is just too plain. I know she is supposed to be bordering on old maid but she is just so insipid looking no one could carry a torch for her. There is no chemistry between them. What a waste of a good production. I don't recommend you watch this or it will spoil your image of the story.

    In this adaptation of Persuasion you get the book almost entirely verbatim. The scenery is lush and alive but at the same time dull. It represents wonderfully how our heroine Anne sees life both before and after her Captain has come home, and both before and after he wins her heart a second time. You really see how embarrassed she is upon his return, you see how much she still loves him but how she will not be the one to stand in his way of true happiness. The characters all come to life and the actors bring their own take on all of them. Any lover of Jane Austen will appreciate how well this movie was made. This is one of the best book to movie translations ever seen on screen. 9/10

    I am marking this only with a 6, mainly because of 2 things: a) The plainness of the leading actress's appearance that I know it was the director's decision. You are going to tell me that the leading man was not exactly Prince Charming... Correct! However, it was very bothering watching for two hours a supposed 26 year old young woman appearing and behaving like she is 46!!! OK, at the start of the film she was on the edge of becoming a spinster... However, near the end of the film she was more appreciated and confident and she also had two suitors literary running after her... Not even THEN could the director let the poor actress put on some make up, wear something else than those old curtains and do something with that bloody hair of hers? b) Why the director wanted every character that he wanted us to dislike TALK WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL? Anne's sister Elizabeth, her father, Ms Pain, Mary, Louisa, ALL of them are at some stage doing that. However, is was not them that I wanted to slap, but the director - that believed that having people behaving like this he would have a worthy Jane Austen novel adaptation... What's next man? Directing a Shakespeare play adaptation, where the villains defecate in frond of us? Having said all that, the performances and the overall production were OK. The story could had been told with more lively pace (=less boring), though... and Anne could had been portrayed less than a cold "Plain Jane" girl... The only time we see her laugh is when she visits that widow, and to be honest I am not very well convinced that her heart was in it :) If you ignore all these, it is actually a watchable film :))

    I absolutely loved this Persuasion, for me it is a winner both as an adaptation and on its own merits and one of my personal favourite adaptations of the books of Jane Austen. The story is beautiful and emotional, and while not always true in essence the characters are interesting and not dull. The adaptation is rather short though, but it doesn't entirely matter when it is done so well. Persuasion looks wonderful too. The costumes, locations and photography look stunning, while the piano music that accompanies the adaptation is simple and beautiful without ever being repetitive. The dialogue is sophisticated and the acting is great, complete with solid support turns from Simon Russell Beale, Susan Fleetwood, Sophie Thompson and Corin Redgrave and wonderful lead ones from Amanda Root and particularly Ciaron Hinds. In conclusion, a beautiful adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy hair, etc. Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much. The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top. Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie. Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away?? All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.

    I really enjoy period movies; I really enjoy Jane Austen stories. It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her "poor me" expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore. But I have to say it's the one thing that stuck out for me on first viewing, and I found it very distracting, and hard to identify with her because of that.

    It is hard to name another film in which every single actor is cast so well and performs so well. Even the "smallest" roles are a treat. A miracle. And watching Amanda Root reminds me of that wonderful assertion by Judi Dench: "Acting isn't what you say; it's what you don't say," --- and Amanada Root can speak volumes without a word. The Musgrove family, and their home, constitute everyone's favourite dream of English rural paradise; and at every viewing I am riveted by that fabulous carpet. Charles Musgrove is so beautifully acted --- yes, you know he is a bit of a fool and insensitive, but you love him for his heartfelt honesty and generosity. Likewise, Admiral and Mrs Croft --- the married couple everyone wishes to be. When Mrs Croft (Fiona Shaw, a genius)is regaling the dinner party with her memories of home and sea, John Woodvine, as the admiral, is visible in the background, listening quietly, not looking at her, but permitting himself an exquisite, reticent, almost humble smile of contented happiness. There is not a single weakness in this wonderful PERSUASION.

    This is one of my favourite Jane Austen dramatisations. I really like it for three reasons: 1) Amanda Root is outstandingly good as Anne Elliot. She really captures the character to perfection, and it is a hard part to act, too, since in many scenes, especially in the first half, she is simply listening to other people, and all of her emotions are conveyed by means of facial expressions and body language. 2) The musical score. So many Jane Austen adaptations use an orchestral score. This one sticks to simple piano accompaniment and it works very well indeed. 3) The supporting cast. A lot of the supporting characters really come to life, thanks to excellent ensemble playing from the likes of Susan Fleetwood as Lady Russell, Robert Glenister as Captain Harville, Fiona Shaw as Mrs Croft and Simon Russell Beale as Charles Musgrove.

    I watched this adaptation only yesterday and watched it again today. I simply fell in love with it. It is not as lively or modern as the version from 2007 which is why I like it so much. I love the pace of the story and how every frame is carefully planned. The director and producers have taken the time to really tell the story with beauty and respect. We have the time to really get to know the characters. The problem with the newer adaptations of Jane Austens works is that they almost force the story and characters upon us in the most obvious ways. There is no authenticity and natural flow. In this film we get to know Anne very well even though she is silent and drawn back throughout most of the film. That is great acting and great storytelling. What is really important to understand is that you cannot always compare the adaptations to the original source as they are two completely different forms of art but as long as the film or TV series is true to the characters and spirit of the book it usually turns out very well. Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

    Although I have read all of Jane Austen, I am not a particular fan; I prefer her over any Bront&euml;, but far prefer Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy over the lot of them. My favorite of her novels is her last, Persuasion, so I was poised to have my high hopes dashed. But this film exceeded even elevated expectations for reasons visual, verbal-- and reverential (the marvelous Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth). Visual, first. Film adaptations of Austen (and her ilk) generally deliver a touch of grime along with glamor, but it's invariably picturesque: the tattered and torn peasants and ruffians are museum-quality. Not here. Director Roger Michel gets plain old mud on the skirts of his ladies during their long walks. Bad and/or yellow teeth abound, as they did in 1814, nowhere more notoriously than in England. Such small details are big indicators of how Michel, like Austen, prefers honest naturalism to pure aestheticism. Ivory-tower film-making is left to the likes of Merchant and Ivory. I hasten to add, however, that Michel also left the costume design to a very talented 33-year old, Alexandra Byrne, who has gone on to win an Oscar (for Elizabethan togs). Her Empire dresses and Royal navy chapeau-bras will not leave you wistful for Greer Garson wearing Adrian. As to the verbal: The screenplay perpetuates, as it must, Austen's repair to caricature for her satire. It is one of the author's failings, and it is writ large here; protagonist Anne (delicately brought to life by Amanda Root) is the only member of the Elliott family who isn't a grotesque: vain Sir Walter, strident Elizabeth, narcissistic Mary--all lack complexity, as do most of the women and many of the men. The caricatures do, however, provide comic context for the heart of the story. The number of times dutiful, plain Anne is influenced by persuasion from one buffoon or another is effectively stifling, and is therefore one of the ways in which this film adaptation truly reflects the novel. But this is cinema, not literature. Certain key moments in the film, some of them silent, reveal more than the dialog does to attentive viewers . At the shore in Lyme, all characters but two play with the sand and the surf; the two are Wentworth, who stares out at his true home, the sea, and Anne, who also simply gazes serenely out over the water toward freedom? adventure? Wentworth's true home? It sets Anne apart with lovely subtlety. Another moment occurs at the end (which returns to the opening scene, with ships), when she and Wentworth set sail. At the sight of their the full-rigged ship, I felt a tug toward freedom, too, away from all the persuasive pressures of society. Wentworth's ship, now her home too, truly did feel like independence, perhaps especially for a woman whose horizons in the early 19th century were still barbarically circumscribed.

Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

    Although I have read all of Jane Austen, I am not a particular fan; I prefer her over any Bront&euml;, but far prefer Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy over the lot of them. My favorite of her novels is her last, Persuasion, so I was poised to have my high hopes dashed. But this film exceeded even elevated expectations for reasons visual, verbal-- and reverential (the marvelous Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth). Visual, first. Film adaptations of Austen (and her ilk) generally deliver a touch of grime along with glamor, but it's invariably picturesque: the tattered and torn peasants and ruffians are museum-quality. Not here. Director Roger Michel gets plain old mud on the skirts of his ladies during their long walks. Bad and/or yellow teeth abound, as they did in 1814, nowhere more notoriously than in England. Such small details are big indicators of how Michel, like Austen, prefers honest naturalism to pure aestheticism. Ivory-tower film-making is left to the likes of Merchant and Ivory. I hasten to add, however, that Michel also left the costume design to a very talented 33-year old, Alexandra Byrne, who has gone on to win an Oscar (for Elizabethan togs). Her Empire dresses and Royal navy chapeau-bras will not leave you wistful for Greer Garson wearing Adrian. As to the verbal: The screenplay perpetuates, as it must, Austen's repair to caricature for her satire. It is one of the author's failings, and it is writ large here; protagonist Anne (delicately brought to life by Amanda Root) is the only member of the Elliott family who isn't a grotesque: vain Sir Walter, strident Elizabeth, narcissistic Mary--all lack complexity, as do most of the women and many of the men. The caricatures do, however, provide comic context for the heart of the story. The number of times dutiful, plain Anne is influenced by persuasion from one buffoon or another is effectively stifling, and is therefore one of the ways in which this film adaptation truly reflects the novel. But this is cinema, not literature. Certain key moments in the film, some of them silent, reveal more than the dialog does to attentive viewers . At the shore in Lyme, all characters but two play with the sand and the surf; the two are Wentworth, who stares out at his true home, the sea, and Anne, who also simply gazes serenely out over the water toward freedom? adventure? Wentworth's true home? It sets Anne apart with lovely subtlety. Another moment occurs at the end (which returns to the opening scene, with ships), when she and Wentworth set sail. At the sight of their the full-rigged ship, I felt a tug toward freedom, too, away from all the persuasive pressures of society. Wentworth's ship, now her home too, truly did feel like independence, perhaps especially for a woman whose horizons in the early 19th century were still barbarically circumscribed.

    Firstly the good points. Beautifully filmed with authentic on location shooting in Bath and the countryside. The village scenes are straight out of an 18th Century painting. Simple and effective use of piano music as a score. The great fault is the casting of the leads. Cirian Hinds is the least romantic looking actor. He has such a fierce forbidding face suitable for character roles but totally wrong for a man in love. Amanda Root is just too plain. I know she is supposed to be bordering on old maid but she is just so insipid looking no one could carry a torch for her. There is no chemistry between them. What a waste of a good production. I don't recommend you watch this or it will spoil your image of the story.

    In this adaptation of Persuasion you get the book almost entirely verbatim. The scenery is lush and alive but at the same time dull. It represents wonderfully how our heroine Anne sees life both before and after her Captain has come home, and both before and after he wins her heart a second time. You really see how embarrassed she is upon his return, you see how much she still loves him but how she will not be the one to stand in his way of true happiness. The characters all come to life and the actors bring their own take on all of them. Any lover of Jane Austen will appreciate how well this movie was made. This is one of the best book to movie translations ever seen on screen. 9/10

    I am marking this only with a 6, mainly because of 2 things: a) The plainness of the leading actress's appearance that I know it was the director's decision. You are going to tell me that the leading man was not exactly Prince Charming... Correct! However, it was very bothering watching for two hours a supposed 26 year old young woman appearing and behaving like she is 46!!! OK, at the start of the film she was on the edge of becoming a spinster... However, near the end of the film she was more appreciated and confident and she also had two suitors literary running after her... Not even THEN could the director let the poor actress put on some make up, wear something else than those old curtains and do something with that bloody hair of hers? b) Why the director wanted every character that he wanted us to dislike TALK WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL? Anne's sister Elizabeth, her father, Ms Pain, Mary, Louisa, ALL of them are at some stage doing that. However, is was not them that I wanted to slap, but the director - that believed that having people behaving like this he would have a worthy Jane Austen novel adaptation... What's next man? Directing a Shakespeare play adaptation, where the villains defecate in frond of us? Having said all that, the performances and the overall production were OK. The story could had been told with more lively pace (=less boring), though... and Anne could had been portrayed less than a cold "Plain Jane" girl... The only time we see her laugh is when she visits that widow, and to be honest I am not very well convinced that her heart was in it :) If you ignore all these, it is actually a watchable film :))

    I absolutely loved this Persuasion, for me it is a winner both as an adaptation and on its own merits and one of my personal favourite adaptations of the books of Jane Austen. The story is beautiful and emotional, and while not always true in essence the characters are interesting and not dull. The adaptation is rather short though, but it doesn't entirely matter when it is done so well. Persuasion looks wonderful too. The costumes, locations and photography look stunning, while the piano music that accompanies the adaptation is simple and beautiful without ever being repetitive. The dialogue is sophisticated and the acting is great, complete with solid support turns from Simon Russell Beale, Susan Fleetwood, Sophie Thompson and Corin Redgrave and wonderful lead ones from Amanda Root and particularly Ciaron Hinds. In conclusion, a beautiful adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy hair, etc. Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much. The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top. Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie. Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away?? All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.

    I really enjoy period movies; I really enjoy Jane Austen stories. It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her "poor me" expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore. But I have to say it's the one thing that stuck out for me on first viewing, and I found it very distracting, and hard to identify with her because of that.

    It is hard to name another film in which every single actor is cast so well and performs so well. Even the "smallest" roles are a treat. A miracle. And watching Amanda Root reminds me of that wonderful assertion by Judi Dench: "Acting isn't what you say; it's what you don't say," --- and Amanada Root can speak volumes without a word. The Musgrove family, and their home, constitute everyone's favourite dream of English rural paradise; and at every viewing I am riveted by that fabulous carpet. Charles Musgrove is so beautifully acted --- yes, you know he is a bit of a fool and insensitive, but you love him for his heartfelt honesty and generosity. Likewise, Admiral and Mrs Croft --- the married couple everyone wishes to be. When Mrs Croft (Fiona Shaw, a genius)is regaling the dinner party with her memories of home and sea, John Woodvine, as the admiral, is visible in the background, listening quietly, not looking at her, but permitting himself an exquisite, reticent, almost humble smile of contented happiness. There is not a single weakness in this wonderful PERSUASION.

    This is one of my favourite Jane Austen dramatisations. I really like it for three reasons: 1) Amanda Root is outstandingly good as Anne Elliot. She really captures the character to perfection, and it is a hard part to act, too, since in many scenes, especially in the first half, she is simply listening to other people, and all of her emotions are conveyed by means of facial expressions and body language. 2) The musical score. So many Jane Austen adaptations use an orchestral score. This one sticks to simple piano accompaniment and it works very well indeed. 3) The supporting cast. A lot of the supporting characters really come to life, thanks to excellent ensemble playing from the likes of Susan Fleetwood as Lady Russell, Robert Glenister as Captain Harville, Fiona Shaw as Mrs Croft and Simon Russell Beale as Charles Musgrove.

    I watched this adaptation only yesterday and watched it again today. I simply fell in love with it. It is not as lively or modern as the version from 2007 which is why I like it so much. I love the pace of the story and how every frame is carefully planned. The director and producers have taken the time to really tell the story with beauty and respect. We have the time to really get to know the characters. The problem with the newer adaptations of Jane Austens works is that they almost force the story and characters upon us in the most obvious ways. There is no authenticity and natural flow. In this film we get to know Anne very well even though she is silent and drawn back throughout most of the film. That is great acting and great storytelling. What is really important to understand is that you cannot always compare the adaptations to the original source as they are two completely different forms of art but as long as the film or TV series is true to the characters and spirit of the book it usually turns out very well. Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

She really captures the character to perfection, and it is a hard part to act, too, since in many scenes, especially in the first half, she is simply listening to other people, and all of her emotions are conveyed by means of facial expressions and body language. 2) The musical score. So many Jane Austen adaptations use an orchestral score. This one sticks to simple piano accompaniment and it works very well indeed. 3) The supporting cast. A lot of the supporting characters really come to life, thanks to excellent ensemble playing from the likes of Susan Fleetwood as Lady Russell, Robert Glenister as Captain Harville, Fiona Shaw as Mrs Croft and Simon Russell Beale as Charles Musgrove.

    I watched this adaptation only yesterday and watched it again today. I simply fell in love with it. It is not as lively or modern as the version from 2007 which is why I like it so much. I love the pace of the story and how every frame is carefully planned. The director and producers have taken the time to really tell the story with beauty and respect. We have the time to really get to know the characters. The problem with the newer adaptations of Jane Austens works is that they almost force the story and characters upon us in the most obvious ways. There is no authenticity and natural flow. In this film we get to know Anne very well even though she is silent and drawn back throughout most of the film. That is great acting and great storytelling. What is really important to understand is that you cannot always compare the adaptations to the original source as they are two completely different forms of art but as long as the film or TV series is true to the characters and spirit of the book it usually turns out very well. Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

    Although I have read all of Jane Austen, I am not a particular fan; I prefer her over any Bront&euml;, but far prefer Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy over the lot of them. My favorite of her novels is her last, Persuasion, so I was poised to have my high hopes dashed. But this film exceeded even elevated expectations for reasons visual, verbal-- and reverential (the marvelous Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth). Visual, first. Film adaptations of Austen (and her ilk) generally deliver a touch of grime along with glamor, but it's invariably picturesque: the tattered and torn peasants and ruffians are museum-quality. Not here. Director Roger Michel gets plain old mud on the skirts of his ladies during their long walks. Bad and/or yellow teeth abound, as they did in 1814, nowhere more notoriously than in England. Such small details are big indicators of how Michel, like Austen, prefers honest naturalism to pure aestheticism. Ivory-tower film-making is left to the likes of Merchant and Ivory. I hasten to add, however, that Michel also left the costume design to a very talented 33-year old, Alexandra Byrne, who has gone on to win an Oscar (for Elizabethan togs). Her Empire dresses and Royal navy chapeau-bras will not leave you wistful for Greer Garson wearing Adrian. As to the verbal: The screenplay perpetuates, as it must, Austen's repair to caricature for her satire. It is one of the author's failings, and it is writ large here; protagonist Anne (delicately brought to life by Amanda Root) is the only member of the Elliott family who isn't a grotesque: vain Sir Walter, strident Elizabeth, narcissistic Mary--all lack complexity, as do most of the women and many of the men. The caricatures do, however, provide comic context for the heart of the story. The number of times dutiful, plain Anne is influenced by persuasion from one buffoon or another is effectively stifling, and is therefore one of the ways in which this film adaptation truly reflects the novel. But this is cinema, not literature. Certain key moments in the film, some of them silent, reveal more than the dialog does to attentive viewers . At the shore in Lyme, all characters but two play with the sand and the surf; the two are Wentworth, who stares out at his true home, the sea, and Anne, who also simply gazes serenely out over the water toward freedom? adventure? Wentworth's true home? It sets Anne apart with lovely subtlety. Another moment occurs at the end (which returns to the opening scene, with ships), when she and Wentworth set sail. At the sight of their the full-rigged ship, I felt a tug toward freedom, too, away from all the persuasive pressures of society. Wentworth's ship, now her home too, truly did feel like independence, perhaps especially for a woman whose horizons in the early 19th century were still barbarically circumscribed.

    Firstly the good points. Beautifully filmed with authentic on location shooting in Bath and the countryside. The village scenes are straight out of an 18th Century painting. Simple and effective use of piano music as a score. The great fault is the casting of the leads. Cirian Hinds is the least romantic looking actor. He has such a fierce forbidding face suitable for character roles but totally wrong for a man in love. Amanda Root is just too plain. I know she is supposed to be bordering on old maid but she is just so insipid looking no one could carry a torch for her. There is no chemistry between them. What a waste of a good production. I don't recommend you watch this or it will spoil your image of the story.

    In this adaptation of Persuasion you get the book almost entirely verbatim. The scenery is lush and alive but at the same time dull. It represents wonderfully how our heroine Anne sees life both before and after her Captain has come home, and both before and after he wins her heart a second time. You really see how embarrassed she is upon his return, you see how much she still loves him but how she will not be the one to stand in his way of true happiness. The characters all come to life and the actors bring their own take on all of them. Any lover of Jane Austen will appreciate how well this movie was made. This is one of the best book to movie translations ever seen on screen. 9/10

    I am marking this only with a 6, mainly because of 2 things: a) The plainness of the leading actress's appearance that I know it was the director's decision. You are going to tell me that the leading man was not exactly Prince Charming... Correct! However, it was very bothering watching for two hours a supposed 26 year old young woman appearing and behaving like she is 46!!! OK, at the start of the film she was on the edge of becoming a spinster... However, near the end of the film she was more appreciated and confident and she also had two suitors literary running after her... Not even THEN could the director let the poor actress put on some make up, wear something else than those old curtains and do something with that bloody hair of hers? b) Why the director wanted every character that he wanted us to dislike TALK WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL? Anne's sister Elizabeth, her father, Ms Pain, Mary, Louisa, ALL of them are at some stage doing that. However, is was not them that I wanted to slap, but the director - that believed that having people behaving like this he would have a worthy Jane Austen novel adaptation... What's next man? Directing a Shakespeare play adaptation, where the villains defecate in frond of us? Having said all that, the performances and the overall production were OK. The story could had been told with more lively pace (=less boring), though... and Anne could had been portrayed less than a cold "Plain Jane" girl... The only time we see her laugh is when she visits that widow, and to be honest I am not very well convinced that her heart was in it :) If you ignore all these, it is actually a watchable film :))

    I absolutely loved this Persuasion, for me it is a winner both as an adaptation and on its own merits and one of my personal favourite adaptations of the books of Jane Austen. The story is beautiful and emotional, and while not always true in essence the characters are interesting and not dull. The adaptation is rather short though, but it doesn't entirely matter when it is done so well. Persuasion looks wonderful too. The costumes, locations and photography look stunning, while the piano music that accompanies the adaptation is simple and beautiful without ever being repetitive. The dialogue is sophisticated and the acting is great, complete with solid support turns from Simon Russell Beale, Susan Fleetwood, Sophie Thompson and Corin Redgrave and wonderful lead ones from Amanda Root and particularly Ciaron Hinds. In conclusion, a beautiful adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy hair, etc. Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much. The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top. Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie. Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away?? All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.

    I really enjoy period movies; I really enjoy Jane Austen stories. It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her "poor me" expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore. But I have to say it's the one thing that stuck out for me on first viewing, and I found it very distracting, and hard to identify with her because of that.

    It is hard to name another film in which every single actor is cast so well and performs so well. Even the "smallest" roles are a treat. A miracle. And watching Amanda Root reminds me of that wonderful assertion by Judi Dench: "Acting isn't what you say; it's what you don't say," --- and Amanada Root can speak volumes without a word. The Musgrove family, and their home, constitute everyone's favourite dream of English rural paradise; and at every viewing I am riveted by that fabulous carpet. Charles Musgrove is so beautifully acted --- yes, you know he is a bit of a fool and insensitive, but you love him for his heartfelt honesty and generosity. Likewise, Admiral and Mrs Croft --- the married couple everyone wishes to be. When Mrs Croft (Fiona Shaw, a genius)is regaling the dinner party with her memories of home and sea, John Woodvine, as the admiral, is visible in the background, listening quietly, not looking at her, but permitting himself an exquisite, reticent, almost humble smile of contented happiness. There is not a single weakness in this wonderful PERSUASION.

    It is hard to name another film in which every single actor is cast so well and performs so well. Even the "smallest" roles are a treat. A miracle. And watching Amanda Root reminds me of that wonderful assertion by Judi Dench: "Acting isn't what you say; it's what you don't say," --- and Amanada Root can speak volumes without a word. The Musgrove family, and their home, constitute everyone's favourite dream of English rural paradise; and at every viewing I am riveted by that fabulous carpet. Charles Musgrove is so beautifully acted --- yes, you know he is a bit of a fool and insensitive, but you love him for his heartfelt honesty and generosity. Likewise, Admiral and Mrs Croft --- the married couple everyone wishes to be. When Mrs Croft (Fiona Shaw, a genius)is regaling the dinner party with her memories of home and sea, John Woodvine, as the admiral, is visible in the background, listening quietly, not looking at her, but permitting himself an exquisite, reticent, almost humble smile of contented happiness. There is not a single weakness in this wonderful PERSUASION.

    This is one of my favourite Jane Austen dramatisations. I really like it for three reasons: 1) Amanda Root is outstandingly good as Anne Elliot. She really captures the character to perfection, and it is a hard part to act, too, since in many scenes, especially in the first half, she is simply listening to other people, and all of her emotions are conveyed by means of facial expressions and body language. 2) The musical score. So many Jane Austen adaptations use an orchestral score. This one sticks to simple piano accompaniment and it works very well indeed. 3) The supporting cast. A lot of the supporting characters really come to life, thanks to excellent ensemble playing from the likes of Susan Fleetwood as Lady Russell, Robert Glenister as Captain Harville, Fiona Shaw as Mrs Croft and Simon Russell Beale as Charles Musgrove.

    I watched this adaptation only yesterday and watched it again today. I simply fell in love with it. It is not as lively or modern as the version from 2007 which is why I like it so much. I love the pace of the story and how every frame is carefully planned. The director and producers have taken the time to really tell the story with beauty and respect. We have the time to really get to know the characters. The problem with the newer adaptations of Jane Austens works is that they almost force the story and characters upon us in the most obvious ways. There is no authenticity and natural flow. In this film we get to know Anne very well even though she is silent and drawn back throughout most of the film. That is great acting and great storytelling. What is really important to understand is that you cannot always compare the adaptations to the original source as they are two completely different forms of art but as long as the film or TV series is true to the characters and spirit of the book it usually turns out very well. Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

    Although I have read all of Jane Austen, I am not a particular fan; I prefer her over any Bront&euml;, but far prefer Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy over the lot of them. My favorite of her novels is her last, Persuasion, so I was poised to have my high hopes dashed. But this film exceeded even elevated expectations for reasons visual, verbal-- and reverential (the marvelous Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth). Visual, first. Film adaptations of Austen (and her ilk) generally deliver a touch of grime along with glamor, but it's invariably picturesque: the tattered and torn peasants and ruffians are museum-quality. Not here. Director Roger Michel gets plain old mud on the skirts of his ladies during their long walks. Bad and/or yellow teeth abound, as they did in 1814, nowhere more notoriously than in England. Such small details are big indicators of how Michel, like Austen, prefers honest naturalism to pure aestheticism. Ivory-tower film-making is left to the likes of Merchant and Ivory. I hasten to add, however, that Michel also left the costume design to a very talented 33-year old, Alexandra Byrne, who has gone on to win an Oscar (for Elizabethan togs). Her Empire dresses and Royal navy chapeau-bras will not leave you wistful for Greer Garson wearing Adrian. As to the verbal: The screenplay perpetuates, as it must, Austen's repair to caricature for her satire. It is one of the author's failings, and it is writ large here; protagonist Anne (delicately brought to life by Amanda Root) is the only member of the Elliott family who isn't a grotesque: vain Sir Walter, strident Elizabeth, narcissistic Mary--all lack complexity, as do most of the women and many of the men. The caricatures do, however, provide comic context for the heart of the story. The number of times dutiful, plain Anne is influenced by persuasion from one buffoon or another is effectively stifling, and is therefore one of the ways in which this film adaptation truly reflects the novel. But this is cinema, not literature. Certain key moments in the film, some of them silent, reveal more than the dialog does to attentive viewers . At the shore in Lyme, all characters but two play with the sand and the surf; the two are Wentworth, who stares out at his true home, the sea, and Anne, who also simply gazes serenely out over the water toward freedom? adventure? Wentworth's true home? It sets Anne apart with lovely subtlety. Another moment occurs at the end (which returns to the opening scene, with ships), when she and Wentworth set sail. At the sight of their the full-rigged ship, I felt a tug toward freedom, too, away from all the persuasive pressures of society. Wentworth's ship, now her home too, truly did feel like independence, perhaps especially for a woman whose horizons in the early 19th century were still barbarically circumscribed.

    Firstly the good points. Beautifully filmed with authentic on location shooting in Bath and the countryside. The village scenes are straight out of an 18th Century painting. Simple and effective use of piano music as a score. The great fault is the casting of the leads. Cirian Hinds is the least romantic looking actor. He has such a fierce forbidding face suitable for character roles but totally wrong for a man in love. Amanda Root is just too plain. I know she is supposed to be bordering on old maid but she is just so insipid looking no one could carry a torch for her. There is no chemistry between them. What a waste of a good production. I don't recommend you watch this or it will spoil your image of the story.

    In this adaptation of Persuasion you get the book almost entirely verbatim. The scenery is lush and alive but at the same time dull. It represents wonderfully how our heroine Anne sees life both before and after her Captain has come home, and both before and after he wins her heart a second time. You really see how embarrassed she is upon his return, you see how much she still loves him but how she will not be the one to stand in his way of true happiness. The characters all come to life and the actors bring their own take on all of them. Any lover of Jane Austen will appreciate how well this movie was made. This is one of the best book to movie translations ever seen on screen. 9/10

    I am marking this only with a 6, mainly because of 2 things: a) The plainness of the leading actress's appearance that I know it was the director's decision. You are going to tell me that the leading man was not exactly Prince Charming... Correct! However, it was very bothering watching for two hours a supposed 26 year old young woman appearing and behaving like she is 46!!! OK, at the start of the film she was on the edge of becoming a spinster... However, near the end of the film she was more appreciated and confident and she also had two suitors literary running after her... Not even THEN could the director let the poor actress put on some make up, wear something else than those old curtains and do something with that bloody hair of hers? b) Why the director wanted every character that he wanted us to dislike TALK WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL? Anne's sister Elizabeth, her father, Ms Pain, Mary, Louisa, ALL of them are at some stage doing that. However, is was not them that I wanted to slap, but the director - that believed that having people behaving like this he would have a worthy Jane Austen novel adaptation... What's next man? Directing a Shakespeare play adaptation, where the villains defecate in frond of us? Having said all that, the performances and the overall production were OK. The story could had been told with more lively pace (=less boring), though... and Anne could had been portrayed less than a cold "Plain Jane" girl... The only time we see her laugh is when she visits that widow, and to be honest I am not very well convinced that her heart was in it :) If you ignore all these, it is actually a watchable film :))

    I absolutely loved this Persuasion, for me it is a winner both as an adaptation and on its own merits and one of my personal favourite adaptations of the books of Jane Austen. The story is beautiful and emotional, and while not always true in essence the characters are interesting and not dull. The adaptation is rather short though, but it doesn't entirely matter when it is done so well. Persuasion looks wonderful too. The costumes, locations and photography look stunning, while the piano music that accompanies the adaptation is simple and beautiful without ever being repetitive. The dialogue is sophisticated and the acting is great, complete with solid support turns from Simon Russell Beale, Susan Fleetwood, Sophie Thompson and Corin Redgrave and wonderful lead ones from Amanda Root and particularly Ciaron Hinds. In conclusion, a beautiful adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy hair, etc. Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much. The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top. Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie. Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away?? All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.

    I really enjoy period movies; I really enjoy Jane Austen stories. It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her "poor me" expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore. But I have to say it's the one thing that stuck out for me on first viewing, and I found it very distracting, and hard to identify with her because of that.

    I really enjoy period movies; I really enjoy Jane Austen stories. It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her "poor me" expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore. But I have to say it's the one thing that stuck out for me on first viewing, and I found it very distracting, and hard to identify with her because of that.

    It is hard to name another film in which every single actor is cast so well and performs so well. Even the "smallest" roles are a treat. A miracle. And watching Amanda Root reminds me of that wonderful assertion by Judi Dench: "Acting isn't what you say; it's what you don't say," --- and Amanada Root can speak volumes without a word. The Musgrove family, and their home, constitute everyone's favourite dream of English rural paradise; and at every viewing I am riveted by that fabulous carpet. Charles Musgrove is so beautifully acted --- yes, you know he is a bit of a fool and insensitive, but you love him for his heartfelt honesty and generosity. Likewise, Admiral and Mrs Croft --- the married couple everyone wishes to be. When Mrs Croft (Fiona Shaw, a genius)is regaling the dinner party with her memories of home and sea, John Woodvine, as the admiral, is visible in the background, listening quietly, not looking at her, but permitting himself an exquisite, reticent, almost humble smile of contented happiness. There is not a single weakness in this wonderful PERSUASION.

    This is one of my favourite Jane Austen dramatisations. I really like it for three reasons: 1) Amanda Root is outstandingly good as Anne Elliot. She really captures the character to perfection, and it is a hard part to act, too, since in many scenes, especially in the first half, she is simply listening to other people, and all of her emotions are conveyed by means of facial expressions and body language. 2) The musical score. So many Jane Austen adaptations use an orchestral score. This one sticks to simple piano accompaniment and it works very well indeed. 3) The supporting cast. A lot of the supporting characters really come to life, thanks to excellent ensemble playing from the likes of Susan Fleetwood as Lady Russell, Robert Glenister as Captain Harville, Fiona Shaw as Mrs Croft and Simon Russell Beale as Charles Musgrove.

    I watched this adaptation only yesterday and watched it again today. I simply fell in love with it. It is not as lively or modern as the version from 2007 which is why I like it so much. I love the pace of the story and how every frame is carefully planned. The director and producers have taken the time to really tell the story with beauty and respect. We have the time to really get to know the characters. The problem with the newer adaptations of Jane Austens works is that they almost force the story and characters upon us in the most obvious ways. There is no authenticity and natural flow. In this film we get to know Anne very well even though she is silent and drawn back throughout most of the film. That is great acting and great storytelling. What is really important to understand is that you cannot always compare the adaptations to the original source as they are two completely different forms of art but as long as the film or TV series is true to the characters and spirit of the book it usually turns out very well. Reading other reviews I am amazed that some people comment on the characters looks and appearances, saying they are not pretty enough. I think that Amanda Root does an amazing job portraying Anne. She has an inner glow and intelligence, that has died and he has lost her bloom, but it slowly comes back as the story progresses. It has nothing to do with looks and looks aren't that important. Of course the film has it's flaws. It's doesn't stay true to all the characters and the two leading actors might be a little to old but I am willing to overlook that because of their wonderful performances. Avoid the 2007 version. This is the one to watch. This is without a doubt one of the best Jane Austen adaptations out there alongside Pride & Prejudice from 1995.

    Although I have read all of Jane Austen, I am not a particular fan; I prefer her over any Bront&euml;, but far prefer Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy over the lot of them. My favorite of her novels is her last, Persuasion, so I was poised to have my high hopes dashed. But this film exceeded even elevated expectations for reasons visual, verbal-- and reverential (the marvelous Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth). Visual, first. Film adaptations of Austen (and her ilk) generally deliver a touch of grime along with glamor, but it's invariably picturesque: the tattered and torn peasants and ruffians are museum-quality. Not here. Director Roger Michel gets plain old mud on the skirts of his ladies during their long walks. Bad and/or yellow teeth abound, as they did in 1814, nowhere more notoriously than in England. Such small details are big indicators of how Michel, like Austen, prefers honest naturalism to pure aestheticism. Ivory-tower film-making is left to the likes of Merchant and Ivory. I hasten to add, however, that Michel also left the costume design to a very talented 33-year old, Alexandra Byrne, who has gone on to win an Oscar (for Elizabethan togs). Her Empire dresses and Royal navy chapeau-bras will not leave you wistful for Greer Garson wearing Adrian. As to the verbal: The screenplay perpetuates, as it must, Austen's repair to caricature for her satire. It is one of the author's failings, and it is writ large here; protagonist Anne (delicately brought to life by Amanda Root) is the only member of the Elliott family who isn't a grotesque: vain Sir Walter, strident Elizabeth, narcissistic Mary--all lack complexity, as do most of the women and many of the men. The caricatures do, however, provide comic context for the heart of the story. The number of times dutiful, plain Anne is influenced by persuasion from one buffoon or another is effectively stifling, and is therefore one of the ways in which this film adaptation truly reflects the novel. But this is cinema, not literature. Certain key moments in the film, some of them silent, reveal more than the dialog does to attentive viewers . At the shore in Lyme, all characters but two play with the sand and the surf; the two are Wentworth, who stares out at his true home, the sea, and Anne, who also simply gazes serenely out over the water toward freedom? adventure? Wentworth's true home? It sets Anne apart with lovely subtlety. Another moment occurs at the end (which returns to the opening scene, with ships), when she and Wentworth set sail. At the sight of their the full-rigged ship, I felt a tug toward freedom, too, away from all the persuasive pressures of society. Wentworth's ship, now her home too, truly did feel like independence, perhaps especially for a woman whose horizons in the early 19th century were still barbarically circumscribed.

    Firstly the good points. Beautifully filmed with authentic on location shooting in Bath and the countryside. The village scenes are straight out of an 18th Century painting. Simple and effective use of piano music as a score. The great fault is the casting of the leads. Cirian Hinds is the least romantic looking actor. He has such a fierce forbidding face suitable for character roles but totally wrong for a man in love. Amanda Root is just too plain. I know she is supposed to be bordering on old maid but she is just so insipid looking no one could carry a torch for her. There is no chemistry between them. What a waste of a good production. I don't recommend you watch this or it will spoil your image of the story.

    In this adaptation of Persuasion you get the book almost entirely verbatim. The scenery is lush and alive but at the same time dull. It represents wonderfully how our heroine Anne sees life both before and after her Captain has come home, and both before and after he wins her heart a second time. You really see how embarrassed she is upon his return, you see how much she still loves him but how she will not be the one to stand in his way of true happiness. The characters all come to life and the actors bring their own take on all of them. Any lover of Jane Austen will appreciate how well this movie was made. This is one of the best book to movie translations ever seen on screen. 9/10

    I am marking this only with a 6, mainly because of 2 things: a) The plainness of the leading actress's appearance that I know it was the director's decision. You are going to tell me that the leading man was not exactly Prince Charming... Correct! However, it was very bothering watching for two hours a supposed 26 year old young woman appearing and behaving like she is 46!!! OK, at the start of the film she was on the edge of becoming a spinster... However, near the end of the film she was more appreciated and confident and she also had two suitors literary running after her... Not even THEN could the director let the poor actress put on some make up, wear something else than those old curtains and do something with that bloody hair of hers? b) Why the director wanted every character that he wanted us to dislike TALK WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL? Anne's sister Elizabeth, her father, Ms Pain, Mary, Louisa, ALL of them are at some stage doing that. However, is was not them that I wanted to slap, but the director - that believed that having people behaving like this he would have a worthy Jane Austen novel adaptation... What's next man? Directing a Shakespeare play adaptation, where the villains defecate in frond of us? Having said all that, the performances and the overall production were OK. The story could had been told with more lively pace (=less boring), though... and Anne could had been portrayed less than a cold "Plain Jane" girl... The only time we see her laugh is when she visits that widow, and to be honest I am not very well convinced that her heart was in it :) If you ignore all these, it is actually a watchable film :))

    I absolutely loved this Persuasion, for me it is a winner both as an adaptation and on its own merits and one of my personal favourite adaptations of the books of Jane Austen. The story is beautiful and emotional, and while not always true in essence the characters are interesting and not dull. The adaptation is rather short though, but it doesn't entirely matter when it is done so well. Persuasion looks wonderful too. The costumes, locations and photography look stunning, while the piano music that accompanies the adaptation is simple and beautiful without ever being repetitive. The dialogue is sophisticated and the acting is great, complete with solid support turns from Simon Russell Beale, Susan Fleetwood, Sophie Thompson and Corin Redgrave and wonderful lead ones from Amanda Root and particularly Ciaron Hinds. In conclusion, a beautiful adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy hair, etc. Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much. The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top. Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie. Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away?? All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.
