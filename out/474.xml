  An insane general starts a process to nuclear holocaust that a war room of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Paranoid Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper of Burpelson Air Force Base, he believing that fluoridation of the American water supply is a Soviet plot to poison the U.S. populace, is able to deploy through a back door mechanism a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, including the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Buck Turgidson, and President Merkin Muffley. Only Ripper knows the code to recall the B-52 bombers and he has shut down communication in and out of Burpelson as a measure to protect this attack. Ripper's executive officer, RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (on exchange from Britain), who is being held at Burpelson by Ripper, believes he knows the recall codes if he can only get a message to the outside world. Meanwhile at the Pentagon War Room, key persons including Muffley, Turgidson and nuclear scientist and adviser, a former Nazi named Dr. Strangelove, are discussing measures to stop the attack or mitigate its blow-up into an ...

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat.

Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake.

Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated.

The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case.

It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic.

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces.

Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie.

And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.

    Stanley Kubrick's "dark nightmare" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. "King" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col."Bat" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general "Buck" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!

    General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated. In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack. Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest. Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me. There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing. Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like "Try A Little Tenderness" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while "We'll Meet Again" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece. For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

    Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10 Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax...

    I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies. I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have. The acting was decent and the music was not bad. It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it. The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10

    Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are "contaminating his precious bodily fluids", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the "Ruskies". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake  a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove  the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic.

The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.

    Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange", I still gave "Dr. Strangelove" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that "All About Steve" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick.

    There's one film from the 1960's that takes a peculiar stance on politics, and presents it in a way that some would not normally find humorous, but still remains a hysterical film. Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams "What if" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy. When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive "Doomsday Machine" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action. The theme of this movie takes after the whole "paranoia style", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness.

    I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable. As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other. Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian. The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me.

    I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant. I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny. I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.

    My Favorite Movie of All-Time

    This is my favorite movie of all-time. Stanley Kubrick takes a remarkably grim scenario (total annihilation through nuclear war) and turns it into the greatest comedy ever made. It's tremendously shot, incredibly acted, and most importantly... really, really funny. Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper thinks his impotence is the result of a Soviet conspiracy to "sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids" through water fluoridation and decides to launch an all out nuclear assault on the Commies. As Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (a British officer who is in America as part of the officer exchange program) tries to convince Ripper to call back the planes, President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Buck Turgidson, and the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi physicist) gather in the War Room to try and resolve the situation. Hilarity ensues. I find myself quoting lines from this film all the time. "Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water?" "You can't fight in here this is the war room." "Mien Fuhrer, I can walk!" Just look at the quotes page they're all there. And nothing's better than Major Kong riding the bomb down and seeing the nuclear explosions while "We'll Meet Again" is playing. Sellers gives one of the all-time great comedic performances as Muffley, Mandrake, and Strangelove. Everything he does in this film makes me laugh. My favorite bit is as Strangelove he's constantly trying to keep himself from giving a Nazi salute. George C. Scott is equally hilarious as Buck even though he was somewhat tricked into giving the performance he gave. This is just my perfect movie. I've always been interested in the Cold War and the idea of nuclear combat, and so it just doesn't get any better than a hilarious movie that perfectly captures the tone of the times. 10/10
