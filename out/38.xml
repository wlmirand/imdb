    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    This movie i feel gets a bit of a harsh score by critics here,there are plenty of action sequences and the idea of cyber terrorism is a genuine threat if not even more so today as it was upon this movies release,so with the thrill of chases and evasion with a tense build up to the finale,well then it does not disappoint for a movie with a release date of 1995,it is still one of Sandra Bullock's greatest performances and makes a change from her comical/love story genre movies.Jeremy Northam plays a great bad guy, very cool and collected and charming yet cruel and heartless simultaneously,the gadgetry and the cat and mouse between characters is great.It's a must for computer enthusiasts,it's no The Matrix but it is most definitely worth the watch,i'd like to watch it in blu ray format some time as it would benefit greatly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    This movie i feel gets a bit of a harsh score by critics here,there are plenty of action sequences and the idea of cyber terrorism is a genuine threat if not even more so today as it was upon this movies release,so with the thrill of chases and evasion with a tense build up to the finale,well then it does not disappoint for a movie with a release date of 1995,it is still one of Sandra Bullock's greatest performances and makes a change from her comical/love story genre movies.Jeremy Northam plays a great bad guy, very cool and collected and charming yet cruel and heartless simultaneously,the gadgetry and the cat and mouse between characters is great.It's a must for computer enthusiasts,it's no The Matrix but it is most definitely worth the watch,i'd like to watch it in blu ray format some time as it would benefit greatly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    This movie i feel gets a bit of a harsh score by critics here,there are plenty of action sequences and the idea of cyber terrorism is a genuine threat if not even more so today as it was upon this movies release,so with the thrill of chases and evasion with a tense build up to the finale,well then it does not disappoint for a movie with a release date of 1995,it is still one of Sandra Bullock's greatest performances and makes a change from her comical/love story genre movies.Jeremy Northam plays a great bad guy, very cool and collected and charming yet cruel and heartless simultaneously,the gadgetry and the cat and mouse between characters is great.It's a must for computer enthusiasts,it's no The Matrix but it is most definitely worth the watch,i'd like to watch it in blu ray format some time as it would benefit greatly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty.

That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    This movie i feel gets a bit of a harsh score by critics here,there are plenty of action sequences and the idea of cyber terrorism is a genuine threat if not even more so today as it was upon this movies release,so with the thrill of chases and evasion with a tense build up to the finale,well then it does not disappoint for a movie with a release date of 1995,it is still one of Sandra Bullock's greatest performances and makes a change from her comical/love story genre movies.Jeremy Northam plays a great bad guy, very cool and collected and charming yet cruel and heartless simultaneously,the gadgetry and the cat and mouse between characters is great.It's a must for computer enthusiasts,it's no The Matrix but it is most definitely worth the watch,i'd like to watch it in blu ray format some time as it would benefit greatly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net."

Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

    "Angela Bennett" (Sandra Bullock) is a computer nerd who makes a living working from home on-line for a computer services company called "Cathedral". One of her tasks is to take infected systems and repair them for both companies and individuals alike. One day she gets a call from her point of contact at Cathedral who asks her to look into a possible data flaw within a security system called "Gateway" which allows certain people to obtain complete access into corporate and government data banks and computer systems. What she doesn't realize is just how serious and lethal these people are. And they mean business. Anyway, this film is an excellent example of a movie that was good when it first came out but because it relies upon outdated technology seems quite dated now. Personally, I thought Sandra Bullock performed quite well and even though the film doesn't age well, I still find it enjoyable. Most people who saw it when it first came out will probably understand and I have rated it accordingly.

    Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with "The Net." Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on "The Net." She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and "the best pizza in cyberspace" and sending "electronic mail" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie. And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say. Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life. There's some good action; and some rather clich&eacute; "chase" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the "best pizza in cyberspace" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her. So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)

    This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the "horse and buggy" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer.

    Okay, firstly I like Sandra Bullock anyway, but do admit she is not often lost in her characters and plays herself. She often plays slightly socially awkward characters however, she's believable, every-girl, and relatable and necessarily not too contrived especially in a storyline where you have to believe its happening and get involved. Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable. Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s. This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example. Note the policeman reading the Miranda rights off a piece of paper - was this filmed around the time they had changed? Historically interesting watching it (again) now, in 2013. A good, entertaining film in a similar vein as The Pelican Brief - intelligent writing and not predictable.

    Angela Bennett is a computer expert. The young and beautiful analyst is never far from a computer and modem. The only activity she has outside of computers is visiting her mother. A friend, whom she's only spoken to over the net and phone, Dale Hessman, sent her a program with a weird glitch for her to de-bug. That night, he left to meet her and was killed in a plane crash. Angela discovers secret information on the disk she has received only hours before she leaves for vacation. Her life then turns into a nightmare, her records are erased from existence and she is given a new identity, one with a police record. She struggles to find out why this has happened and who has it in for her.... For some reason, after Speed, Bullock was given this car crash as her first starring vehicle. It was probably because Roberts and Steerp had moderate success with the pelican brief and the river wild respectively, but she hadn't held a film on her one, and this was a bad place to start. Firstly, this sort of film would obviously age badly, but unlike War Games, it doesn't have that camp value. It just consists of Bullock getting herself into scrape after scrape, and trying to avoid staggering plot holes. Secondly, as someone from the UK, it really irked me to see the Englishman with the posh accent as the bad guy. As soon as the guy opened his mouth, I knew he was the main bad guy, and he would die in some pathetic way. These films were rife in the nineties, and this avoided straight to video, simply because it was a starting vehicle for a very good actress. Luckily for her she has great charisma, and survived this mess. Seriously, the direct to DVD sequel is better.

    Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then "the net" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web. I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich&eacute;s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well. There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role. I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

    This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too.

    The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

    I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the "killers" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this "killer" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.
