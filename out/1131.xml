 <sinopse>
  An affluent and unexceptional homemaker in the suburbs develops multiple chemical sensitivity.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "Safe" has been described as a horror movie of the soul, a description that director Todd Haynes relishes. California housewife Carol White seems to have it all in life: a wealthy husband and a beautiful house. The only thing she lacks is a strong personality: Carol seems timid and empty during all of her interactions with the world around her. At the beginning of the film, one would consider her to be more safe in life than just about anyone. That doesn't turn out to be the case. Starting with headaches and leading to a grand-mal seizure, Carol becomes more and more sick, claiming that she's become sensitive to the common toxins in today's world: exhaust, fumes, aerosol spray, etc. She pulls back from the sexual advances of her husband and spends her nights alone by the TV or wandering around the outside of her well-protected home like an animal in a cage. Her physician examines her and can find nothing wrong. An allergist finds that she has an allergic reaction to milk but explains ...

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

    Todd Haynes' Safe starts off as the chronicle of the life of a bourgeois housewife from the 1980s. She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

She seems a bit repressed by her frequently overbearing husband and her interactions with others never progress beyond rote banalities. She has no personality to speak of, in fact she seems almost incapable of acting of her own accord. Eventually she develops an illness which is so foreign to her doctor that he suggests a psychiatrist. It seems that she has grown so dissatisfied with her empty life at a subconscious level that she begins to physically manifest this dissatisfaction. The woman begins to search for a way to overcome her new condition, or at the very least to find some way to explain it. She eventually falls in with a group of people who claim to be sick due to an inability to cope with the chemicals that the modern lifestyle has released into the environment. Her condition worsens as she heads to an isolated commune where other rich people with equally enigmatic maladies gather to convalesce. This commune is led by an incredibly wealthy man who claims to be terminally ill and explains that the only way for his clients to improve their condition is to learn to love themselves. The film doesn't take a stance as to whether the protagonist's condition is caused by her physical environment or her lack of mental stimulation. It is critical of the society that claims to have all the answers for her, however, as everybody she encounters seems to have a plan to heal her but they succeed only in worsening her condition and decreasing the size of her living space. Haynes milks the ambiguity of the situation for his unusual narrative as his languid pace calls to mind the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, that Italian poet of ennui. Although Haynes does an adequate job technically and even manages to create some memorable images, he never manages to capture the zeitgeist the way Antonioni's best work did, nor does he combine that well worn style with any unique personal touches the way other Antonioni-influenced auteurs such as Wong Kar-Wai or Tsai Ming-liang did at around the same time. Safe manages to make its points fairly well in spite of its lack of originality and the sense of narrative bloat toward the end, making it a decent but non-essential film.

    Todd Haynes's Safe is married to its era's increased awareness of plastic toxicity: where the world had once embraced plastics as miraculous new wondersubstance, its environmental implications were at last coming to the forefront. There is tension, however, in the toxicity of plastic's chemical origins and the sterility promised in its final form: overwhelmed by the omnipresence of invisible chemical fumes, protagonist Carol White finds refuge in a plastic oxygen mask. The irony of her reliance on plastics mirrors her relationship to larger systems of oppression in the film: in escaping her claustrophobically prescriptive suburban life, she finds even greater claustrophobia and restriction on her anti-chemical reservation; she must strain herself to find the new environment any sort of improvement. The film offers a clever commentary on our relationship to the social systems above us, and comes recommended in spite of its occasional intentional dullness. TK 11/11/10

    Made with the kind of analytic intelligence that was the signature of Stanley Kubrick, but also with a tenderness that Kubrick seldom permitted, Safe is an intellectual horror film. Carol (Julianne Moore) is afflicted with environmental illness. It is a syndrome which many in the medical establishment refuse to recognize; those who do consider its sufferers, most of them women, to be the canaries of the 21st century. Keeping Carol at a distance - a fragile, almost paralysed figure in a chill, repressive environment - director Todd Haynes nevertheless locates the film within her subjectivity. Rather than alienating us from her, the measured, wide-angle, hyper-real mise-en-scene becomes an expression of the alienation she experiences. As her health deteriorates, we realize that everything in her environment - which is not very different from our own - is potentially lethal. The tension between identification and remove gives the film great gravity. Every frame seems charged with the push-pull of desire and loathing. Safe has the most conventional surface of all Haynes's films, but it makes the greatest demand on viewers. It would be wrong to look for the film's meaning in the words of the affable guru of Wrenwood. Nothing could be further from Haynes's position than the New Age prescriptions. 'Do you smell the fumes?' is the inscription on a flyer that catches Carol's eye. Safe suggests that we are all vulnerable to the fumes; the rest is up to us.

    I had heard the title and seen the poster for this poster a few times, and I knew the leading actress and that it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it, from director Todd Haynes (Far from Heaven, I'm Not There.). Basically, set in 1987 in a prosperous neighbourhood of the San Fernando Valley, homemaker Carol White (Julianne Moore) has a seemingly unremarkable life, but then she develops a chronic medical condition, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS, or the "Twentieth-Century Disease"), and she experiences many severe non-specific symptoms that she believes are triggered by everyday household and industrial products. She passes her days with gardening, taking clothes to the dry cleaners, attending aerobics classes and various other activities, and her marriage to husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) is stable but lacking emotional or sexual intimacy, and her husband has a son from a previous marriage who lives with them, and she only has distant friends. She goes about her days with her normal routine, and then she develops this unpredictable and unusual bodily reactions to things, such as persistent mental exertion, coughing uncontrollably (with truck exhausts around), symptoms of asthma, nose bleeding, vomiting and involuntary muscular convulsions. The doctors only conclude that she has an allergy to milk, which she drinks regularly without consequence, but they do not have a clue of her other symptoms, and they have no help to cope or cure her, so she decides to attend psychotherapy sessions, which do not give her any better answers of her condition. She then sees an advertisement at her community centre for a New Age/religious retreat in the desert called Wrenwood which is designed to bring people together and help them overcome and cure themselves from suffering MCS, in various ways, mostly group sessions, headed by phony but "sensitive" Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman), and by the end this does seemingly work well enough for her to return home. Also starring Kate McGregor-Stewart as Claire, Mary Carver as Nell, Susan Norman as Linda, Steven Gilborn as Dr. Hubbard, Ronnie Farer as Barbara, James LeGros as Chris and Jodie Markell as Anita. Moore is very interesting as she slowly breaks down due to the many elements of the modern world, the plot of a person becoming ill with almost no reason or circumstance at all is intriguing, I admit the pace is a little slow, but the claustrophobic, psychological and haunting "monster movie without a monster" feel makes for a watchable drama. Very good!

    One of the most important figures of modern independent American cinema, Todd Haynes is widely known mostly for his music-based projects ( ''Velvet Goldmine'', ''I'm not there'', ''Superstar : the Karen Carpenter story'' and the videoclip for Sonic Youth's ''Disappearer'' ). But it's 1995's ''Safe'' that, although not related to music ( except for the amazing soundtrack ), stands out as his greatest work by far - and that is because it proves once more something that seems paradox at first glance : that the most ''anti-American'' culture that we've known so far, is the American culture itself. Carol White ( Julianne Moore in the greatest moment of her multifarious career ) is a bourgeois housewife that leads a peaceful and safe ( motif that obviously repeats itself several times throughout the film ) life with her husband and her adopted son in their luxurious house. Her daily routine is limited to aerobic classes, choosing the right color for the new sofa and having healthy meals with the rest of the good housewives - her friends. While the story unfolds she goes through some crises that look like epileptic and she starts believing more and more that its due to the effects of the environmental disaster, like the infected air she breathes in the city, or the chemical products she consumes on daily basis - and that's enough with the synopsis cause I already gave away a lot. Judging from all the above, someone would imagine that this is just a film with eco-friendly messages and indeed, this is the impression that the viewer gets around halfway through the film. Sure, the emotional emptiness of her family routine and her materialistic way of life has been made clear so far, but until then her emotional crisis doesn't seem to connect to the environmental crisis in any convincing way. The viewer is trying to connect the pieces, completely unsuspected about what's coming up next - and be sure that it's going to shake and flutter you like few other movies do. The ideology that dominates the world right now, not only in the US of course but globally, has too many aspects and the environmental crisis is only a small part of its effects in the social life - also in the film, it's going to be proved that the ecological extension is just an excuse. What really matters here is the basis upon which this ideology is build, meaning everything that feeds it and promotes on a daily basis ''from below'' : the path of individualism and family alienation from society create the need for safety from everything that threats to shake the peaceful life of the proud ''civilian'' - and that's exactly what Carol is. A low-profile, exemplary, law-abiding citizen that minds her own business and that once in a while ''breaks'' the routine by drinking tea with lemon at her friends' or trying a perm for a change. However, she's completely helpless fulfilling her need for emotional contact and, in what seems a huge step for her from what we've known so far, she decides to change her way of life drastically. Convinced that the root of all her problems is the exhaust gas of the big city, she cages herself in an even more limited environment, a strictly closed society that promises peace and serenity to her. ''We are safe, and all is well in our world'' teaches the new ''alternative'' mentor and he warns her that she is the sole responsible for everything that spoils her peace - and that is because ''she doesn't love herself too much''. Carol is willing to believe anything to find a cure, but her new cage is as deadlock as the previous one, only this time human contact is restricted by rules. The shockingly ironic last scene still haunts me every time I walk alone in the dark.

    One of the greatest film I've seen for the past few years about the acceptance of oneself. I'm not sure the question is to know whether she has aids. As edorapetrafiesa perfectly said in lower discussion, she became to be allergic to the whole world. And even more to herself. I guess she couldn't stand the person her entourage asked her to become. Her lack of self confidence from a long time coming from former failed relationship (this is not her child implying that regarding her age, it's not her first husband neither) + her desire to control the least detail of her life and you have a perfect cocktail of burn out and depression. No doubt anyway this movie is about Aids and the way the illness was perceived in the eighties. A perfect mirror movie to understand why and how sometimes we locked ourselves into social plays and the consequences for those who don't master the rules (personnally I haven't :)

    How to exemplify that Reagan's sun when he promised morning again in America was really a toxic sun, toxic for the soul, this is all the foreground you're going to need here. The film opens in '87, three years after that promise, in a sunny suburb somewhere in south California, and it's reasonable to assume this couple, with their spacious home, their well-kept garden, their ample free time, is one of many who were soothed by that promise, the promise to have a Dream, into a kind of comfortable sleep. Todd Haynes has the benefit of building upon Lynch, which is to say the option of discarding in hindsight the sexual darkness of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film opens to that effect with the woman having bland, passionless sex. This is how far sleep has numbed the senses, even desire is deadened and the nightmare has diffused into the very air itself, the smoggy air of Los Angeles. This is given to us as the woman developing some sort of allergic response to her surroundings, but the point is that we cannot know where evil is flowing from into the world, we just can't. Is it car fumes, the hair-dresser's chemicals, something off the new teal sofa they have ordered? Or is the mind conjuring the illness as the desperate means of making known the extent of the damage inside? Is it stifled instincts, stifled for too long? The point remains though, that life keeps breaking down on us and for no apparent reason, this satisfied life that should have been alright. Observant viewers will be able to link her response with the barely audible static on the soundtrack that continuously hums beneath dull day-to-day life. It is the mind humming to some malevolent tune of the fabricated world. This is taken to be resolved in a remote New-Age commune, out in the clear air somewhere in the countryside. Now we've been accustomed, ever since the Beatles traipsed all the way to India to be scammed by spiritual gurus, to view this sort of therapy as fundamentally crooked, but the leader gives some solid advice; quiet mind, beauty cultivated inside, clarity, all that Japanese gardening for the soul. At the same time, he advocates an almost paranoid retreat from the world, is complacent and satisfied, and we're shown his luxurious house that overlooks the otherwise spartan retreat. No, something is wrong here as well, and the filmmaker is smart enough to barely hint at merely another kind of toxic environment that sells peace of mind. Now so far the film's power is rhythm and pulse from the heart of this woman as she tries to cope with it herself; slow, dissipating, tiredness, plus ambiguous response to unsatisfactory reality. The husband is bland and selfish but is not a caricature, which would have significantly cheapened the thing. Nothing has been really subtle but evokes its own time and space. You have to wait till the end for the formative mechanism that gives rise to this clouded mind, the masterful touch is all Julianne's and carried alone before a mirror. Of course each patient has given his own reasons for his illness, but this one we have followed close. She finally encounters her own mirror image in that artificial womb of a room, and does she look at a real self looking to see a real image, warts and all, or does she soothe herself with another dream, another promise for morning again? This is the thing that got the ball rolling, ever since Reagan's ad one morning on TV; it would all be alright, you just had to trust someone else. Julianne Moore completely erases any presence of herself in the process, truly outstanding work.

    I saw this the other day and had high hopes, having seen Far from Heaven featuring Julianne Moore which was a stunning film. On a positive note I thought it was beautifully shot and well acted. The 1980's setting was bang on, the clothes, colours and texture of the movie as accurate a picture of the decade as I've seen on film. I loved the soundtrack, reminded me of the first Terminator film. I have real problems with the narrative here, mainly because early on the film hints at something insidious or dark to come. This drives you along but unfortunately it becomes a little 'Channel 5 afternoon movie', American films about domestic dramas. The ending is a real let down..no spoiler here but it's almost as if the studio insisted on coming up with a credible reason for her ailment and the movie loses it's power.

    I'm a devoted Moore fan, so how could I miss this highly-acclaimed indie film, which directed by the genius Todd Haynes in 1995 and also bestowed her the crown of Queen of indies. SAFE is an unorthodox indiewood member who has a unflinching core which dares to chart the mysterious battle between the body and soul through the dubbed "environmental disease". The concept here is an intrepid self-salvation process, in a world without any certainty, it is what we believe decides our fate, any physical phenomenons have lost all its gauges and canons. A striking truth is that nothing can save a troubled soul. I do find stark pessimism in the film, and which is scarier is that it plunges a tremendous impact on me, which in turn solidifies my brief and proves that certain films could unswervingly employ this sort of manipulative trickery. Moore is laboriously stunning for her role, a delicate doll with a determined will to pursue the cure of her unknown disease, a subtle yet multi-layered interpretation, which reminds me of a saying that "a lonely person should be disgraceful", until she eventually found the place where existed her idem genus. In the very end, she just cannot go back to her normal social life and only could survive by shielding herself inside a new egg-shaped "clean" room where she can dwell in forever. I consider the film as a modern-day allegory, it challenges its audience to face a wretched circumstance - the insecurity of our carnal figure and the lost identity of any classification. In my opinion, the gritty singularity of ourselves is the cradle of the evil side of religion, one of mine catchphrases is that: Don't be swayed easily by those around you, by what you hear and what they say; adjust yourself in a placid mode, the one who knows you best is yourself, and is yourself only. Technically speaking, the film deploys a post-apocalypse palette and a brittle score to embody an almost horrorfest-like shtick, Todd Haynes is an authentic auteur who has gut to surprise his devotees.

    Well what can I say. Julianne Moore is superb as Carol White. I don't know if I should say too much about this film, because essentially you will interpret this based on your own feelings and opinion depending on what you received from this film. To me, this is a film about a woman who becomes ultra sensitive to the world around her in terms of chemicals and starts having seizures and all sorts of symptoms. But what the film is also trying to say is how the plastic life one can lead can sort of make yourself distant from who you are and what you really enjoy. The fakeness that can sometimes surround you and the purpose of your life can be questioned at many times in your life. This isn't a film for everyone and I know if I recommended this film to some of my friends, they would watch it and then say to me 'What the hell was the point of this film?' This film does move at a somewhat slow and subtle pace in that you aren't given all the answers, and in fact you really aren't given any answers, but rather things to think about so you can discuss what is happening to this character. I was actually expecting the film to go down a typical path in the third act in that there is more to this than what it seems, but I was pleasantly surprised in that it strayed away from that thriller convention and gave us what the film has carried all the way through. You really just have to see it to understand it. Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened. Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance. This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.
