  Plasticine animation of Wallace and Gromit, inventors of all manner of useful devices. Gromit (a dog) finds himself being pushed out of his room and home by a new lodger who is actually a ruthless criminal (and a small penguin). The penguin is planning a robbery and needs to use Wallace and his mechanical remote controlled trousers to pull off the raid. However, Gromit is wise to the penguin and comes to the rescue.

    This little gem has its 20th birthday this year and man has it aged fine. While Wallace serves mostly as a tool (in the truest sense of the word), it's all about the face-off between Gromit and a criminal mastermind. It starts off with Gromit receiving the most curious birthday gift: a pair of remote-controlled mechanical trousers to take him out for a walk, so Wallace can stay at home and do whatever he likes. (Whose birthday is it anyway???) Neither particularly interested in the trousers, nor in being kept on a leash, Gromit just enjoys the day out. Upon return home, he finds Wallace having rented a room to a penguin named Feathers McGraw. This one quickly expresses much more interest in the new trousers than the actual presentee. Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen. Here it was particularly nice to see him screaming not for his canine pal and not for his feathered "friend", with whom he bonded increasingly early on on Gromit's expense. This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason. As of now, it's my favorite W&G piece (mainly because of one of the finest villain performances in animation history) and everybody should see it.

    Wallace (Peter Sallis) is used by a shady, criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers. Nick Park has said this was his favorite of the Wallace and Gromit films, and I have to agree with him. Whether I have seen all of them or not is not clear to me, but of those I have, this one definitely stands out as the masterwork -- how do you top a villain played by a shady, snaky penguin? The animation is incredible, especially when we see the way the outside of the buildings are crafted. The clay of the main characters may be relatively simplistic, but this is not because the animators lack talent.

    The Wrong Trousers is directed by Nick Park who also co-writes the story with Bob Baker. Out of Aardman Animations and featuring the voice of Peter Sallis, the story sees Wallace & Gromit up to their necks in trouble when they take in a mysterious penguin lodger. The second animated feature outing for Wallace & Gromit is that type of animated feature that the kids roar at and the adults nod appreciatively towards. With its low key sense of humour, crime movie homage and scorching attention to detail, it's as good as claymation gets. Structured in simple three tier movie format, Park enjoys dallying with noir like visuals as Julian Nott's music rumbles away like it was a Karloff movie. Then it's into the final quarter where the story hits its menacing peak and Park unleashes a thrilling finale as our illustrious Northerners hurtle around the house on a model train. Brilliant. 9/10

    Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!

    Wallace and gromit have had some amazing great adventures with some of the best short films ever! This just reaches No.1 of there best even if a grand day out and a close shave are masterpieces of their own. The story is well done with the most funniest animated villain in years (my opinion) and really good claymation (the rain is top notch and were talking about clay) its just great! The humour is really improved from a grand day out not because the previous short was not funny but this got me choking at one point. Some of the best humour but what surprises me is the sadness with the scene with gromit running away I recommend this one the most, I would hate someone who hates it but It would be worse if you never seen it. It got the mood and drama perfect A MUST!!!!!

    Again brilliantly animated with all the little subtle touches that make Aardman films so great! Of course Peter Sallis does his usual excellent job of voicing Wallace. The plot is more complicated than the first film and it shows the ambition of the studio to progress. Some of the ideas are really crazy, but they work so well in this medium. For me, not quite as good as 'A Grand Day Out', but a very close second HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 27,036 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 25 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 19,727 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10

Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10

    This little gem has its 20th birthday this year and man has it aged fine. While Wallace serves mostly as a tool (in the truest sense of the word), it's all about the face-off between Gromit and a criminal mastermind. It starts off with Gromit receiving the most curious birthday gift: a pair of remote-controlled mechanical trousers to take him out for a walk, so Wallace can stay at home and do whatever he likes. (Whose birthday is it anyway???) Neither particularly interested in the trousers, nor in being kept on a leash, Gromit just enjoys the day out. Upon return home, he finds Wallace having rented a room to a penguin named Feathers McGraw. This one quickly expresses much more interest in the new trousers than the actual presentee. Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen. Here it was particularly nice to see him screaming not for his canine pal and not for his feathered "friend", with whom he bonded increasingly early on on Gromit's expense. This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason. As of now, it's my favorite W&G piece (mainly because of one of the finest villain performances in animation history) and everybody should see it.

    Wallace (Peter Sallis) is used by a shady, criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers. Nick Park has said this was his favorite of the Wallace and Gromit films, and I have to agree with him. Whether I have seen all of them or not is not clear to me, but of those I have, this one definitely stands out as the masterwork -- how do you top a villain played by a shady, snaky penguin? The animation is incredible, especially when we see the way the outside of the buildings are crafted. The clay of the main characters may be relatively simplistic, but this is not because the animators lack talent.

    The Wrong Trousers is directed by Nick Park who also co-writes the story with Bob Baker. Out of Aardman Animations and featuring the voice of Peter Sallis, the story sees Wallace & Gromit up to their necks in trouble when they take in a mysterious penguin lodger. The second animated feature outing for Wallace & Gromit is that type of animated feature that the kids roar at and the adults nod appreciatively towards. With its low key sense of humour, crime movie homage and scorching attention to detail, it's as good as claymation gets. Structured in simple three tier movie format, Park enjoys dallying with noir like visuals as Julian Nott's music rumbles away like it was a Karloff movie. Then it's into the final quarter where the story hits its menacing peak and Park unleashes a thrilling finale as our illustrious Northerners hurtle around the house on a model train. Brilliant. 9/10

    Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!

    Wallace and gromit have had some amazing great adventures with some of the best short films ever! This just reaches No.1 of there best even if a grand day out and a close shave are masterpieces of their own. The story is well done with the most funniest animated villain in years (my opinion) and really good claymation (the rain is top notch and were talking about clay) its just great! The humour is really improved from a grand day out not because the previous short was not funny but this got me choking at one point. Some of the best humour but what surprises me is the sadness with the scene with gromit running away I recommend this one the most, I would hate someone who hates it but It would be worse if you never seen it. It got the mood and drama perfect A MUST!!!!!

    Again brilliantly animated with all the little subtle touches that make Aardman films so great! Of course Peter Sallis does his usual excellent job of voicing Wallace. The plot is more complicated than the first film and it shows the ambition of the studio to progress. Some of the ideas are really crazy, but they work so well in this medium. For me, not quite as good as 'A Grand Day Out', but a very close second HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 27,036 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 25 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 19,727 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas.

Some of the best humour but what surprises me is the sadness with the scene with gromit running away I recommend this one the most, I would hate someone who hates it but It would be worse if you never seen it. It got the mood and drama perfect A MUST!!!!!

    Again brilliantly animated with all the little subtle touches that make Aardman films so great! Of course Peter Sallis does his usual excellent job of voicing Wallace. The plot is more complicated than the first film and it shows the ambition of the studio to progress. Some of the ideas are really crazy, but they work so well in this medium. For me, not quite as good as 'A Grand Day Out', but a very close second HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 27,036 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 25 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 19,727 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10

    This little gem has its 20th birthday this year and man has it aged fine. While Wallace serves mostly as a tool (in the truest sense of the word), it's all about the face-off between Gromit and a criminal mastermind. It starts off with Gromit receiving the most curious birthday gift: a pair of remote-controlled mechanical trousers to take him out for a walk, so Wallace can stay at home and do whatever he likes. (Whose birthday is it anyway???) Neither particularly interested in the trousers, nor in being kept on a leash, Gromit just enjoys the day out. Upon return home, he finds Wallace having rented a room to a penguin named Feathers McGraw. This one quickly expresses much more interest in the new trousers than the actual presentee. Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen. Here it was particularly nice to see him screaming not for his canine pal and not for his feathered "friend", with whom he bonded increasingly early on on Gromit's expense. This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason. As of now, it's my favorite W&G piece (mainly because of one of the finest villain performances in animation history) and everybody should see it.

    Wallace (Peter Sallis) is used by a shady, criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers. Nick Park has said this was his favorite of the Wallace and Gromit films, and I have to agree with him. Whether I have seen all of them or not is not clear to me, but of those I have, this one definitely stands out as the masterwork -- how do you top a villain played by a shady, snaky penguin? The animation is incredible, especially when we see the way the outside of the buildings are crafted. The clay of the main characters may be relatively simplistic, but this is not because the animators lack talent.

    The Wrong Trousers is directed by Nick Park who also co-writes the story with Bob Baker. Out of Aardman Animations and featuring the voice of Peter Sallis, the story sees Wallace & Gromit up to their necks in trouble when they take in a mysterious penguin lodger. The second animated feature outing for Wallace & Gromit is that type of animated feature that the kids roar at and the adults nod appreciatively towards. With its low key sense of humour, crime movie homage and scorching attention to detail, it's as good as claymation gets. Structured in simple three tier movie format, Park enjoys dallying with noir like visuals as Julian Nott's music rumbles away like it was a Karloff movie. Then it's into the final quarter where the story hits its menacing peak and Park unleashes a thrilling finale as our illustrious Northerners hurtle around the house on a model train. Brilliant. 9/10

    Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!

Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen. Here it was particularly nice to see him screaming not for his canine pal and not for his feathered "friend", with whom he bonded increasingly early on on Gromit's expense. This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason. As of now, it's my favorite W&G piece (mainly because of one of the finest villain performances in animation history) and everybody should see it.

    Wallace (Peter Sallis) is used by a shady, criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers. Nick Park has said this was his favorite of the Wallace and Gromit films, and I have to agree with him. Whether I have seen all of them or not is not clear to me, but of those I have, this one definitely stands out as the masterwork -- how do you top a villain played by a shady, snaky penguin? The animation is incredible, especially when we see the way the outside of the buildings are crafted. The clay of the main characters may be relatively simplistic, but this is not because the animators lack talent.

    The Wrong Trousers is directed by Nick Park who also co-writes the story with Bob Baker. Out of Aardman Animations and featuring the voice of Peter Sallis, the story sees Wallace & Gromit up to their necks in trouble when they take in a mysterious penguin lodger. The second animated feature outing for Wallace & Gromit is that type of animated feature that the kids roar at and the adults nod appreciatively towards. With its low key sense of humour, crime movie homage and scorching attention to detail, it's as good as claymation gets. Structured in simple three tier movie format, Park enjoys dallying with noir like visuals as Julian Nott's music rumbles away like it was a Karloff movie. Then it's into the final quarter where the story hits its menacing peak and Park unleashes a thrilling finale as our illustrious Northerners hurtle around the house on a model train. Brilliant. 9/10

    Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!

    Wallace and gromit have had some amazing great adventures with some of the best short films ever! This just reaches No.1 of there best even if a grand day out and a close shave are masterpieces of their own. The story is well done with the most funniest animated villain in years (my opinion) and really good claymation (the rain is top notch and were talking about clay) its just great! The humour is really improved from a grand day out not because the previous short was not funny but this got me choking at one point. Some of the best humour but what surprises me is the sadness with the scene with gromit running away I recommend this one the most, I would hate someone who hates it but It would be worse if you never seen it. It got the mood and drama perfect A MUST!!!!!

    Again brilliantly animated with all the little subtle touches that make Aardman films so great! Of course Peter Sallis does his usual excellent job of voicing Wallace. The plot is more complicated than the first film and it shows the ambition of the studio to progress. Some of the ideas are really crazy, but they work so well in this medium. For me, not quite as good as 'A Grand Day Out', but a very close second HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 27,036 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 25 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 19,727 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10

    This little gem has its 20th birthday this year and man has it aged fine. While Wallace serves mostly as a tool (in the truest sense of the word), it's all about the face-off between Gromit and a criminal mastermind. It starts off with Gromit receiving the most curious birthday gift: a pair of remote-controlled mechanical trousers to take him out for a walk, so Wallace can stay at home and do whatever he likes. (Whose birthday is it anyway???) Neither particularly interested in the trousers, nor in being kept on a leash, Gromit just enjoys the day out. Upon return home, he finds Wallace having rented a room to a penguin named Feathers McGraw. This one quickly expresses much more interest in the new trousers than the actual presentee. Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen.

This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason.

The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10

    This little gem has its 20th birthday this year and man has it aged fine. While Wallace serves mostly as a tool (in the truest sense of the word), it's all about the face-off between Gromit and a criminal mastermind. It starts off with Gromit receiving the most curious birthday gift: a pair of remote-controlled mechanical trousers to take him out for a walk, so Wallace can stay at home and do whatever he likes. (Whose birthday is it anyway???) Neither particularly interested in the trousers, nor in being kept on a leash, Gromit just enjoys the day out. Upon return home, he finds Wallace having rented a room to a penguin named Feathers McGraw. This one quickly expresses much more interest in the new trousers than the actual presentee. Right when this film approaches the end and you feel you've never seen crime portrayed better in animation (the chicken comb disguise idea is as simple as it's genius), Park includes a great train chase scene that ought to serve as a lesson to every animator on how to use the western genre in animation. The score is unspectacular, but works wonders from start to finish and it was particularly entertaining to see Gromit metaphorically as Wallace's aged wife during the knitting and rolling pin scenes. My favorite scene that made me break into laughter was the moment Wallace wakes up at the museum and keeps rambling about how he's a respectable citizen. Here it was particularly nice to see him screaming not for his canine pal and not for his feathered "friend", with whom he bonded increasingly early on on Gromit's expense. This film is the most frequently and one of the highest rated IMDb short films for good reason. As of now, it's my favorite W&G piece (mainly because of one of the finest villain performances in animation history) and everybody should see it.

    Wallace (Peter Sallis) is used by a shady, criminal penguin in a robbery involving mechanical trousers. Nick Park has said this was his favorite of the Wallace and Gromit films, and I have to agree with him. Whether I have seen all of them or not is not clear to me, but of those I have, this one definitely stands out as the masterwork -- how do you top a villain played by a shady, snaky penguin? The animation is incredible, especially when we see the way the outside of the buildings are crafted. The clay of the main characters may be relatively simplistic, but this is not because the animators lack talent.

    The Wrong Trousers is directed by Nick Park who also co-writes the story with Bob Baker. Out of Aardman Animations and featuring the voice of Peter Sallis, the story sees Wallace & Gromit up to their necks in trouble when they take in a mysterious penguin lodger. The second animated feature outing for Wallace & Gromit is that type of animated feature that the kids roar at and the adults nod appreciatively towards. With its low key sense of humour, crime movie homage and scorching attention to detail, it's as good as claymation gets. Structured in simple three tier movie format, Park enjoys dallying with noir like visuals as Julian Nott's music rumbles away like it was a Karloff movie. Then it's into the final quarter where the story hits its menacing peak and Park unleashes a thrilling finale as our illustrious Northerners hurtle around the house on a model train. Brilliant. 9/10

    Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!

    Wallace and gromit have had some amazing great adventures with some of the best short films ever! This just reaches No.1 of there best even if a grand day out and a close shave are masterpieces of their own. The story is well done with the most funniest animated villain in years (my opinion) and really good claymation (the rain is top notch and were talking about clay) its just great! The humour is really improved from a grand day out not because the previous short was not funny but this got me choking at one point. Some of the best humour but what surprises me is the sadness with the scene with gromit running away I recommend this one the most, I would hate someone who hates it but It would be worse if you never seen it. It got the mood and drama perfect A MUST!!!!!

    Again brilliantly animated with all the little subtle touches that make Aardman films so great! Of course Peter Sallis does his usual excellent job of voicing Wallace. The plot is more complicated than the first film and it shows the ambition of the studio to progress. Some of the ideas are really crazy, but they work so well in this medium. For me, not quite as good as 'A Grand Day Out', but a very close second HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 27,036 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 25 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 19,727 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes. If you haven't seen this yet you really should the next chance you get whatever your age... it is great for adults and children alike without relying on in-jokes that only adults will get.

    Wallace and Gromit exploded onto TV screens in 1989 with A Grand Day Out. Although a little rough around the edges, it was consistently charming, and left us breathless with anticipation for the next adventure. And four years later, Aardman delivered with The Wrong Trousers. The Wrong Trousers is by far Aardman's masterpiece, and the best adventure we've seen with Wallace & Gromit to date. Where the first film had some obvious kinks to work out, The Wrong Trousers is all that A Grand Day Out should have been. Nick Park has polished his craft immeasurably in the years since. Everything about The Wrong Trousers works. It gives us many things A Grand Day Out didn't have. It pays more attention to plot. The characterisation is deeper. The writing is tighter. Every scene adds something. The animation is flawless. Its the perfect Wallace & Gromit movie. Wallace and Gromit are a bit strapped for cash. And to make ends meet, Wallace has to take in a lodger. A penguin called Feathers McGraw. Feathers doesn't waste any time at all making himself at home, in Gromit's bedroom no less. Feeling neglected, Gromit decides to move on, but not before he discovers that Feathers is really an escaped jailbird. And he plans to use Wallace to pull off a diamond heist, with Wallace's latest invention, the Techno-Trousers. Nick Park has made a conscious effort not to repeat the mistakes of A Grand Day Out. Although charming, the film was let down by a slightly skinny storyline driving it all. But with The Wrong Trousers, Park depends on a more substantial plot to spur the film on. Park has ironed out all the deficiencies, and turns in a tightly scripted, slickly directed stop-motion feature. One of the things that strikes you about The Wrong Trousers is the far darker tone. A Grand Day Out was made with a light exuberance. But The Wrong Trousers, right from the very beginning, is a more sinister story, that takes the characters of Wallace & Gromit into some very dark areas. This is surely indicative of the opening title sequence where we see the Techno-Trousers in harsh silhouette, and Julian Nott's playful musical score rushes to an abrupt halt. The film begins innocently enough, with Nick Park showing Wallace & Gromit doing they're usual routine. This film sees the debut of Wallace's outlandish way of getting up in the morning. Full of chutes, mechanical arms, and ready-made long-johns. But as soon as Feathers McGraw comes into the picture, there's a palpable sense of tension. Right away we take an instant dislike to him. And its hard not to feel for Gromit as Feathers slowly ousts him from Wallace's home. The film begins to resemble nothing so much as a classic noir movie. When Gromit gets wise to Feathers, he trails him through dark alleyways to a museum, where Feathers is sizing the heist. I love the part when Gromit keeps him under surveillance, by cutting a pair of eye-holes through a box, not realising the box has a picture of a dog on it, and he cut the holes where the eyes should go. Who in the audience didn't jump when Feathers sees someone (from Gromit's POV) peering at him? If you ran A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers side by side, the differences are clearer. The former is light, escapist entertainment. The latter pushes the envelope far more than stop-motion had ever gone before. When watching the film prior to writing my review, it was inescapable how serious it was. Nick Park doesn't have as much time for the witty sideswipes of the first film. The Wrong Trousers is a film carried almost entirely by plot. Every time you think the film is about to do something funny Park subverts it. The sight of Wallace in the Techno-Trousers is funny by itself, but when it comes to the robbery, instead of playing it for slapstick, Park milks the scene for suspense. Feathers remote controls an unsuspecting Wallace, getting him to scale the museum, hang from the ceiling, and try and grab the diamond in a claw like one of those grabbing games. It could rival anything in the Oceans 11 series. Park pulls out all the stops in the last ten minutes. Just because its animated doesn't mean it will patronise the audience. When Gromit threatens Feathers with a rolling pin, who could have predicted that the bird would respond by producing a gun? And one that fires real bullets too? What kind of a film are we in here? The highlights of the Wallace & Gromit movies are almost certainly the frenetic action sequences and the climax is a thrilling chase around the living room on a model train set with the Techno-Trousers running wild and Gromit frantically trying to keep up with Feathers without running out of track all at the same time. The Wrong Trousers is a triumph, in every possible way. The 30 minutes are over before you know it. It holds up in all the right places, even in repeat viewings. And who didn't cheer when Feathers gets his comeuppance? The film won a well deserved Oscar, and although I love all of the subsequent movies, The Wrong Trousers is still unsurpassed, and remains Wallace & Gromit's, and Aardman's finest hour.

    I'm a big fan of Aardman Studio. Their shorts are easily the greatest stop-motion animations of all time. And my favorite characters of theirs are Wallace and Gromit! "The Wrong Trousers" is the 2nd Wallace and Gromit short, and also the best. The story is: Wallace creates a giant robotic pair of trousers which he gives to Gromit for his birthday. Later on a penguin comes in. The penguin seems nice and cute when Wallace is around, but he's actually a criminal, and is planning to steal a diamond with the help of Wallace's mechanical trousers. "The Wrong Trousers" is truly an animated masterpiece. The animation is vastly superior to that of this short's predecessor "A Grand Day Out". The evil penguin, Feathers McGraw is actually quite creepy, and yet he doesn't say a word. The story is actually much better and more clever than the first one, which also had a creative story, but this one is still much better. Also the humor displayed in this short is hilarious. If you've never seen "The Wrong Trousers" I highly suggest you to do so. It's truly a masterpiece in animation, and not only is it the best Aardman production, the best Wallace and Gromit short, or the best thing Nick Park ever directed, but it's also one of the best animated shorts, period. It would easily be in the top 5. It's clever, funny, exciting, and highly enjoyable. The voice acting by Peter Sallis as Wallace, is great. The animation is amazing, and there isn't a dull moment in the whole short. "The Wrong Trousers" is just amazing. I can't put it any other way. Amazing is the best word to describe this wonderful clay-animated short film. Rating: 10/10 "Amazing"

    Ever since I first saw A Grand Day Out, I wanted to see what other shorts that our lovable heroes Wallace and Gromit are in, and when I say this, I was really crying and screaming with laughter! Wallace and Gromit have always been among some of my favorite animated characters that their have ever been, because I just plain love them, they are funny, no wait, they are hysterical, very witty, they have got a lot of really cool contraptions, and overall, they are just very lovable to me! I remember that I was a really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit before I even saw A Grand Day Out, and then I saw A Grand Day Out, and then from that day on, I really have loved Wallace and Gromit, and now that I own their shorts and the movie on DVD, I can watch them and love them even more and more and more whenever I really want to! I honestly think that the world would be very different without Wallace and Gromit! To all fans of the very lovable and hysterical Wallace and Gromit, if you really do love Wallace and Gromit and care to see a short that is really hysterical and filled with laughs, then you should see this one, because you are really going to be in pain from laughter when you watch this! You are going to love it even more and more the more times you watch it! 10/10
