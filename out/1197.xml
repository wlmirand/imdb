 <storyline>
  Earl Pilcher Jr., runs an equipment rental outfit in Arkansas, lives with his wife and kids and parents, and rarely takes off his gimme cap.

Earl makes the trip, initially receiving a cold welcome from Ray and Ray's son, Virgil. His birth mother's sister, Aunt T., an aged and blind matriarch, takes Earl in tow and insists that the family open up to him.

    Watch this if...you are in the mood for a movie with a nice message that is superbly acted. It tackles many racial issues and is entertaining, but drags a bit toward the end. Acting/Casting: 8* - Great casting and Duvall and Jones are gold in the lead roles. The supporting cast does a good job as well and this is really the strong point of the film. Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - I felt that the scenes taking place in Arkansas felt much more real than those in Chicago. The flashback scenes were done very well and overall the directing was on par. My biggest complaint would be the last 20 minutes of the film that seemed to drag a bit. Plot/Characters: 7* - Very well written story and message by Billy Bob Thornton concerning racism and passing judgment on those we don't actually know or get to know. It is a somewhat far fetched plot, but the irony and underlying premise is good. Entertainment Value: 6* - I enjoyed the film and the acting really carries the movie. There isn't a ton going on in the film, but it manages to keep your attention. A good show, but it will likely be a few years before I sit down to view this again. My Score: 8+6+7+6 = 27/4 = 6.75 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com

    Many African-American families include persons of varied complexions, from the darkest hues to the lightest. These light-complexioned individuals are simply "white" as the world reckons appearances. This very fact makes blacks and whites kin within the last four or five generations. Aunt T gives perhaps the most profound statement in this film: "Nobody ever knows what it's like for somebody else. That's always the problem." The writer Guy Murchie wrote that if there is anyone we disdain, do not shake our family tree because our ancestors both near and far will surprisingly show up with every racial variant imaginable. For some "A Family Thing" speaks an unpalatable truth: blacks and whites are kin and closely related to each other.

    It's pretty telling that people are still contributing reviews of this film 14 years after its release. It's hard to imagine anyone seeing it (or re-seeing it, as in my case) and not having a powerful emotional response. It's just that good. The acting is spectacular - not just the two leads, who are both as good as you'd expect them to be, but also the supporting cast. Irma Hall, as Aunt T is joy to behold. She'll still be in your thoughts days later. There's really not a throwaway scene here. Everything rings true and serves the plot. The settings are real-looking, the dialog is natural...it's just a fine piece of movie making. Kudos to Billy Bob Thornton and those involved in getting this from the drawing board to the screen. I'm guessing that kids won't like this as much as adults. Nothing blows up real good and there may be too much "wisdom" in the story. That's unfortunate because the moral center of this film is just where you'd want it to be, unless you're a die-hard retro racist. But forget morality. A FAMILY THING is just a hell of a fine piece of movie-making. As they used to say, "You'll laugh. You'll cry." They're both true. And you'll have a fine time in the process.

    The plot for "A Family Thing" sounds unlikely when you first hear about it. An Arkansas man gets a note from his deceased Mother that she is not his real Mother, that he is actually the product of a sexual encounter between his Father and the family's black maid. The letter urges him to travel to Chicago to find his half-brother, who is a black man. Sounds like a scenario Hollywood would dream up for a broad comedy ("I'm white, you're black, but we're brothers?" Cue wacky music) or a liberal social piece on how we all should "just get along". "A Family Thing" takes neither road. Instead it examines the realistic reactions the characters would have in such a situation. It services the racial element without getting preachy, and it finds comedy in unlikely places, but mostly it deals with the topic in a frank, straightforward manner. Robert Duval plays the bewildered Earl Pilcher, a hard-working equipment rental store owner and self- described "redneck", who suddenly finds the very foundation of his life shaken by his Mother's startling post-mortum revelation. His Father's silence on the matter confirms the story, so Earl hops in his truck and drives to Chicago. He locates his half-brother, Ray, a good-natured Chicago cop nearing retirement, played by James Earl Jones. Ray is polite but cynical about the whole matter, with some deep rooted hatred for Earl's Father that he manages to keep from spilling over to much on to Earl. They part ways, but Earl is car-jacked and ends up in a hospital with a concussion, and the only thing they find on him is Ray's phone number. Thus the stage is set for an unorthodox family reunion. Duval and Jones hit all the right notes as the perplexed brothers discovering each other, despite their distaste for their shared history. Duval's flawed but decent Earl is reminiscent of his performance in "Tender Mercies", subtle and understated. Jone's Ray is a kind-hearted man who has nursed the wounds from a hard life and come out better for the experiences. In a touching scene, beautifully under-played by both actors, the two men talk about their experiences in the Korean War while preparing to bed down for the night. They are two unlikely brothers sharing a room, and sharing their lives. Michael Beach plays Ray's angry son, Virgil, a divorced bus driver who lost his chance at athletic stardom to a knee injury. But the most fascinating performance is delivered by Irma P Hall as Ray's (and Earl's) Aunt T. Aunt T is a cranky but soulful old woman who happens to be blind, but she sees things the other characters can't, and teaches them all a thing or two about the meaning of family. A scene where she recounts the night of Earl's birth is the emotional highlight of the film. Don't expect any fireworks or explosions. "A Family Thing" is mostly a quiet, character-driven story. Do expect to be touched by the simple drama of human lives, relayed by a talented director (Richard Pierce) two insightful writers (Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson) and some very skilled actors.

    I would like to give this movie a higher rating, but there is something that detracts from it's quality. Duvall is a brilliant actor, but perhaps the whitest guy in Hollywood. His complex is pale, and he doesn't have any curls to his hair. Now, it is hard to believe that Nicole Ritchie is half-black, but you can see she has a darker complexion. Therefore, it is impossible to believe that Duvall's character is half-black. If Duvall's character grew up in this very white small town, people probably would have suspected he had American Indian, Italian, or Hispanic blood. Duvall's character may have been aware that he was not totally Scotch-Irish. If he were in the Bayou, perhaps it wouldn't be as big a deal. But in farm country of the South, highly unlikely that he wouldn't be aware of something. I didn't like the fact that Duvall's character goes to the big city and all of a sudden he is being considered half-black. It would be more of an adjustment than the movie portrays. In addition, his nephew probably would have resented him giving advice to him. Why wouldn't James Earl Jones' character be the one to give him advice. The movie was interesting, but this point severally detracts from it's credibility. I have a better idea. Why not make Duvall's character 100% white, and have the Father having an extramarital affair that produced Jones' character. Jones' is definitely light to medium brown complexion. He could be a believable mulatto. The Father could be the one dying. On his deathbed he can confess that he had an extramarital affair, and that there was a half-brother to Duvall's character. The Father could leave out the fact that his brother is half-black. Then Duvall's character shows up, and is completely shocked. This would have been a better idea. Duvall could have been conflicted, because he was so white, but now he had to accept that his brother was half-black. In addition, Jones' family would deal with their own fears and reluctance in accepting Duvall's character. This would have been a more meaningful scenario. It would have forced both races to accept that they have a father in common.

    I like Robert Duvall. He has made some great films over the years - A Civil Action, The Apostle, Tender Mercies, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now and the Godfather, to name a few. Even his small films are great, like Assassination Tango. This film, co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, is a gem that shines in a sea of excellence. The discovery that his real mother was black, was a shock to Earl Pilcher Jr. (Duvall), and he heads off from Arkansas to Chicago to find his brother Ray, played by James Earl Jones, another great actor known by most people as Darth Vader. Ray already knows everything and is not anxious to revive old memories. The interaction between the two is mesmerizing and funny. It is what movies are all about. Irma P. Hall (The Ladykillers, A Lesson Before Dying) is captivating as Aunt T. and has some of the best lines in the film. It is worth your time just to see her. What a memorable experience!

    Robert Duvall plays an aging Southerner who discovers he has a half-brother -- and worse, their mother was black! He journeys to Chicago to meet his half-brother (James Earl Jones), who is as shaken as he to discover their connection. The blind Aunt T. (Irma Hall), who lives with Jones, helps the two men sort out their differences. A familiar TV face, Michael Beach, plays Jones' grown son, who is dealing with personal problems and not exactly overjoyed to have a white man -- worse, a bona fide cracker -- in the family. Duvall walks away with this one. He is amazing. At one point, after having been carjacked and beaten and wandering off from Jones in anger and hurt feelings, he finds himself in a bar where he drunkenly invites himself to join a table of folks celebrating one of the ladies' birthdays. They're black, and his redneck, incorrect way of talking to them becomes painful to hear. He is that convincing. The last shot of the movie, which is absolutely precious, has Aunt T. walking away from the camera, headed for the market. Veteran movie and TV director Richard Pearce made this from a script cowritten by Billy Bob Thornton. A must-see.

    This movie is one of my all time favorites. It felt so real. My family has a story like this. The acting by all the cast members were awesome. It feels so real when you are watching the flick. I would love to see it come to Broadway as a show something like that or as a play or whatever. Aunt Tiara, Aunt T was great!!!!!Love her. "Now don't go forgetting about your old Aunt T"!!!!!!!!!She rocks.......James Earl Jones, who by the way is one of the best actors ever; was interviewed on the Diane Rimms radio show ca. 2006 and he said it was one of his favorites also! ....... Now then ..........the birthing scene WOW it was one of my best parts-- so real powerful and sad. I cried like a baby. Loved the soundtrack also, great music these songs where just perfect! Robert Duval was perfect, love him also....JKE Brooklyn, NY 2/1/2007

    I feel some of the best movies are those that depict human drama... Movies that 'could really happen' and this is one of them. "A Family Thing" is a story about an aging southern white man who learns at his mother's deathbed that not only was he adopted, but that his birth mother was black. This Robert Duvall / James Earl Jones pairing is superb! Aunt T (Irma P Hall) ties the movie together with her love for a dead sister's child deep enough to bridge any racial barrier. Her character uses homespun wisdom to enlighten 'the boys' with heartwarming honesty. Scenes include arguments/wrestling matches just like two natural siblings would participate in.. and of course there are moments when Aunt T's wisdom coaxes two half brothers into being whole ones... All in all A Good Watch....

    What a pleasant surprise this was. I caught this one day on Showtime and really didn't give it much of a chance. But I was so wrong!! Powerful performance by Irma P. Hall (as Aunt T.), and Robert Duvall is at his best as well. Wonderfully acted and written, this has to be the best movie I have seen in a long while. Sure, the same old southern stereotypes are portrayed as well as the same for the inner-city black culture, with many being quite accurate. Some parts were a little over the top, like the birthday party in the bar that Earl crashes as a total stranger. But that being said, not a lot of negatives I can say about this movie.

    I feel some of the best movies are those that depict human drama... Movies that 'could really happen' and this is one of them. "A Family Thing" is a story about an aging southern white man who learns at his mother's deathbed that not only was he adopted, but that his birth mother was black. This Robert Duvall / James Earl Jones pairing is superb! Aunt T (Irma P Hall) ties the movie together with her love for a dead sister's child deep enough to bridge any racial barrier. Her character uses homespun wisdom to enlighten 'the boys' with heartwarming honesty. Scenes include arguments/wrestling matches just like two natural siblings would participate in.. and of course there are moments when Aunt T's wisdom coaxes two half brothers into being whole ones... All in all A Good Watch....

    What a pleasant surprise this was. I caught this one day on Showtime and really didn't give it much of a chance. But I was so wrong!! Powerful performance by Irma P. Hall (as Aunt T.), and Robert Duvall is at his best as well. Wonderfully acted and written, this has to be the best movie I have seen in a long while. Sure, the same old southern stereotypes are portrayed as well as the same for the inner-city black culture, with many being quite accurate. Some parts were a little over the top, like the birthday party in the bar that Earl crashes as a total stranger. But that being said, not a lot of negatives I can say about this movie.

    Watch this if...you are in the mood for a movie with a nice message that is superbly acted. It tackles many racial issues and is entertaining, but drags a bit toward the end. Acting/Casting: 8* - Great casting and Duvall and Jones are gold in the lead roles. The supporting cast does a good job as well and this is really the strong point of the film. Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - I felt that the scenes taking place in Arkansas felt much more real than those in Chicago. The flashback scenes were done very well and overall the directing was on par. My biggest complaint would be the last 20 minutes of the film that seemed to drag a bit. Plot/Characters: 7* - Very well written story and message by Billy Bob Thornton concerning racism and passing judgment on those we don't actually know or get to know. It is a somewhat far fetched plot, but the irony and underlying premise is good. Entertainment Value: 6* - I enjoyed the film and the acting really carries the movie. There isn't a ton going on in the film, but it manages to keep your attention. A good show, but it will likely be a few years before I sit down to view this again. My Score: 8+6+7+6 = 27/4 = 6.75 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com

    Many African-American families include persons of varied complexions, from the darkest hues to the lightest. These light-complexioned individuals are simply "white" as the world reckons appearances. This very fact makes blacks and whites kin within the last four or five generations. Aunt T gives perhaps the most profound statement in this film: "Nobody ever knows what it's like for somebody else. That's always the problem." The writer Guy Murchie wrote that if there is anyone we disdain, do not shake our family tree because our ancestors both near and far will surprisingly show up with every racial variant imaginable. For some "A Family Thing" speaks an unpalatable truth: blacks and whites are kin and closely related to each other.

    It's pretty telling that people are still contributing reviews of this film 14 years after its release. It's hard to imagine anyone seeing it (or re-seeing it, as in my case) and not having a powerful emotional response. It's just that good. The acting is spectacular - not just the two leads, who are both as good as you'd expect them to be, but also the supporting cast. Irma Hall, as Aunt T is joy to behold. She'll still be in your thoughts days later. There's really not a throwaway scene here. Everything rings true and serves the plot. The settings are real-looking, the dialog is natural...it's just a fine piece of movie making. Kudos to Billy Bob Thornton and those involved in getting this from the drawing board to the screen. I'm guessing that kids won't like this as much as adults. Nothing blows up real good and there may be too much "wisdom" in the story. That's unfortunate because the moral center of this film is just where you'd want it to be, unless you're a die-hard retro racist. But forget morality. A FAMILY THING is just a hell of a fine piece of movie-making. As they used to say, "You'll laugh. You'll cry." They're both true. And you'll have a fine time in the process.

    The plot for "A Family Thing" sounds unlikely when you first hear about it. An Arkansas man gets a note from his deceased Mother that she is not his real Mother, that he is actually the product of a sexual encounter between his Father and the family's black maid. The letter urges him to travel to Chicago to find his half-brother, who is a black man. Sounds like a scenario Hollywood would dream up for a broad comedy ("I'm white, you're black, but we're brothers?" Cue wacky music) or a liberal social piece on how we all should "just get along". "A Family Thing" takes neither road. Instead it examines the realistic reactions the characters would have in such a situation. It services the racial element without getting preachy, and it finds comedy in unlikely places, but mostly it deals with the topic in a frank, straightforward manner. Robert Duval plays the bewildered Earl Pilcher, a hard-working equipment rental store owner and self- described "redneck", who suddenly finds the very foundation of his life shaken by his Mother's startling post-mortum revelation. His Father's silence on the matter confirms the story, so Earl hops in his truck and drives to Chicago. He locates his half-brother, Ray, a good-natured Chicago cop nearing retirement, played by James Earl Jones. Ray is polite but cynical about the whole matter, with some deep rooted hatred for Earl's Father that he manages to keep from spilling over to much on to Earl. They part ways, but Earl is car-jacked and ends up in a hospital with a concussion, and the only thing they find on him is Ray's phone number. Thus the stage is set for an unorthodox family reunion. Duval and Jones hit all the right notes as the perplexed brothers discovering each other, despite their distaste for their shared history. Duval's flawed but decent Earl is reminiscent of his performance in "Tender Mercies", subtle and understated. Jone's Ray is a kind-hearted man who has nursed the wounds from a hard life and come out better for the experiences. In a touching scene, beautifully under-played by both actors, the two men talk about their experiences in the Korean War while preparing to bed down for the night. They are two unlikely brothers sharing a room, and sharing their lives. Michael Beach plays Ray's angry son, Virgil, a divorced bus driver who lost his chance at athletic stardom to a knee injury. But the most fascinating performance is delivered by Irma P Hall as Ray's (and Earl's) Aunt T. Aunt T is a cranky but soulful old woman who happens to be blind, but she sees things the other characters can't, and teaches them all a thing or two about the meaning of family. A scene where she recounts the night of Earl's birth is the emotional highlight of the film. Don't expect any fireworks or explosions. "A Family Thing" is mostly a quiet, character-driven story. Do expect to be touched by the simple drama of human lives, relayed by a talented director (Richard Pierce) two insightful writers (Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson) and some very skilled actors.

    I would like to give this movie a higher rating, but there is something that detracts from it's quality. Duvall is a brilliant actor, but perhaps the whitest guy in Hollywood. His complex is pale, and he doesn't have any curls to his hair. Now, it is hard to believe that Nicole Ritchie is half-black, but you can see she has a darker complexion. Therefore, it is impossible to believe that Duvall's character is half-black. If Duvall's character grew up in this very white small town, people probably would have suspected he had American Indian, Italian, or Hispanic blood. Duvall's character may have been aware that he was not totally Scotch-Irish. If he were in the Bayou, perhaps it wouldn't be as big a deal. But in farm country of the South, highly unlikely that he wouldn't be aware of something. I didn't like the fact that Duvall's character goes to the big city and all of a sudden he is being considered half-black. It would be more of an adjustment than the movie portrays. In addition, his nephew probably would have resented him giving advice to him. Why wouldn't James Earl Jones' character be the one to give him advice. The movie was interesting, but this point severally detracts from it's credibility. I have a better idea. Why not make Duvall's character 100% white, and have the Father having an extramarital affair that produced Jones' character. Jones' is definitely light to medium brown complexion. He could be a believable mulatto. The Father could be the one dying. On his deathbed he can confess that he had an extramarital affair, and that there was a half-brother to Duvall's character. The Father could leave out the fact that his brother is half-black. Then Duvall's character shows up, and is completely shocked. This would have been a better idea. Duvall could have been conflicted, because he was so white, but now he had to accept that his brother was half-black. In addition, Jones' family would deal with their own fears and reluctance in accepting Duvall's character. This would have been a more meaningful scenario. It would have forced both races to accept that they have a father in common.

    I like Robert Duvall. He has made some great films over the years - A Civil Action, The Apostle, Tender Mercies, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now and the Godfather, to name a few. Even his small films are great, like Assassination Tango. This film, co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, is a gem that shines in a sea of excellence. The discovery that his real mother was black, was a shock to Earl Pilcher Jr. (Duvall), and he heads off from Arkansas to Chicago to find his brother Ray, played by James Earl Jones, another great actor known by most people as Darth Vader. Ray already knows everything and is not anxious to revive old memories. The interaction between the two is mesmerizing and funny. It is what movies are all about. Irma P. Hall (The Ladykillers, A Lesson Before Dying) is captivating as Aunt T. and has some of the best lines in the film. It is worth your time just to see her. What a memorable experience!

    Robert Duvall plays an aging Southerner who discovers he has a half-brother -- and worse, their mother was black! He journeys to Chicago to meet his half-brother (James Earl Jones), who is as shaken as he to discover their connection. The blind Aunt T. (Irma Hall), who lives with Jones, helps the two men sort out their differences. A familiar TV face, Michael Beach, plays Jones' grown son, who is dealing with personal problems and not exactly overjoyed to have a white man -- worse, a bona fide cracker -- in the family. Duvall walks away with this one. He is amazing. At one point, after having been carjacked and beaten and wandering off from Jones in anger and hurt feelings, he finds himself in a bar where he drunkenly invites himself to join a table of folks celebrating one of the ladies' birthdays. They're black, and his redneck, incorrect way of talking to them becomes painful to hear. He is that convincing. The last shot of the movie, which is absolutely precious, has Aunt T. walking away from the camera, headed for the market. Veteran movie and TV director Richard Pearce made this from a script cowritten by Billy Bob Thornton. A must-see.
