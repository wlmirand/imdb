 <sinopse>
  The story of two men, who met as apprentices in the Peking Opera, and stayed friends for over 50 years.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "Farewell, My Concubine" is a movie with two parallel, intertwined stories. It is the story of two performers in the Beijing Opera, stage brothers, and the woman who comes between them. At the same time, it attempts to do no less than squeeze the entire political history of China in the twentieth century into a three-hour time-frame.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

    In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love.

He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

    In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love.

He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

    In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty.

He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

    In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    Farewell My Concubine is a Chinese film that stars Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Feng-Yi together with Lu Qi, Ying Da, Ge You and David Wu. It is similar to other Fifth Generation films like To Live and The Blue Kite, the movie explores the effect of China's political turmoil during the mid-20th century on the lives of individuals, families, and groups, in this case, two stars in a Peking opera troupe and the woman who comes between them.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Lilian Lee. Lilian Lee is also one of the film's screenplay writers.It was directed by Chen Kaige. Not many people were aware that most members of the Peking Opera were originally orphans or illegitimate castaways with nowhere else to turn. Such is the case of Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi, two homeless outcasts, trained from childhood in the grueling rigors of the Opera by master Lu Qui in the film.It traces the 52-year friendship between Xiaolou and Dieyi, a friendship pockmarked with fiery conflicts and tender reconciliations. Though the delicate Dieyi specializes in female roles and the gutsy Xiaolou plays noble warriors, theirs is an essentially heterosexual relationship; still, when Xiaolou takes upon himself a prostitute bride, Dieyi is as petty and jealous as an outcast mistress. Farewell, My Concubine holds the viewer in thrall from start to finish; as such, it is thoroughly deserving of its many international film awards and nominations.No question that this is a classic film on its own as it has all the elements of a great film.The performances were brilliant and outstanding especially that of Gong Li.It was visually stunning as well.The screenplay was intelligent and outstanding while the characters are emotionally involving as the viewer will care and sympathize with them.And most of all,the direction of Chen Kaige is superb and marvelous.I give this film a very high recommendation as a must-see movie.

    Farewell My Concubine is a glorious epic about two friends over the span of many decades. Together they go through the horrors of opera school as children in the 1920's, and then Opera stars during the Japanese invasion of China in the 30's, the Communist takeover in the 40's, and the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together. This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another. The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her. This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.

    Chen Kaige's "B&agrave;w&aacute;ng Bi&eacute; Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine" in English) is a breathtaking look at the changes in 20th century China as seen through the eyes of two friends. Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things. This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.

    It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved  the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game  Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays "The Concubine", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays "The Gangster King" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop. Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter. Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film. Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character. Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.

    There is no doubt that this is a great movie. You could check out the awards it won. I just want to mention that the main hero of this movie is Leslie Cheung who is my favorite singer.One of his great song is When Love Fades Away（in Chinese Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wang Shi)that is the theme song of this movie. If you are interested in this song, you might as well give it a try. Well, it's a mandarin song, but as the saying goes" Music knows no boundary between countries".You might be impressed by the emotion it expresses. Besides, the following songs sung by Leslie are also great if you I want to know more.Silence is golden(Chen Mo Shi Jin)、In My Life Time(Jin Sheng Jin Shi)、Blamefully Beautiful（Guai Ni Guo Fen Mei Li)、The One Who Doesn't Want To Hold Me（Bu Xiang Yong Bao Wo De Ren)

    After finishing watching "The Last Emperor", I found quite entertaining the way they portrayed events of modern Chinese history throughout the story of somebody's life. Since I know that movie might be a Hollywood-esque portray of those events, I looked for a movie with Chinese actors, that also developed through key events of modern Chinese history (e.g. the warlords, revolution, etc). Netflix suggested me "Farewell my concubine". This movie was definitely not my cup of tea: I found the first hour brutally violent, and hard to watch (the first 45-60 minutes). It might have been because in my opinion, the violence portray seemed to not help the development of the story. The movie felt too long, and probably since I did not like the first hour of the movie due to the fact stated above, the last hour and a half felt a bit boring (something I did not feel in "The last emperor" which was also a loooong movie). Finally. This is my own bias, since I do not like opera, the opera scenes seemed highly repetitive and the high pitch voice was hard to bear.

    In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera "Farewell My Concubine" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.' With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text. Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.

    I'm beginning to wonder if you can't measure a society's participation in the global economy of what used to be called "the free world" by the quality of its movies. China is still a monolithic and authoritarian structure but it's loosening up. It was only ten or so years ago that a friend who had visited mentioned that there were only ten McDonald's in all of Beijing. Now the city is more sophisticated than the one I live in, which is served by a weekly train of burros from the nearest cavalry fort. "Starbucks" is the name of the Mimbreno Apache who brings me an occasional jack rabbit carcass. But, all seriousness aside, this is a pretty good, and quite subtle and adult, film. It's a longie, so I was unable to catch the last half hour or so, but what I did see should be applauded for its acting, direction, and production design. It squeezes a long period of time, from 1932 to beyond Mao's take over, into the story of two orphan boys at a school that trains performers for Chinese opera. The female parts are played by men and boys, as in Shakespeare's time, and in fact Cheung, who plays the female part, looks pretty appealing in make up. Cheung's friend, Zhang, is masculine and plays the role of the King of Chu in gaudy make up. Chinese opera is a demanding art. As children, the two friends are beaten without mercy -- and I mean BEATEN -- for any mistakes they make. One of them is beaten even when his recitation is perfect, "to remind you how good you were." The two grow up to become famous actors in the opera -- Zhang as the demanding and desolate king, and Cheung as his devoted concubine who kills herself. But then -- cherchez la femme. And who is the femme? The luscious and beautiful Gong Li (or Li Gong, to put her clan name first.) She's a knockout. It's no wonder that she's able to finagle Zhang into rescuing her from the whorehouse -- The House of Blossoms -- and marrying her. But, as new wives will, she's jealous of Zhang's close friendship with Cheung, who by this time has become gay. Disruptions ensue. Politics rears its ugly head. And at that point -- three in the morning -- I had to shut it off and go to bed. I don't know what happens at the end. I hope Cheung gets his head straight and becomes heterosexual again, that Zhang is satisfied with the arrangement, and that Gong Li becomes an eager participant in a polyandrous marriage. Things would be so much easier all around.

    Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness. First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money. His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream. Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love.

He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.
