    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie.

When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.

    Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest modern directors, with Taxi Driver, The Departed and Raging Bull under is belt, he is for sure going to be remembered as one of the best directors ever. Yesterday i saw one of his movies that I've been recommended to see from... well just about everyone I know (my gym teacher even recommended it to me), the movie is Goodfellas. Goodfellas is considered by most to be his best work. The movie follows the real life of Henry Hill as a gangster from his childhood in the 50s to adulthood in the 80s. The movie is great, no doubt about it. The performances in it all all very good, Robert De Niro does a good job as Henry's friend Jimmy. But my favorite character in the movie has to be Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, his performance is excellence he can turn on a dime perfectly and he's a real funny guy. The main three characters (Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry) are all extremely likable despite the fact that they're criminals who steal, and kill. I enjoyed when the movie went through a new decade you could clearly see the change in surroundings, attitudes and other things. Also when the decade changed so did the music, in the 50s the music was form the 50s, in the 60s it was from the 60s and so on. The movies writing is really where it stands out. It's a very tightly connected script that doesn't feel rushed even thou it has to cover over 30 years of events. The movie also had something that I like in any movie and that is long takes. There were 5 to 8 minute sequences all one take and filled with easily 50 extras that all had to do there job and the actors themselves needed to remember when to greet and be greeted, this was something that I can guarantee took multiple tries to get right. Over the course of the movie you see how Henry and the business changes from simple stealing and intimidating to drugs and murder. So the movie is one of the pivotal gangster/mob movies along with The Godfather and Scarface. My rating 8.8 out of 10.

    No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie. Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance. Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: "cautious yet violent gangster" Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead. All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface.

    This is my first review. Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times. Let me start off by saying this is a good movie. But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind. But even in the next tier of "gangster" films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones. It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great. But it lacks depth. My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the "gangster lifestyle" simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin. You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all. This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there. For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme. Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think. On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one. Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

    The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the "family" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to "never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut". The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into "the family business". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for "sharing" their wealth and protecting the innocent. The film goes on to introduce the other members of the "family". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the "family" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his "victims" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with "the deal". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.

    Martin Scorsese has an uncanny ability, to use his impeccable taste in music, to choose the perfect song, to enhance a near perfect scene. By adding this music in the background, as a soundtrack for the scene, the scene becomes perfect thanks to Marty. A great example of this in Goodfellas, is a scene with Ray Liotta, in an around his house in Long Island. The song is "Jump Into The Fire" by Harry Nilisson. The detuned bass and syncopating drum beats, coupled with an alternating pitch between the two speaker channels, sounds totally chaotic. This cacophony totally mirrors Ray Liotta's cocaine fueled, paranoid head space. For me, 40-50%of my fondness for the film Goodfellas, lies directly in the soundtrack and score of the movie. I gave the film a 9 out of 10, but I believe the soundtrack itself rates a perfect 10.

    Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.

    I watched this film on advice from a friend, im very glad i did it is a great film, it is violent but i think it shows a dim view of gangster life, for me it is the definitive gangster movie Robert De Niro is as always great in his role, he plays Jimmy Conway (Jimmy The Gent) an experienced, gentleman like but deadly gangster Ray Liotta while not a great performance is convincing as Henry Hill, in my opinion anyone coulf have played the role Joe Pesci is probably on par with De Niro, he is brilliant as tough, vivious psychopath Tommy, he won the 1990 best supporting actor acadamy award and its well deserved Don't miss this film

    Like the title says, this movie is absolutely enormous. One of the most entertaining, realistic, captivating movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. It never seems to get old either. Not a big fan of the way it spirals downward in the last quarter or so, but I suppose they wanted to stay true to the story, and I suppose it adds to the realism as well. A great film nonetheless. Scorsese at his best, and I don't feel Ray Liotta got his due. I suppose he was overshadowed by Pesci is all. On a side note, I still don't understand one scene of the movie. When Karen goes to see Jimmy in that rundown neighbourhood and he gives her some cash and tells her to go look at some dresses (I think) down the street. It always seemed peculiar to me. The first few times I saw it, it seemed like he was setting her up to be whacked...but that doesn't seem right. Anybody know?

    Review #3 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen. The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as "The Godfather", if not better. The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is. Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch. Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than "The Godfather". HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous "funny guy" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel. The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film! Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10.
