    Lloyd and Harry are two very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver the case to her personally. However, Mary isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case..... Almost twenty years ago, this was comedy gold. Carrey was the biggest thing on the planet (The Mask and Ace Ventura were huge hits), and this was a really different type of comedy, never really seen before, so it was a huge success. Watching it now, knowing that The Farellys haven't done anything of note since 2000, and Carrey since 2003, the film is still good, but you really tend to focus more on Daniels, because he really plays against type in this, and he steals the film from Carrey. Its a simple premise, but the high concept of the two being 'dumb' is just great, and makes a simple premise all the more interesting. Supporting characters are just as funny, and some key scenes play out as sketches, which are funny standalone. So all in all, its a great comedy, and moved the genre a notch or two up, and paved the way of comedy for the next few years...

    I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny. This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the "Pull over" joke ("That's a cardigan!"), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, "I beg your pardon?" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the "pull over" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good. Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.

    IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spolier- State Trooper: Harry is driving fast and a cop is behind him and Lloyd, he says "Pull over"! Harry: What? State Trooper: Pull over!!! Harry: realizes he's holding beer bottles that Lloyd urinated in; shows his sweater No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing ! Lloyd: Yeah, killer boots, man! What IS AWESOMER THAN THAT !?!?!?! Harry: So you got fired again, eh? Lloyd: Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know? Harry: Yeah, well, I lost my job too. Lloyd: Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Harry: No, none taken. You know what really chaps my a** though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred. Lloyd: Hey, chicks love it. It's a shagging' wagon.

    This was the first movie i ever watched and i am glad that my parents let me!Now obviously at the age of three i didn't understand most of the humor such as, Harry putting the snowman's face to resemble its genitals, or Mary's breasts resembling car headlights (I just thought she was robotic!).But still without understanding those hilarious scenes, i still watched this movie almost four times a week!I enjoyed laughing at Harry making a noisy bowel movement, and Lloyd and Harry's sing-a-long in the car!If you love films making fun of dimwits but also embracing them, you will love this film! Even the banter between Harry and Lloyd is enough for me to give this film a SOLID 9! So do yourself a favor and watch this film.

    This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. I'm a guy who is, well,essentially a snob when it comes to films, preferring foreign, dark dramas or Woody Allen flicks (my exception is Zombies...go figure!) BUT how I missed this until now is beyond me. Just caught it last night - performances are brilliant/funny... Physical/verbal comedy...plot twists...genuinely hysterical. Even thought it's 20 plus years old, it holds up well. I read that there is a sequel in the works, and whether or not that's a good idea is hard to say. I will say based on THIS film I'll shell out my 12 bucks to see a sequel with a room full of fans. By the way, this is NOT for kids - even thought the characters are cartoons essentially - the humor would surely be missed on most them.

    As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his "wheelhouse" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here. Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect "ride". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a "straight-man" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs. This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the "cool" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of "cool" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy "buddy movies"! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result. Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the "crown" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.

    Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all. All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.

    Don't let the title of the movie fool you, Dumb & Dumber explains exactly who the two main characters of the movie are; Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) & Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels). They are so out of sorts from the norm that all the basics of everyday life they encounter in this movie turns into a triumph of one-liners that can be used in your everyday life. Watching this movie takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride across the country following Lloyd & Harry. Not only are you following this two dumb characters along the way, but you are following a story that keeps you intrigued until the ending credits. Without letting too much out, I encourage everyone to watch this movie that has endless laugh out loud moments and quirky lines that will keep you talking about this film for years to come.

    Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as "Yes Man" and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in "Ace Ventura Pet Detective." While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

    Lloyd and Harry are two very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver the case to her personally. However, Mary isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case..... Almost twenty years ago, this was comedy gold. Carrey was the biggest thing on the planet (The Mask and Ace Ventura were huge hits), and this was a really different type of comedy, never really seen before, so it was a huge success. Watching it now, knowing that The Farellys haven't done anything of note since 2000, and Carrey since 2003, the film is still good, but you really tend to focus more on Daniels, because he really plays against type in this, and he steals the film from Carrey. Its a simple premise, but the high concept of the two being 'dumb' is just great, and makes a simple premise all the more interesting. Supporting characters are just as funny, and some key scenes play out as sketches, which are funny standalone. So all in all, its a great comedy, and moved the genre a notch or two up, and paved the way of comedy for the next few years...

    I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny. This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the "Pull over" joke ("That's a cardigan!"), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, "I beg your pardon?" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the "pull over" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good. Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.

    IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spolier- State Trooper: Harry is driving fast and a cop is behind him and Lloyd, he says "Pull over"! Harry: What? State Trooper: Pull over!!! Harry: realizes he's holding beer bottles that Lloyd urinated in; shows his sweater No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing ! Lloyd: Yeah, killer boots, man! What IS AWESOMER THAN THAT !?!?!?! Harry: So you got fired again, eh? Lloyd: Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know? Harry: Yeah, well, I lost my job too. Lloyd: Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Harry: No, none taken. You know what really chaps my a** though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred. Lloyd: Hey, chicks love it. It's a shagging' wagon.

    This was the first movie i ever watched and i am glad that my parents let me!Now obviously at the age of three i didn't understand most of the humor such as, Harry putting the snowman's face to resemble its genitals, or Mary's breasts resembling car headlights (I just thought she was robotic!).But still without understanding those hilarious scenes, i still watched this movie almost four times a week!I enjoyed laughing at Harry making a noisy bowel movement, and Lloyd and Harry's sing-a-long in the car!If you love films making fun of dimwits but also embracing them, you will love this film! Even the banter between Harry and Lloyd is enough for me to give this film a SOLID 9! So do yourself a favor and watch this film.

    This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. I'm a guy who is, well,essentially a snob when it comes to films, preferring foreign, dark dramas or Woody Allen flicks (my exception is Zombies...go figure!) BUT how I missed this until now is beyond me. Just caught it last night - performances are brilliant/funny... Physical/verbal comedy...plot twists...genuinely hysterical. Even thought it's 20 plus years old, it holds up well. I read that there is a sequel in the works, and whether or not that's a good idea is hard to say. I will say based on THIS film I'll shell out my 12 bucks to see a sequel with a room full of fans. By the way, this is NOT for kids - even thought the characters are cartoons essentially - the humor would surely be missed on most them.

    As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his "wheelhouse" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here. Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect "ride". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a "straight-man" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs. This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the "cool" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of "cool" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy "buddy movies"! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result. Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the "crown" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.

    Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all. All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.

    Don't let the title of the movie fool you, Dumb & Dumber explains exactly who the two main characters of the movie are; Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) & Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels). They are so out of sorts from the norm that all the basics of everyday life they encounter in this movie turns into a triumph of one-liners that can be used in your everyday life. Watching this movie takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride across the country following Lloyd & Harry. Not only are you following this two dumb characters along the way, but you are following a story that keeps you intrigued until the ending credits. Without letting too much out, I encourage everyone to watch this movie that has endless laugh out loud moments and quirky lines that will keep you talking about this film for years to come.

    Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as "Yes Man" and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in "Ace Ventura Pet Detective." While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

    Lloyd and Harry are two very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver the case to her personally. However, Mary isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case..... Almost twenty years ago, this was comedy gold. Carrey was the biggest thing on the planet (The Mask and Ace Ventura were huge hits), and this was a really different type of comedy, never really seen before, so it was a huge success. Watching it now, knowing that The Farellys haven't done anything of note since 2000, and Carrey since 2003, the film is still good, but you really tend to focus more on Daniels, because he really plays against type in this, and he steals the film from Carrey. Its a simple premise, but the high concept of the two being 'dumb' is just great, and makes a simple premise all the more interesting. Supporting characters are just as funny, and some key scenes play out as sketches, which are funny standalone. So all in all, its a great comedy, and moved the genre a notch or two up, and paved the way of comedy for the next few years...

    I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny. This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the "Pull over" joke ("That's a cardigan!"), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, "I beg your pardon?" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the "pull over" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good. Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.

    IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spolier- State Trooper: Harry is driving fast and a cop is behind him and Lloyd, he says "Pull over"! Harry: What? State Trooper: Pull over!!! Harry: realizes he's holding beer bottles that Lloyd urinated in; shows his sweater No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing ! Lloyd: Yeah, killer boots, man! What IS AWESOMER THAN THAT !?!?!?! Harry: So you got fired again, eh? Lloyd: Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know? Harry: Yeah, well, I lost my job too. Lloyd: Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Harry: No, none taken. You know what really chaps my a** though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred. Lloyd: Hey, chicks love it. It's a shagging' wagon.

    This was the first movie i ever watched and i am glad that my parents let me!Now obviously at the age of three i didn't understand most of the humor such as, Harry putting the snowman's face to resemble its genitals, or Mary's breasts resembling car headlights (I just thought she was robotic!).But still without understanding those hilarious scenes, i still watched this movie almost four times a week!I enjoyed laughing at Harry making a noisy bowel movement, and Lloyd and Harry's sing-a-long in the car!If you love films making fun of dimwits but also embracing them, you will love this film! Even the banter between Harry and Lloyd is enough for me to give this film a SOLID 9! So do yourself a favor and watch this film.

    This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. I'm a guy who is, well,essentially a snob when it comes to films, preferring foreign, dark dramas or Woody Allen flicks (my exception is Zombies...go figure!) BUT how I missed this until now is beyond me. Just caught it last night - performances are brilliant/funny... Physical/verbal comedy...plot twists...genuinely hysterical. Even thought it's 20 plus years old, it holds up well. I read that there is a sequel in the works, and whether or not that's a good idea is hard to say. I will say based on THIS film I'll shell out my 12 bucks to see a sequel with a room full of fans. By the way, this is NOT for kids - even thought the characters are cartoons essentially - the humor would surely be missed on most them.

    As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his "wheelhouse" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here. Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect "ride". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a "straight-man" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs. This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the "cool" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of "cool" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy "buddy movies"! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result. Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the "crown" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.

    Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all. All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.

    Don't let the title of the movie fool you, Dumb & Dumber explains exactly who the two main characters of the movie are; Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) & Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels). They are so out of sorts from the norm that all the basics of everyday life they encounter in this movie turns into a triumph of one-liners that can be used in your everyday life. Watching this movie takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride across the country following Lloyd & Harry. Not only are you following this two dumb characters along the way, but you are following a story that keeps you intrigued until the ending credits. Without letting too much out, I encourage everyone to watch this movie that has endless laugh out loud moments and quirky lines that will keep you talking about this film for years to come.

    Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as "Yes Man" and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in "Ace Ventura Pet Detective." While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

    Lloyd and Harry are two very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver the case to her personally. However, Mary isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case..... Almost twenty years ago, this was comedy gold. Carrey was the biggest thing on the planet (The Mask and Ace Ventura were huge hits), and this was a really different type of comedy, never really seen before, so it was a huge success. Watching it now, knowing that The Farellys haven't done anything of note since 2000, and Carrey since 2003, the film is still good, but you really tend to focus more on Daniels, because he really plays against type in this, and he steals the film from Carrey. Its a simple premise, but the high concept of the two being 'dumb' is just great, and makes a simple premise all the more interesting. Supporting characters are just as funny, and some key scenes play out as sketches, which are funny standalone. So all in all, its a great comedy, and moved the genre a notch or two up, and paved the way of comedy for the next few years...

    I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny. This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the "Pull over" joke ("That's a cardigan!"), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, "I beg your pardon?" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the "pull over" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good. Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.

    IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spolier- State Trooper: Harry is driving fast and a cop is behind him and Lloyd, he says "Pull over"! Harry: What? State Trooper: Pull over!!! Harry: realizes he's holding beer bottles that Lloyd urinated in; shows his sweater No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing ! Lloyd: Yeah, killer boots, man! What IS AWESOMER THAN THAT !?!?!?! Harry: So you got fired again, eh? Lloyd: Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know? Harry: Yeah, well, I lost my job too. Lloyd: Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Harry: No, none taken. You know what really chaps my a** though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred. Lloyd: Hey, chicks love it. It's a shagging' wagon.

    This was the first movie i ever watched and i am glad that my parents let me!Now obviously at the age of three i didn't understand most of the humor such as, Harry putting the snowman's face to resemble its genitals, or Mary's breasts resembling car headlights (I just thought she was robotic!).But still without understanding those hilarious scenes, i still watched this movie almost four times a week!I enjoyed laughing at Harry making a noisy bowel movement, and Lloyd and Harry's sing-a-long in the car!If you love films making fun of dimwits but also embracing them, you will love this film! Even the banter between Harry and Lloyd is enough for me to give this film a SOLID 9! So do yourself a favor and watch this film.

    This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. I'm a guy who is, well,essentially a snob when it comes to films, preferring foreign, dark dramas or Woody Allen flicks (my exception is Zombies...go figure!) BUT how I missed this until now is beyond me. Just caught it last night - performances are brilliant/funny... Physical/verbal comedy...plot twists...genuinely hysterical. Even thought it's 20 plus years old, it holds up well. I read that there is a sequel in the works, and whether or not that's a good idea is hard to say. I will say based on THIS film I'll shell out my 12 bucks to see a sequel with a room full of fans. By the way, this is NOT for kids - even thought the characters are cartoons essentially - the humor would surely be missed on most them.

    As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his "wheelhouse" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here. Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect "ride". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a "straight-man" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs. This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the "cool" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of "cool" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy "buddy movies"! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result. Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the "crown" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.

    Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all. All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.

    Don't let the title of the movie fool you, Dumb & Dumber explains exactly who the two main characters of the movie are; Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) & Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels). They are so out of sorts from the norm that all the basics of everyday life they encounter in this movie turns into a triumph of one-liners that can be used in your everyday life. Watching this movie takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride across the country following Lloyd & Harry. Not only are you following this two dumb characters along the way, but you are following a story that keeps you intrigued until the ending credits. Without letting too much out, I encourage everyone to watch this movie that has endless laugh out loud moments and quirky lines that will keep you talking about this film for years to come.

    Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as "Yes Man" and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in "Ace Ventura Pet Detective." While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

    Lloyd and Harry are two very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver the case to her personally. However, Mary isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case..... Almost twenty years ago, this was comedy gold. Carrey was the biggest thing on the planet (The Mask and Ace Ventura were huge hits), and this was a really different type of comedy, never really seen before, so it was a huge success. Watching it now, knowing that The Farellys haven't done anything of note since 2000, and Carrey since 2003, the film is still good, but you really tend to focus more on Daniels, because he really plays against type in this, and he steals the film from Carrey. Its a simple premise, but the high concept of the two being 'dumb' is just great, and makes a simple premise all the more interesting. Supporting characters are just as funny, and some key scenes play out as sketches, which are funny standalone. So all in all, its a great comedy, and moved the genre a notch or two up, and paved the way of comedy for the next few years...

    I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny. This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the "Pull over" joke ("That's a cardigan!"), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, "I beg your pardon?" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the "pull over" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good. Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.

    IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Spolier- State Trooper: Harry is driving fast and a cop is behind him and Lloyd, he says "Pull over"! Harry: What? State Trooper: Pull over!!! Harry: realizes he's holding beer bottles that Lloyd urinated in; shows his sweater No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing ! Lloyd: Yeah, killer boots, man! What IS AWESOMER THAN THAT !?!?!?! Harry: So you got fired again, eh? Lloyd: Oh yeah. They always freak out when you leave the scene of an accident, you know? Harry: Yeah, well, I lost my job too. Lloyd: Man, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Harry: No, none taken. You know what really chaps my a** though? I spent my life savings turning my van into a dog. The alarm alone cost me two hundred. Lloyd: Hey, chicks love it. It's a shagging' wagon.

    This was the first movie i ever watched and i am glad that my parents let me!Now obviously at the age of three i didn't understand most of the humor such as, Harry putting the snowman's face to resemble its genitals, or Mary's breasts resembling car headlights (I just thought she was robotic!).But still without understanding those hilarious scenes, i still watched this movie almost four times a week!I enjoyed laughing at Harry making a noisy bowel movement, and Lloyd and Harry's sing-a-long in the car!If you love films making fun of dimwits but also embracing them, you will love this film! Even the banter between Harry and Lloyd is enough for me to give this film a SOLID 9! So do yourself a favor and watch this film.

    This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. I'm a guy who is, well,essentially a snob when it comes to films, preferring foreign, dark dramas or Woody Allen flicks (my exception is Zombies...go figure!) BUT how I missed this until now is beyond me. Just caught it last night - performances are brilliant/funny... Physical/verbal comedy...plot twists...genuinely hysterical. Even thought it's 20 plus years old, it holds up well. I read that there is a sequel in the works, and whether or not that's a good idea is hard to say. I will say based on THIS film I'll shell out my 12 bucks to see a sequel with a room full of fans. By the way, this is NOT for kids - even thought the characters are cartoons essentially - the humor would surely be missed on most them.

    As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his "wheelhouse" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here. Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect "ride". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a "straight-man" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs. This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the "cool" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of "cool" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy "buddy movies"! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result. Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the "crown" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce.

    Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all. All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.

    Don't let the title of the movie fool you, Dumb & Dumber explains exactly who the two main characters of the movie are; Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) & Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels). They are so out of sorts from the norm that all the basics of everyday life they encounter in this movie turns into a triumph of one-liners that can be used in your everyday life. Watching this movie takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride across the country following Lloyd & Harry. Not only are you following this two dumb characters along the way, but you are following a story that keeps you intrigued until the ending credits. Without letting too much out, I encourage everyone to watch this movie that has endless laugh out loud moments and quirky lines that will keep you talking about this film for years to come.

    Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as "Yes Man" and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in "Ace Ventura Pet Detective." While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.

    Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers. Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.
