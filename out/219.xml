    I have a confession. I'm a sucker for slasher movies. So maybe this isn't a totally objective opinion. But if this film isn't a classic horror movie I don't know what is! The premise is famous: the dreaded killer Freddy Krueger stalks teenagers in their dreams. There are a lot of iconic scenes, such as the bed that swallows a person whole, or Freddy's stretching arms, or the girl who's dragged violently across the ceiling. That last one is actually really haunting and looks good even on today's standards. Practical effects just have that magic to them. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the hairdos scream 80's fashion, as do the clothes, and the dialog is a bit cheesy, but I feel all these elements serve to create an enjoyably familiar and entertaining setting of comic horror.

    For me Seeing A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET back in 1984 was a thrill.Director Wes Craven was able to make us believe in the bogeyman played by talented actor Robert Englund who was at his best as the creepy and terrifying Freddy Kruger. It definitely had an impact on me to love scary films even more. They storyline was good and very entertaining. Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON. I highly recommend it especially if you love 80's Horror films.Good direction by Wes Craven and keep your eye on a very young Johnny Depp in his first role.

    I can't believe it's taken me this long to see this movie. I haven't seen any sequels etc either. I always thought I'd hate it but I think I had the wrong impression of what it was like. I found it hugely entertaining and even funny in parts. It wasn't quite as scary or shocking as I'd always imagined it would be but it's still frightening enough. The villain is fantastic - I love his "sense of humor" and the scary but slightly funny chase scenes. I absolutely loved this movie and the debut of Johnny Depp (I had no idea he was in this flick) is icing on the cake. What a little cutie he was LOL Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!! Don't hesitate to watch this - even if you're a squeamish - it's only a little bit gory!!

    Without a doubt this is one of my favorites. Also this is the scariest one in the entire series. Although New Nightmare was scary but not as scary as this one. Also the acting is fantastic and features a great cast of actors who later became big stars after this film. Including a young Johnny Depp which this is his very first film. Also i ain't gonna lie i think Heather Langenkamp is hot in this and she's even hot in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and even New Nightmare she is a total hot girl and one of my favorite hot girls of horror films. Also Robert Englund is without a doubt the best Freddy Krueger. Although Jackie Earle Haley did good as Freddy Krueger for the remake but not as good as Robert Englund he is the Freddy Krueger and always will be. This film used to scare me in the past around the time i first watched it. But after awhile i got used to it after watching it over and over again. And it never gets old i can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Because it is such a classic horror film. And definitely is a must own for horror fans out there.

    Considering I've wanted to watch this film for a ludicrously long time, when I finally had the chance to see it, I couldn't have been more excited. I was about to see this legendary horror film that everyone regards as one of the best ever made. However, the further I got into the film the more disappointed I became. Honestly, this has such an intriguing and amazing premise for a slasher film yet I feel as if Wes craven didn't take it far enough. The killer in this film enters peoples dreams and then murders them while they sleep, in all kinds of grotesque and unbelievable ways, but, I found this film to be lacking. Wes Craven is definitely not a great film maker, He has only made two films that are passable, this and scream. The dream sequences in this could have been much more imaginative and not so bland. I found the drama and character development to be underdone, I didn't care about these characters, especially the female one, mostly because she is your typical teenage slasher film heroine. The ending I thought was silly and poorly executed. I don't recommend this film.

    This is what I call "extreme supernatural slashers". Great movie with a great story. The only thing what makes the whole movie (for me) a little worse, instead of 10/10, 9/10 is that sometimes it's kind of "to easy" to beat Freddy, the movie killer. I mean, not like really easy, he's just "not so strong" and he's completely powerless in reality. But the good thing is also, that Freddy can kill you in your dreams, that means you are extremely powerless when escaping away from him. It's his world and you're trapped inside. But when you pull him out of his world, it's way to easy to beat him as i already mentioned. Also, the way of killing in this movie is pretty great. Like, totally bloody and really original. (I won't reveal parts, cause then it will be a spoiler). So when i was watching that movie, it was really great but still not as good as Halloween or Friday the 13. But i must say, that 2010 remake of that movie (no offense) sucked..

    I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader. Anyone looking for a horror movie that will honestly terrify you, watch this, lights out, speakers full blast, see if you don't freak out when you're by yourself.

    - A- This is an excellent slasher film. It has one of the best villains with a cool idea for the film. Freddy is a very unique villain as he is portrayed as a crazy psycho with a clawed glove as his weapon. His facial features are cool and his outfit is different as it is a normal outfit that could be worn by any person, not a psycho maniac. The lead acting is okay and the blood is over the top crazy at times. The whole climax is confusing and hard to follow as some things don't make sense for why they happen and that's probably what kept it from being an A film but the final scene is good as it helps state whether its real or fake. This is an excellent film.

    Wes Craven has made some brilliant horror films in his time, but this is definitely his best. Nancy Thompson and her friends are stalked by a deranged serial killer, but instead of the original plot line of this happening in real life, they're being hunted when they're at their most vulnerable. Including Johnny Depp in his first ever performance (Although you really won't recognise him!), this movie will take your breathe away, and really, I'm not exaggerating! Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!

    Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions. Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother. There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since. With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.

And it never gets old i can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Because it is such a classic horror film. And definitely is a must own for horror fans out there.

    Considering I've wanted to watch this film for a ludicrously long time, when I finally had the chance to see it, I couldn't have been more excited. I was about to see this legendary horror film that everyone regards as one of the best ever made. However, the further I got into the film the more disappointed I became. Honestly, this has such an intriguing and amazing premise for a slasher film yet I feel as if Wes craven didn't take it far enough. The killer in this film enters peoples dreams and then murders them while they sleep, in all kinds of grotesque and unbelievable ways, but, I found this film to be lacking. Wes Craven is definitely not a great film maker, He has only made two films that are passable, this and scream. The dream sequences in this could have been much more imaginative and not so bland. I found the drama and character development to be underdone, I didn't care about these characters, especially the female one, mostly because she is your typical teenage slasher film heroine. The ending I thought was silly and poorly executed. I don't recommend this film.

    This is what I call "extreme supernatural slashers". Great movie with a great story. The only thing what makes the whole movie (for me) a little worse, instead of 10/10, 9/10 is that sometimes it's kind of "to easy" to beat Freddy, the movie killer. I mean, not like really easy, he's just "not so strong" and he's completely powerless in reality. But the good thing is also, that Freddy can kill you in your dreams, that means you are extremely powerless when escaping away from him. It's his world and you're trapped inside. But when you pull him out of his world, it's way to easy to beat him as i already mentioned. Also, the way of killing in this movie is pretty great. Like, totally bloody and really original. (I won't reveal parts, cause then it will be a spoiler). So when i was watching that movie, it was really great but still not as good as Halloween or Friday the 13. But i must say, that 2010 remake of that movie (no offense) sucked..

    I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader. Anyone looking for a horror movie that will honestly terrify you, watch this, lights out, speakers full blast, see if you don't freak out when you're by yourself.

    - A- This is an excellent slasher film. It has one of the best villains with a cool idea for the film. Freddy is a very unique villain as he is portrayed as a crazy psycho with a clawed glove as his weapon. His facial features are cool and his outfit is different as it is a normal outfit that could be worn by any person, not a psycho maniac. The lead acting is okay and the blood is over the top crazy at times. The whole climax is confusing and hard to follow as some things don't make sense for why they happen and that's probably what kept it from being an A film but the final scene is good as it helps state whether its real or fake. This is an excellent film.

    Wes Craven has made some brilliant horror films in his time, but this is definitely his best. Nancy Thompson and her friends are stalked by a deranged serial killer, but instead of the original plot line of this happening in real life, they're being hunted when they're at their most vulnerable. Including Johnny Depp in his first ever performance (Although you really won't recognise him!), this movie will take your breathe away, and really, I'm not exaggerating! Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!

    Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions. Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother. There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since. With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.

    I have a confession. I'm a sucker for slasher movies. So maybe this isn't a totally objective opinion. But if this film isn't a classic horror movie I don't know what is! The premise is famous: the dreaded killer Freddy Krueger stalks teenagers in their dreams. There are a lot of iconic scenes, such as the bed that swallows a person whole, or Freddy's stretching arms, or the girl who's dragged violently across the ceiling. That last one is actually really haunting and looks good even on today's standards. Practical effects just have that magic to them. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the hairdos scream 80's fashion, as do the clothes, and the dialog is a bit cheesy, but I feel all these elements serve to create an enjoyably familiar and entertaining setting of comic horror.

    For me Seeing A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET back in 1984 was a thrill.Director Wes Craven was able to make us believe in the bogeyman played by talented actor Robert Englund who was at his best as the creepy and terrifying Freddy Kruger. It definitely had an impact on me to love scary films even more. They storyline was good and very entertaining. Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON. I highly recommend it especially if you love 80's Horror films.Good direction by Wes Craven and keep your eye on a very young Johnny Depp in his first role.

    I can't believe it's taken me this long to see this movie. I haven't seen any sequels etc either. I always thought I'd hate it but I think I had the wrong impression of what it was like. I found it hugely entertaining and even funny in parts. It wasn't quite as scary or shocking as I'd always imagined it would be but it's still frightening enough. The villain is fantastic - I love his "sense of humor" and the scary but slightly funny chase scenes. I absolutely loved this movie and the debut of Johnny Depp (I had no idea he was in this flick) is icing on the cake. What a little cutie he was LOL Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!! Don't hesitate to watch this - even if you're a squeamish - it's only a little bit gory!!

    Without a doubt this is one of my favorites. Also this is the scariest one in the entire series. Although New Nightmare was scary but not as scary as this one. Also the acting is fantastic and features a great cast of actors who later became big stars after this film. Including a young Johnny Depp which this is his very first film. Also i ain't gonna lie i think Heather Langenkamp is hot in this and she's even hot in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and even New Nightmare she is a total hot girl and one of my favorite hot girls of horror films. Also Robert Englund is without a doubt the best Freddy Krueger. Although Jackie Earle Haley did good as Freddy Krueger for the remake but not as good as Robert Englund he is the Freddy Krueger and always will be. This film used to scare me in the past around the time i first watched it. But after awhile i got used to it after watching it over and over again.

Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!

    Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions. Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother. There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since. With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.

    I have a confession. I'm a sucker for slasher movies. So maybe this isn't a totally objective opinion. But if this film isn't a classic horror movie I don't know what is! The premise is famous: the dreaded killer Freddy Krueger stalks teenagers in their dreams. There are a lot of iconic scenes, such as the bed that swallows a person whole, or Freddy's stretching arms, or the girl who's dragged violently across the ceiling. That last one is actually really haunting and looks good even on today's standards. Practical effects just have that magic to them. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the hairdos scream 80's fashion, as do the clothes, and the dialog is a bit cheesy, but I feel all these elements serve to create an enjoyably familiar and entertaining setting of comic horror.

    For me Seeing A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET back in 1984 was a thrill.Director Wes Craven was able to make us believe in the bogeyman played by talented actor Robert Englund who was at his best as the creepy and terrifying Freddy Kruger. It definitely had an impact on me to love scary films even more. They storyline was good and very entertaining. Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON. I highly recommend it especially if you love 80's Horror films.Good direction by Wes Craven and keep your eye on a very young Johnny Depp in his first role.

    I can't believe it's taken me this long to see this movie. I haven't seen any sequels etc either. I always thought I'd hate it but I think I had the wrong impression of what it was like. I found it hugely entertaining and even funny in parts. It wasn't quite as scary or shocking as I'd always imagined it would be but it's still frightening enough. The villain is fantastic - I love his "sense of humor" and the scary but slightly funny chase scenes. I absolutely loved this movie and the debut of Johnny Depp (I had no idea he was in this flick) is icing on the cake. What a little cutie he was LOL Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!!

    Without a doubt this is one of my favorites. Also this is the scariest one in the entire series. Although New Nightmare was scary but not as scary as this one. Also the acting is fantastic and features a great cast of actors who later became big stars after this film. Including a young Johnny Depp which this is his very first film. Also i ain't gonna lie i think Heather Langenkamp is hot in this and she's even hot in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and even New Nightmare she is a total hot girl and one of my favorite hot girls of horror films. Also Robert Englund is without a doubt the best Freddy Krueger. Although Jackie Earle Haley did good as Freddy Krueger for the remake but not as good as Robert Englund he is the Freddy Krueger and always will be. This film used to scare me in the past around the time i first watched it. But after awhile i got used to it after watching it over and over again. And it never gets old i can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Because it is such a classic horror film. And definitely is a must own for horror fans out there.

    Considering I've wanted to watch this film for a ludicrously long time, when I finally had the chance to see it, I couldn't have been more excited. I was about to see this legendary horror film that everyone regards as one of the best ever made. However, the further I got into the film the more disappointed I became. Honestly, this has such an intriguing and amazing premise for a slasher film yet I feel as if Wes craven didn't take it far enough. The killer in this film enters peoples dreams and then murders them while they sleep, in all kinds of grotesque and unbelievable ways, but, I found this film to be lacking. Wes Craven is definitely not a great film maker, He has only made two films that are passable, this and scream. The dream sequences in this could have been much more imaginative and not so bland. I found the drama and character development to be underdone, I didn't care about these characters, especially the female one, mostly because she is your typical teenage slasher film heroine. The ending I thought was silly and poorly executed. I don't recommend this film.

    This is what I call "extreme supernatural slashers". Great movie with a great story. The only thing what makes the whole movie (for me) a little worse, instead of 10/10, 9/10 is that sometimes it's kind of "to easy" to beat Freddy, the movie killer. I mean, not like really easy, he's just "not so strong" and he's completely powerless in reality. But the good thing is also, that Freddy can kill you in your dreams, that means you are extremely powerless when escaping away from him. It's his world and you're trapped inside. But when you pull him out of his world, it's way to easy to beat him as i already mentioned. Also, the way of killing in this movie is pretty great. Like, totally bloody and really original. (I won't reveal parts, cause then it will be a spoiler). So when i was watching that movie, it was really great but still not as good as Halloween or Friday the 13. But i must say, that 2010 remake of that movie (no offense) sucked..

    I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader. Anyone looking for a horror movie that will honestly terrify you, watch this, lights out, speakers full blast, see if you don't freak out when you're by yourself.

    - A- This is an excellent slasher film. It has one of the best villains with a cool idea for the film. Freddy is a very unique villain as he is portrayed as a crazy psycho with a clawed glove as his weapon. His facial features are cool and his outfit is different as it is a normal outfit that could be worn by any person, not a psycho maniac. The lead acting is okay and the blood is over the top crazy at times. The whole climax is confusing and hard to follow as some things don't make sense for why they happen and that's probably what kept it from being an A film but the final scene is good as it helps state whether its real or fake. This is an excellent film.

Also i ain't gonna lie i think Heather Langenkamp is hot in this and she's even hot in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and even New Nightmare she is a total hot girl and one of my favorite hot girls of horror films. Also Robert Englund is without a doubt the best Freddy Krueger. Although Jackie Earle Haley did good as Freddy Krueger for the remake but not as good as Robert Englund he is the Freddy Krueger and always will be. This film used to scare me in the past around the time i first watched it. But after awhile i got used to it after watching it over and over again. And it never gets old i can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Because it is such a classic horror film. And definitely is a must own for horror fans out there.

    Considering I've wanted to watch this film for a ludicrously long time, when I finally had the chance to see it, I couldn't have been more excited. I was about to see this legendary horror film that everyone regards as one of the best ever made. However, the further I got into the film the more disappointed I became. Honestly, this has such an intriguing and amazing premise for a slasher film yet I feel as if Wes craven didn't take it far enough. The killer in this film enters peoples dreams and then murders them while they sleep, in all kinds of grotesque and unbelievable ways, but, I found this film to be lacking. Wes Craven is definitely not a great film maker, He has only made two films that are passable, this and scream. The dream sequences in this could have been much more imaginative and not so bland. I found the drama and character development to be underdone, I didn't care about these characters, especially the female one, mostly because she is your typical teenage slasher film heroine. The ending I thought was silly and poorly executed. I don't recommend this film.

    This is what I call "extreme supernatural slashers". Great movie with a great story. The only thing what makes the whole movie (for me) a little worse, instead of 10/10, 9/10 is that sometimes it's kind of "to easy" to beat Freddy, the movie killer. I mean, not like really easy, he's just "not so strong" and he's completely powerless in reality. But the good thing is also, that Freddy can kill you in your dreams, that means you are extremely powerless when escaping away from him. It's his world and you're trapped inside. But when you pull him out of his world, it's way to easy to beat him as i already mentioned. Also, the way of killing in this movie is pretty great. Like, totally bloody and really original. (I won't reveal parts, cause then it will be a spoiler). So when i was watching that movie, it was really great but still not as good as Halloween or Friday the 13. But i must say, that 2010 remake of that movie (no offense) sucked..

    I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader. Anyone looking for a horror movie that will honestly terrify you, watch this, lights out, speakers full blast, see if you don't freak out when you're by yourself.

    - A- This is an excellent slasher film. It has one of the best villains with a cool idea for the film. Freddy is a very unique villain as he is portrayed as a crazy psycho with a clawed glove as his weapon. His facial features are cool and his outfit is different as it is a normal outfit that could be worn by any person, not a psycho maniac. The lead acting is okay and the blood is over the top crazy at times. The whole climax is confusing and hard to follow as some things don't make sense for why they happen and that's probably what kept it from being an A film but the final scene is good as it helps state whether its real or fake. This is an excellent film.

    Wes Craven has made some brilliant horror films in his time, but this is definitely his best. Nancy Thompson and her friends are stalked by a deranged serial killer, but instead of the original plot line of this happening in real life, they're being hunted when they're at their most vulnerable. Including Johnny Depp in his first ever performance (Although you really won't recognise him!), this movie will take your breathe away, and really, I'm not exaggerating! Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!

    Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions. Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother. There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since. With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.

    I have a confession. I'm a sucker for slasher movies. So maybe this isn't a totally objective opinion. But if this film isn't a classic horror movie I don't know what is! The premise is famous: the dreaded killer Freddy Krueger stalks teenagers in their dreams. There are a lot of iconic scenes, such as the bed that swallows a person whole, or Freddy's stretching arms, or the girl who's dragged violently across the ceiling. That last one is actually really haunting and looks good even on today's standards. Practical effects just have that magic to them. The acting is a bit over-the-top, the hairdos scream 80's fashion, as do the clothes, and the dialog is a bit cheesy, but I feel all these elements serve to create an enjoyably familiar and entertaining setting of comic horror.

    For me Seeing A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET back in 1984 was a thrill.Director Wes Craven was able to make us believe in the bogeyman played by talented actor Robert Englund who was at his best as the creepy and terrifying Freddy Kruger. It definitely had an impact on me to love scary films even more. They storyline was good and very entertaining. Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON. I highly recommend it especially if you love 80's Horror films.Good direction by Wes Craven and keep your eye on a very young Johnny Depp in his first role.

    I can't believe it's taken me this long to see this movie. I haven't seen any sequels etc either. I always thought I'd hate it but I think I had the wrong impression of what it was like. I found it hugely entertaining and even funny in parts. It wasn't quite as scary or shocking as I'd always imagined it would be but it's still frightening enough. The villain is fantastic - I love his "sense of humor" and the scary but slightly funny chase scenes. I absolutely loved this movie and the debut of Johnny Depp (I had no idea he was in this flick) is icing on the cake. What a little cutie he was LOL Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!! Don't hesitate to watch this - even if you're a squeamish - it's only a little bit gory!!

    Wes Craven has made some brilliant horror films in his time, but this is definitely his best. Nancy Thompson and her friends are stalked by a deranged serial killer, but instead of the original plot line of this happening in real life, they're being hunted when they're at their most vulnerable. Including Johnny Depp in his first ever performance (Although you really won't recognise him!), this movie will take your breathe away, and really, I'm not exaggerating! Overall, amazing music, lots of jump scenes, outstanding special effects for the time it was made (and still great today), a story line that nobody has ever thought of before and great acting, this movie has got to be one of my favourites of all time, and not just horror. Well done Wes Craven! You're a genius!

    Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions. Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother. There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status. Craven delivered a novel concept and villain which has been imitated many times since. With an assortment of slasher, fantasy and horror - nightmare mixed with reality has never been quite equalled since.
