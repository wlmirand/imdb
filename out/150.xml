    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters.

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it. The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done. The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised. When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good. 3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com

    Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets. But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger. Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly  and is  but it never seemed cooler. Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say "Ohhh behave!" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice. Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped. The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher. Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen  even if they don't want to. The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man). The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party. The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt. It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'. Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since. In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching. Final Rating  8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6  just another movie with a couple of chuckles  with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention. Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.

    In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea. The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.

    In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money. Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.

    Written by Jon Favreau in just two weeks, the screenplay to Swingers is nevertheless an excellent debut. And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that it made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90s. Coincidently, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on. It is quintessentially a man's film, yet it has just enough realistic romance to also make it appealing to a certain type of women, the intelligent and sophisticated ones. Highly recommended!

    This is a great movie! Towards the middle of the movie, you really start to care about Mike and feel sympathy towards him. I really like the proverbial journey that the audience goes through of seeing him, side-by-side with his friend, Trent, go through internal obstacles and get over the painful breakup with the girlfriend he once had. My favorite part is where Ron Livingston's character does a monologue about being in L.A. and moving on with your life, by thinking about the stuff you do have. Keep your eyes peeled for this scene. Overall, it's an excellent low-budget film and it keeps you hooked on, until the ending.

    Hyperactive airhead ramblings of Trent, a plot that was deflating, content with punchlines that mainly felt like a slap with an empty bin liner. There was potential in this movie but it flew down the strip like a dragster with only one cylinder firing fuelled by doughnut oil (or "chip fat" for my fellow Brits). Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three. I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn. Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way. The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.

    Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life. Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways. This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results. This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that "So money!" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

    "The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it." Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.&nbsp; Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and "rules" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) &nbsp;Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.&nbsp; I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.

    This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging. The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene. So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too.
