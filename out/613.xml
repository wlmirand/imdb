 <sinopse>
  A scatterbrained socialite hires a vagrant as a family butler...but there's more to Godfrey than meets the eye.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the depths of the Depression, a party game brings dizzy socialite Irene Bullock to the city dump where she meets Godfrey, a derelict, and ends by hiring him as family butler. He finds the Bullocks to be the epitome of idle rich, and nutty as the proverbial fruitcake. Soon, the dramatizing Irene is in love with her 'protege'...who feels strongly that a romance between servant and employer is out of place, regardless of that servant's mysterious past...

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

    "My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

    I loved this movie! It was so easy to watch, I was not bored at all during this movie. From the start of the movie it was hilarious. I thought that I would be able to predict the movie from the start but it really fooled me. I loved the way everything played out, the storyline was great, I thought it was quite clever!! The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!

    This film is perfect, classic, feel-good comedy. There were few moments during this movie when I was smiling my face off. This film was witty, charming, clever, inspiring, adorable, and just hilarious. It was easy to fall for these characters, they were so well portrayed. And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

    I loved this movie! It was so easy to watch, I was not bored at all during this movie. From the start of the movie it was hilarious. I thought that I would be able to predict the movie from the start but it really fooled me. I loved the way everything played out, the storyline was great, I thought it was quite clever!! The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!

    This film is perfect, classic, feel-good comedy. There were few moments during this movie when I was smiling my face off. This film was witty, charming, clever, inspiring, adorable, and just hilarious. It was easy to fall for these characters, they were so well portrayed. And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

    "My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

    I loved this movie! It was so easy to watch, I was not bored at all during this movie. From the start of the movie it was hilarious. I thought that I would be able to predict the movie from the start but it really fooled me. I loved the way everything played out, the storyline was great, I thought it was quite clever!! The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!

    This film is perfect, classic, feel-good comedy. There were few moments during this movie when I was smiling my face off. This film was witty, charming, clever, inspiring, adorable, and just hilarious. It was easy to fall for these characters, they were so well portrayed. And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

    "My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!

    This film is perfect, classic, feel-good comedy. There were few moments during this movie when I was smiling my face off. This film was witty, charming, clever, inspiring, adorable, and just hilarious. It was easy to fall for these characters, they were so well portrayed. And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

    "My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

I thought that I would be able to predict the movie from the start but it really fooled me. I loved the way everything played out, the storyline was great, I thought it was quite clever!! The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!

    This film is perfect, classic, feel-good comedy. There were few moments during this movie when I was smiling my face off. This film was witty, charming, clever, inspiring, adorable, and just hilarious. It was easy to fall for these characters, they were so well portrayed. And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

And even someone new to the older genres such as myself can really appreciate the camera work and attention to detail throughout this film. The acting was amazing and the story was rather brilliant. Though I did feel odd about the way it ended out with the love interest but it didn't really bother me too much. Overall I just really enjoyed this film and at some point hope to watch it again.

    My Man Godfrey is an wonderfully over the top screwball that gives nothing but laughs. Each actor has their own sort of uniquely obnoxious way that brings the film together. Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.

    This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Janurov&aacute;, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.

    Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "prot&eacute;g&eacute;" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.

    I found this movie pleasantly surprising although there were some things that I did not enjoy. One great thing about the movie was the comedy. The film had some extremely funny moments. All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.

    Gregory La Cava's "My Man Godfrey" is a great example for how movies used to be mad. A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.

    "My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish d&eacute;cor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.

    The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    Such a great movie, it is hard to find comedies that you can really sit back and enjoy every aspect of it. This movie gave out a strong message as well as a great story line at the same time. The characters knew how to act and catch the viewers attention, the interactions between Godfrey and Irene were believable and almost always amusing. Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.

    I loved this movie! It was so easy to watch, I was not bored at all during this movie. From the start of the movie it was hilarious. I thought that I would be able to predict the movie from the start but it really fooled me. I loved the way everything played out, the storyline was great, I thought it was quite clever!! The characters in the movie were so funny, they were sort of over dramatic, but not in a annoying tacky way. I probably could watch this movie over and over again and laugh just has hard every time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different love story or to anyone who is looking for a good laugh!
