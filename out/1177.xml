 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Robert's a beleaguered concierge of the luxury hotel owned by Mrs. Dubrow. She tells Robert an undercover reviewer is coming and to look sharp. If he does well he might get a promotion and some time off to take his sons, Brian and Kyle, on vacation.

And when Dunston gets loose and tries to escape a life of crime with the help of Brian and Kyle, things go just a little lunatic.

    Searching round on Amazon UK for a good,live-action family film to watch during the holiday season,I was surprise to discover a family movie from the mid 90's,that starred Faye Dunaway and Jason "George from Seinfeld" Alexander!.Which led to me deciding,that for this season,I would go and cheek in with Dunston. The plot: Being told by the owner of The Majestic hotel,that he has to make sure the quality at the hotel is absolutely perfect,due to the hotel epecting an impestctor to secretly pay them a visit,and hopefully give them a 6th star.Taking hotel owner Mrs Dubrow's words to heart,hotel manager Robert Grant begins to solely focus on making the hotel's upcoming ball the best that it has ever held As Robert begins to focus less on the current hotel guest,and more on arranging the ball,Grant's son Kyle,begins to suspect that one of the suitcases recently brought in by a new guest (called Lord Rustledge) actually contains something "secret",that will cause The Majestic Hotel a huge amount of trouble. View on the film: Whilst the screenplay by John Hopkins and Bruce Graham does rely on typical clich&eacute;s, (such as having Rupert Everett play an English,upper class twit) and also some pretty big plot holes. (where did the diamonds go?) The writer's smartly use the film's brisk 88 minute running time to smoothly cover most of the flaws,by having most of the film shown from Kyle's (played by a good Eric Lloyd) point of view,that helps it to go from a wonderfully slap-stick diamond heist adventure,into being a little bit more dramatic,as Kyle attempts to save his new friend from being hurt. Backed by delightful supporting performances from a boo-hiss Faye Dunaway and a bumbling,but well meaning Jason Alexander,director Ken Kwapis (who has since gone on to direct some brilliant episodes of the US Office) smartly makes Sam's (who sadly died of a heart attack in 2010) performance as Dunston the centre of the movie.For being his debut,Sam gives a wonderful performance that most humans can only dream of!,which goes from some genuinely hilarious moments,as Dunston is forced to do Lord Rustledge bidding,to giving the movie a huge dollop of charm in the scenes showing the growing friendship between Dunston and Kyle,which leads to this being a terrific legacy,that Sam should be proud to have left behind.

    I don't know about being better than Monkey Trouble, however it is UP THERE. "DCI" better known as Dunston Checks In, is by far one of the best movies ever. We all know monkeys have a special place in our hearts but Dunston manages to steal EVERYONES hearts, criminals and mean people alike. He gets in this silliest predicaments and can make a mess of anything! (But hey that's what monkeys do, right?) Anyways, at the movie-renting place (am I allowed to type Blockbuster?) tonight I was very tempted to rent this film, however, I had to stick with Baby's Day Out. But DCI has my vote for sure next movie night. To sum it up, if monkeys could speak, they'd be hollering "DCI!" for years to come.

    After a career entailing "Bonnie and Clyde", "Little Big Man", "Chinatown", "Three Days of the Condor" and "Network", might it seem really low for Faye Dunaway to act in a movie like "Dunston Checks In"? Maybe, but the movie pretty much understands what sort of movie it is: silly, harmless fun. As it is, Faye Dunaway plays the same kind of character that she played in "Network", only bitchier. And if it seems that I try too hard to analyze a movie like this, so be it. Above all, I still consider Faye Dunaway REALLY hot! And I'm sure that I always will. Also starring Jason Alexander, Rupert Everett and Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman).

    "DCI" has to be one of the stupidest, worst comedies ever혰nothing is funny; yet it is worth seeing for Mrs. Dunaway as a delicious blonde혰she looked delicious.She might be one of the finest looking women on the screen in the '90s. See,in this very film,her ass,her legs혰as much as they are visible.The rest of the cast is bad. Mrs. Dunaway is of course underused in such a film. Hope it doesn't sound too libidinous혰if you're interested in a comedy, it's rubbish; if you're interested in Mrs. Dunaway's derri&egrave;re, it might tempt you. (Anyway, do not look for too much, as Mrs. Dunaway's beauty is not really explored and exploited here.) From Faye, it's just funny, glamorous overplay.

    I have seen this movie it was a great movie. Sam as Dunston the orangutan was very cute. Jason Alexander as Robert Grant was very good at this film. Eric Loyd as Kyle Grant was very nice in this film. Paul Rebuns (pee wee) as Buck LaFarge was funny. Faye Dunaway as Mrs, Dubrow was very beautiful. Whats sad that Dunston has a piece of glass on his hand. Dunston was scared about his hand. Whats terrible that Dunston does not have Samson anymore. Jennifer Bassey as Mrs. Dellacroce was very nice. Glenn Shadix as Lionel Spalding is funny. Rupert Everett as Lord Rutledge was very interesting That movie is funny, cute, and great you will like this movie so does Dunston the orangutan.

    This is the sort of light caper that is nothing special but does provide some harmless fun for kids who will undoubtedly get more of a kick out of an Orangutan's shenanigans than an adult will--although there are some very clever moments that fill the bill for young and old. JASON Alexander is expert as a hotel manager with two bratty kids who seem to have nothing better to do than make mischief as they cavort around the hotel with an unexpected guest. Seems that a jewel thief (RUPERT EVERETT) has checked in with his pet who's been trained to steal. This sets up the structure of the plot which has the kids and the Orangutan as the main focus of attention. It's fun to see FAYE DUNAWAY enjoying herself in a comic role and everyone else enters nicely into the spirit of the whole thing. Easy to take and passes the time quickly with a few very clever moments among the many vignettes involving some cute stunts.

    A manager and his two sons live in a hotel. The sons must not go to school at all because they are always causing trouble in the hotel. It really bothered me that they didn't go to school. Anyway, the youngest son finds this ape and the ape is part of a jewelery robbery. The movie was similar to "Monkey Trouble" in the sense of stealing apes or monkeys. It was a pretty cute movie but it was cheesy too. In some parts, I just wanted to fire the father and in other parts I just felt sorry for him. The poor guy couldn't even get a vacation and on top of that he had this kids who were just brats. It was a heartwarming family kind of movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Watch it with a banana split.

    1995 and 1996 were clearly the years for movies dealing with primates. "Ed "in 1996 taught us that heroes come in all shapes, and all sizes. Congo (1995) taught us that apes could be both intelligent and evil. Let's not forget 1995's "Born to be Wild", where a teenage boy and female gorilla's near bestiality captured all our hearts. However, not since the original "Planet of Apes" has a movie captivated our attention, and made us feel what it's like to be a monkey. "Dunston Checks In" set the bar for years to come. Sam the orangutan's performance as Dunston is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Blockbuster actors such as Ben Affleck and James Franco could learn a lesson or two from Sam. You think Ben Affleck was emotional when he said "I love you" to Bruce Willis in Armageddon? Think again. When Sam looks at the picture of him and his now dead brother, his expression alone brings a tear to ones eye. You think James Franco was in pain in Spider-Man 2 when he realized his best friend was the man who killed his father? Try watching Sam when he is getting a piece of glass torn from his flesh. Sam's connection with the audience is so great you almost feel the glass being ripped from your own hand. This is not to mention the other wonderful qualities this movie has. Amazing slapstick comedy, alcoholic older women, Jason Alexander cursing, Faye Dunaway's fall from grace, an orangutan spanking a prominent socialite, and a cameo from Paul Reubens that can only be explained with two words: Oscar worthy. The fact that this film did not win any Academy Awards is shocking. Five for sure: Paul Reubens beating out Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Woods for Best Supporting Actor, "Dunston Checks In" narrowly defeating "The English Patient" for Best Picture, Ken Kwapis for Best Director, Best Music Robert Blackwell, and lastly, a landslide victory for Sam, the orangutan for Best Actor. It is criminal that the Academy shafted this great film in 1996 with no Oscars and zero nominations. Although it was given no Oscars this much can be certain: it set the standard and paved the way for future primate movies. Where would MVP: Most Vaulable Primate and MXP: Most Xtreme Primate be without Dunston Checks In? In some Hollywood executive's trash, that's where. Because of pioneer movies like "Dunston Checks In" movies like MVP and MXP enjoy much commercial success. So grab your kids, round up the neighbor, pop some popcorn, and get ready to laugh, and cry at one of the best movies in the last twenty years: "Dunston Checks In".

    This was surprisingly entertaining and with a few minor exceptions, very inoffensive family fare. It's another one of those adults-and-kids can enjoy flicks with a number of lines that border on being too much for kids but are still tame for adults - close, but safe. There are also some funny special effects and some good slapstick humor. Being basically a kids' film, the main child, played by Eric Lloyd is cute but a little too spoiled for me but he's tolerable, as is his brother. Jason Alexander is the father, a very likable subdued guy but a little too lenient. The real surprise in this cast is Faye Dunaway. Usually playing hard-edged types, she is the opposite in here which is kind of refreshing to see. She shows a nice comedic touch. The chimpanzee is probably the most entertaining, which is the idea, but so is the villain played by Rupert Evert. In other words, there are a lot of likable characters in this movie. This a "sleeper:" an underrated film that a lot of people would enjoy. I'm sorry it never got much "press."

    A little boy who lives in a luxurious hotel (his father, Jason Alexander, owns it) has no friends and lives a miserable life until a monkey (or, to be more accurate, an orangutan) walks in one day and becomes his new best buddy. Cue lots of stupid physical humor, shots of surprised guests shocked at the prospect of seeing a monkey in a rich hotel, more shots of disgust from the struggling father (Alexander doing his George Costanza), and Faye Dunaway looking old. This is a really terrible movie for children. It says that if you don't have any friends, you should get a monkey and be really destructive and ruin your father's business - because rich people suck.

    Searching round on Amazon UK for a good,live-action family film to watch during the holiday season,I was surprise to discover a family movie from the mid 90's,that starred Faye Dunaway and Jason "George from Seinfeld" Alexander!.Which led to me deciding,that for this season,I would go and cheek in with Dunston. The plot: Being told by the owner of The Majestic hotel,that he has to make sure the quality at the hotel is absolutely perfect,due to the hotel epecting an impestctor to secretly pay them a visit,and hopefully give them a 6th star.Taking hotel owner Mrs Dubrow's words to heart,hotel manager Robert Grant begins to solely focus on making the hotel's upcoming ball the best that it has ever held As Robert begins to focus less on the current hotel guest,and more on arranging the ball,Grant's son Kyle,begins to suspect that one of the suitcases recently brought in by a new guest (called Lord Rustledge) actually contains something "secret",that will cause The Majestic Hotel a huge amount of trouble. View on the film: Whilst the screenplay by John Hopkins and Bruce Graham does rely on typical clich&eacute;s, (such as having Rupert Everett play an English,upper class twit) and also some pretty big plot holes. (where did the diamonds go?) The writer's smartly use the film's brisk 88 minute running time to smoothly cover most of the flaws,by having most of the film shown from Kyle's (played by a good Eric Lloyd) point of view,that helps it to go from a wonderfully slap-stick diamond heist adventure,into being a little bit more dramatic,as Kyle attempts to save his new friend from being hurt. Backed by delightful supporting performances from a boo-hiss Faye Dunaway and a bumbling,but well meaning Jason Alexander,director Ken Kwapis (who has since gone on to direct some brilliant episodes of the US Office) smartly makes Sam's (who sadly died of a heart attack in 2010) performance as Dunston the centre of the movie.For being his debut,Sam gives a wonderful performance that most humans can only dream of!,which goes from some genuinely hilarious moments,as Dunston is forced to do Lord Rustledge bidding,to giving the movie a huge dollop of charm in the scenes showing the growing friendship between Dunston and Kyle,which leads to this being a terrific legacy,that Sam should be proud to have left behind.

    I don't know about being better than Monkey Trouble, however it is UP THERE. "DCI" better known as Dunston Checks In, is by far one of the best movies ever. We all know monkeys have a special place in our hearts but Dunston manages to steal EVERYONES hearts, criminals and mean people alike. He gets in this silliest predicaments and can make a mess of anything! (But hey that's what monkeys do, right?) Anyways, at the movie-renting place (am I allowed to type Blockbuster?) tonight I was very tempted to rent this film, however, I had to stick with Baby's Day Out. But DCI has my vote for sure next movie night. To sum it up, if monkeys could speak, they'd be hollering "DCI!" for years to come.

    After a career entailing "Bonnie and Clyde", "Little Big Man", "Chinatown", "Three Days of the Condor" and "Network", might it seem really low for Faye Dunaway to act in a movie like "Dunston Checks In"? Maybe, but the movie pretty much understands what sort of movie it is: silly, harmless fun. As it is, Faye Dunaway plays the same kind of character that she played in "Network", only bitchier. And if it seems that I try too hard to analyze a movie like this, so be it. Above all, I still consider Faye Dunaway REALLY hot! And I'm sure that I always will. Also starring Jason Alexander, Rupert Everett and Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman).

    "DCI" has to be one of the stupidest, worst comedies ever혰nothing is funny; yet it is worth seeing for Mrs. Dunaway as a delicious blonde혰she looked delicious.She might be one of the finest looking women on the screen in the '90s. See,in this very film,her ass,her legs혰as much as they are visible.The rest of the cast is bad. Mrs. Dunaway is of course underused in such a film. Hope it doesn't sound too libidinous혰if you're interested in a comedy, it's rubbish; if you're interested in Mrs. Dunaway's derri&egrave;re, it might tempt you. (Anyway, do not look for too much, as Mrs. Dunaway's beauty is not really explored and exploited here.) From Faye, it's just funny, glamorous overplay.

    I have seen this movie it was a great movie. Sam as Dunston the orangutan was very cute. Jason Alexander as Robert Grant was very good at this film. Eric Loyd as Kyle Grant was very nice in this film. Paul Rebuns (pee wee) as Buck LaFarge was funny. Faye Dunaway as Mrs, Dubrow was very beautiful. Whats sad that Dunston has a piece of glass on his hand. Dunston was scared about his hand. Whats terrible that Dunston does not have Samson anymore. Jennifer Bassey as Mrs. Dellacroce was very nice. Glenn Shadix as Lionel Spalding is funny. Rupert Everett as Lord Rutledge was very interesting That movie is funny, cute, and great you will like this movie so does Dunston the orangutan.

    This is the sort of light caper that is nothing special but does provide some harmless fun for kids who will undoubtedly get more of a kick out of an Orangutan's shenanigans than an adult will--although there are some very clever moments that fill the bill for young and old. JASON Alexander is expert as a hotel manager with two bratty kids who seem to have nothing better to do than make mischief as they cavort around the hotel with an unexpected guest. Seems that a jewel thief (RUPERT EVERETT) has checked in with his pet who's been trained to steal. This sets up the structure of the plot which has the kids and the Orangutan as the main focus of attention. It's fun to see FAYE DUNAWAY enjoying herself in a comic role and everyone else enters nicely into the spirit of the whole thing. Easy to take and passes the time quickly with a few very clever moments among the many vignettes involving some cute stunts.

    A manager and his two sons live in a hotel. The sons must not go to school at all because they are always causing trouble in the hotel. It really bothered me that they didn't go to school. Anyway, the youngest son finds this ape and the ape is part of a jewelery robbery. The movie was similar to "Monkey Trouble" in the sense of stealing apes or monkeys. It was a pretty cute movie but it was cheesy too. In some parts, I just wanted to fire the father and in other parts I just felt sorry for him. The poor guy couldn't even get a vacation and on top of that he had this kids who were just brats. It was a heartwarming family kind of movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Watch it with a banana split.

    1995 and 1996 were clearly the years for movies dealing with primates. "Ed "in 1996 taught us that heroes come in all shapes, and all sizes. Congo (1995) taught us that apes could be both intelligent and evil. Let's not forget 1995's "Born to be Wild", where a teenage boy and female gorilla's near bestiality captured all our hearts. However, not since the original "Planet of Apes" has a movie captivated our attention, and made us feel what it's like to be a monkey. "Dunston Checks In" set the bar for years to come. Sam the orangutan's performance as Dunston is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Blockbuster actors such as Ben Affleck and James Franco could learn a lesson or two from Sam. You think Ben Affleck was emotional when he said "I love you" to Bruce Willis in Armageddon? Think again. When Sam looks at the picture of him and his now dead brother, his expression alone brings a tear to ones eye. You think James Franco was in pain in Spider-Man 2 when he realized his best friend was the man who killed his father? Try watching Sam when he is getting a piece of glass torn from his flesh. Sam's connection with the audience is so great you almost feel the glass being ripped from your own hand. This is not to mention the other wonderful qualities this movie has. Amazing slapstick comedy, alcoholic older women, Jason Alexander cursing, Faye Dunaway's fall from grace, an orangutan spanking a prominent socialite, and a cameo from Paul Reubens that can only be explained with two words: Oscar worthy. The fact that this film did not win any Academy Awards is shocking. Five for sure: Paul Reubens beating out Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Woods for Best Supporting Actor, "Dunston Checks In" narrowly defeating "The English Patient" for Best Picture, Ken Kwapis for Best Director, Best Music Robert Blackwell, and lastly, a landslide victory for Sam, the orangutan for Best Actor. It is criminal that the Academy shafted this great film in 1996 with no Oscars and zero nominations. Although it was given no Oscars this much can be certain: it set the standard and paved the way for future primate movies. Where would MVP: Most Vaulable Primate and MXP: Most Xtreme Primate be without Dunston Checks In? In some Hollywood executive's trash, that's where. Because of pioneer movies like "Dunston Checks In" movies like MVP and MXP enjoy much commercial success. So grab your kids, round up the neighbor, pop some popcorn, and get ready to laugh, and cry at one of the best movies in the last twenty years: "Dunston Checks In".

    This was surprisingly entertaining and with a few minor exceptions, very inoffensive family fare. It's another one of those adults-and-kids can enjoy flicks with a number of lines that border on being too much for kids but are still tame for adults - close, but safe. There are also some funny special effects and some good slapstick humor. Being basically a kids' film, the main child, played by Eric Lloyd is cute but a little too spoiled for me but he's tolerable, as is his brother. Jason Alexander is the father, a very likable subdued guy but a little too lenient. The real surprise in this cast is Faye Dunaway. Usually playing hard-edged types, she is the opposite in here which is kind of refreshing to see. She shows a nice comedic touch. The chimpanzee is probably the most entertaining, which is the idea, but so is the villain played by Rupert Evert. In other words, there are a lot of likable characters in this movie. This a "sleeper:" an underrated film that a lot of people would enjoy. I'm sorry it never got much "press."

    A little boy who lives in a luxurious hotel (his father, Jason Alexander, owns it) has no friends and lives a miserable life until a monkey (or, to be more accurate, an orangutan) walks in one day and becomes his new best buddy. Cue lots of stupid physical humor, shots of surprised guests shocked at the prospect of seeing a monkey in a rich hotel, more shots of disgust from the struggling father (Alexander doing his George Costanza), and Faye Dunaway looking old. This is a really terrible movie for children. It says that if you don't have any friends, you should get a monkey and be really destructive and ruin your father's business - because rich people suck.
