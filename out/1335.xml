 <sinopse>
  Long-repressed feelings of bitterness and betrayal explode when three inner-city losers plot the robbery of a valuable coin in a seedy second-hand junk shop.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  AMERICAN BUFFALO is another story of men's interminable struggle toward the top of the heap, a goal which ultimately and inevitably eludes most of us. Don Dubro, the proprietor of a dusty dark inner-city junk shop, holds court there with his friends and makes plans probably on a daily basis for his ascendancy to the top. He does this more out of habit than hope because he's long ago surrendered his future to the daily repetition of his life as guardian of the discarded remnants of others' possessions. Disheveled Teach, on the other hand, is either too dumb or too stubborn to accept the lot life has dealt him. Instead, he bucks like a wild horse under the saddle and refuses to be broken. Most pitiable of the trio which populates the movie is teen-aged Bobby. Mistaking much of the palaver which passes between the older men as pearls of wisdom, Bobby is the only one of the trio who still has a chance to make a life for himself somewhere beyond this tired too-familiar neighborhood. Don ...

    Perhaps my expectations were needlessly high, given the pairing of Hoffman and Franz, and the fact that David Mamet penned the screenplay from his original Broadway play. But after forcing myself to watch the entire production, I had to go online to figure out if I had missed something crucial that might have some redeeming value. Unfortunately, what I found online only mirrored what I had experienced. This film has very to little to offer beyond non-stop dialog delivered at a machine gun pace, much of which is missed given the speed of its delivery. And there's no let up for the viewer, no moments to pause and reflect on the content. You can't afford to, lest you might miss the significant development that has to be in here somewhere, the one you keep wishing would finally appear. But the payoff never comes. But it finally just ends, mercifully, allowing to viewer to wonder why they just wasted their time watching this mind numbing display of a very meager plot augmented only by earthy dialog and very little else. Mamet fans might find some redeeming value here, but for the average viewer, there's very little there, there. Given a choice, sorting my sock drawer has more intellectual stimulation.

    After previewing this movie, I can't imagine why Dustin Hoffman allowed it to be distributed. If I were he, I would have paid to keep anyone from seeing it. This is the only movie I have ever walked out of before the end. I wouldn't mind a movie that has little action or special effects, but I do prefer one that has a script. My friend and I both love Hoffman and Franz, but the dialogue was not that good and the movie was going nowhere. After twenty or so minutes of incredibly boring conversation,we looked at each other, stood up, walked and never looked back. I have never regretted that decision; I only wish I had asked for a refund.

    A film starring Dustin Hoffman, plus the chief super from the Hill Street Blues, from an adapted script by screen writing legend David Mamet, at a pocket-money price? Why hadn't I heard of it, what was wrong with it. Nothing - except it's more a filmed play than a film, with almost all the talky dialogue taking place in a dusty old New York junk shop. Dustin Hoffman is superb, mixing a florid torrent of irrelevant comment, swearing and unease that is not a far cry from his brilliant turns in Rain Main and Midnight Cowboy. Dennis Franz, meanwhile is the shop's proprietor and is an almost opposite, a masterclass in understated body language as the rants from Teach (Hoffman) have become like water off a duck's back. A third character, black youth Sean Nelson is the dog's body of the outfit and has his own agendas to deal with. The U.S coin of the title is one that might be worth a lot of money, or is it? Having sold it for more than they thought it worth, do they steal it back, just in case it's worth thousands? Mamet's dialogue crackles with a crisp reality - Teach swears like a trooper, with F and C swear words jumbled up along with everything else. He's harmless, you conclude, if not obviously emotionally damaged. Donny, (Franz) says as much and as little as most shopkeepers say; only when it's needed to get a deal done; to clarify a point. It undoubtedly would have had more impact and urgency within the confines of a set in an actual theatre, but on DVD it's OK. The shop, at least looks like a proper shop with a plethora of junk, the clutter adding to the feeling of messed up lives, somehow. Sadly, this won't appeal to everyone. There's no real action to speak of, no pretty women to break up the squalid male-ness and like Teach's dialogue, the story goes round in circles. However, this tale of emerging bitterness and feelings of underachievement is palpable and engaging, if you let it. Personally, I'm glad I chanced upon it.

    I love films like this. Limited, resourceful, and yet makes mountains out of molehills. I also love David Mamet and I could listen to his expert dialouge for hours on end. So how could I not love this film? Sure if you dissect it, it has some issues, but I can't help but love everything it does. The movie only has three characters. Dustin Hoffman is Teach, a bitter and cynical man whose friend is Don, played by Dennis Franz. Don owns a junk shop and also looks out for Bob, a street kid with a lot of issues. When Teach and Don learn that they might have been jipped out of some very valuable coins they decide they're going to go steal the coins back. The plan reveals the dark inner turmoil the three characters feel and it is ultimately their quest to find meaning and purpose in a world that has hung them out to dry. It's a story of futile human desperation delivered through snappy and quick witted dialouge that I found fascinating. It's imperative to mention that this film is only dialouge. There is no action, no special effects, and not even a change in scenery. I might be crazy for saying this, but I loved it. It was an extremely interesting watch to see what could be accomplished on an existential level with so little tangible material. The film was originally a stage play written by David Mamet that he adapted into a screenplay with little to no changes in his near perfect dialouge. Because of the little change in location and the unusually small cast of three I get the feeling the film works better as a stage play, but having never seen the stage version, the movie was a great watch unto itself. Everything is kept very simple and all of the focus was on the actors and the dialouge they delivered making the movie very unconventional, so much to the point where it doesn't really feel like a movie. But this uniqueness is what I enjoyed so much about the film, just out of personal love for the strange and different. Now I will admit that if the film had not had good actors to back up Mamet's sharp edged dialouge, American Buffalo would have been an awful, dreary, and pathetically boring film. But the three main, and only, actors in the film keep it lively and interesting from start to finish. Hoffman and Franz work together as a perfect duo and their contrast in characteristic give the film a lot of its deep perplexity on the human condition. Nelson isn't in the movie as much as Hoffman and Franz, but when he is present he does a great job, and his character is very important to the progression of the story. The actors do a lot of justice to the ingenious dialouge of this film. There isn't much more to say about American Buffalo. There isn't a whole lot to the film, but what elements it does possess are fantastic. The dialouge and acting is brilliant, and there isn't much more to the movie. I honestly loved how different of a movie experience this was, and can give the movie nothing but props for making me think and delivering to me such a unique experience.

    I have seen "American Buffalo" in Romanian, during a theater festival this summer. It was amazing, the two hours seemed like 20 minutes. I personally don't like when plays try to be catchy through swearing, but this one took my breath away. The anxiety was crazy, even though I knew there were only three actors playing I still expected another character to appear. I believe this is a masterpiece, but not for anyone. You have to understand the typologies created in order to enjoy them truly. I agree that it is better played on stage rather than in a movie. However, even in the hall me and my friends seemed to be the only one enjoying it. Nobody else was laughing, many thought of it to be boring and very obscene. That was when I realized that not everybody knows how to see the greatness in the really incredible things. So kudos to whoever knew how to enjoy this movie/play! To the others: is your loss! 10 out of 10!

    Yes, it feels like a play: centred on conversation- and what lively conversation- between just three people: little action. I don't think that disqualifies it from being a great film.Does a movie have to be all action? I was reminded of Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (waiting for Fletcher). I watch TV late watching and normally fall asleep during the most vigorous movies. This film kept me sitting on the edge of my seat all the way through. If you enjoy people and seeing how somewhat depraved characters- even extraordinary characters like Teach- have some goodness deep down this movie will have meaning for you. The acting is first class

    I've never seen this play performed except for that time in college when I directed a scene from it. I deliberately avoided this movie at the time so as not to color my direction any particular way. The way I see the play is a couple of old guys sitting around a resale shop talking about stealing a guy's coin collection, sort of fooling themselves into thinking they're even capable of such a thing. My ideal cast would be (undead) Lemmon and Matthau, but it could also work with some very young people who don't know better. The point is, the crime is that distant idea which is captivating, but an impossibility. It's like folks who dream about winning the lottery and imagine what they'd do with those vast riches, but know inside that it'll never happen. This movie's mistake, in my eyes as a one-time director, is that it almost makes the crime plausible. Don, owner of the shop, and Teach, his talkative buddy, go through the plan of what to do when they get to the guy's house. How do they get inside? Go through a window the guy left open. What if there's no window? There's always something - kick in the door if you have to. Okay, where does the guy keep his coins? In his desk drawer. How do you know? C'mon, they have to be in there. If he's got a safe? Find the combination written down somewhere in the house. What if he didn't write it down? Everybody writes it down! How do we even know he's not home right now? They call the number and are shocked when someone actually answers. But they dialed the wrong number anyway. The long discussions these two have about the plan is a lot like some little kids having a play war in the backyard. No detail of the fantasy is too small and if things don't work out, you can always whip out an imaginary sword and gut your enemy, just like Teach plans to somehow find a safe combination hidden somewhere in a whole house. This play always worked better as a sad little comedy to me. The movie's director, one Mr. Michael Corrente, has turned it into a real caper movie! That's too easy a choice to make, too on the nose, and it doesn't allow the audience to see the irony of these washed up crooks trying desperately to convince themselves that they've still got what it takes. I never saw these guys as taking the whole thing too seriously as an actual thing that they were going to do. I just see Lemmon and Matthau trying to entertain themselves with the notion that they're going to commit a crime together, like the old days. Maybe Teach thinks it's a real thing, but not Don. Don is just the one who plays along with Teach's wild fantasies. Not in this movie. Here Don is every bit as committed to the theft as Teach, and just as devastated when it looks impossible. I didn't laugh as much at this movie as I did at the play in my mind. This thing is just depressing. http://www.movieswithmark.com

    "American Buffalo" is definitely not a movie for everyone. A downer in every sense, it portrays three pitiful characters with nowhere to go in life. I guess that overall, there's little to be said about the movie. It's little more than a way to pass time. The whole thing has the distinct feel of a play (it all happens pretty much in one room), but Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Franz and Sean Nelson have little to do here. Still, it might make you ponder your own direction in life. I have to wonder about that coin featuring the buffalo. When you think about it, that coin went the way of the buffalo. Maybe I'm the only person who notices that.

    I'm more than surprised that this is a much ignored movie in the internet, underrated maybe?... I finished seeing it and I was mixed with emotions, with possibilities that could have started at any time in the movie so I watched it again right there. Marvelous dialogs, I think this is a Mamet and Hoffman thing. But I couldn't find more feedback on the internet about the plot and the outcomes. But be careful because I read some comments that were too much sure about it. I believe this is what David Mamet's genius is about. And people with a lot of talent putting it in front of you.

    I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set. It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally so. It's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie. The one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside at the banal personalities, they're acted quite reasonably. But you have to brace yourself for endless dialog, wishing on many an occasion that Teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.

Don is just the one who plays along with Teach's wild fantasies. Not in this movie. Here Don is every bit as committed to the theft as Teach, and just as devastated when it looks impossible. I didn't laugh as much at this movie as I did at the play in my mind. This thing is just depressing. http://www.movieswithmark.com

    "American Buffalo" is definitely not a movie for everyone. A downer in every sense, it portrays three pitiful characters with nowhere to go in life. I guess that overall, there's little to be said about the movie. It's little more than a way to pass time. The whole thing has the distinct feel of a play (it all happens pretty much in one room), but Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Franz and Sean Nelson have little to do here. Still, it might make you ponder your own direction in life. I have to wonder about that coin featuring the buffalo. When you think about it, that coin went the way of the buffalo. Maybe I'm the only person who notices that.

    I'm more than surprised that this is a much ignored movie in the internet, underrated maybe?... I finished seeing it and I was mixed with emotions, with possibilities that could have started at any time in the movie so I watched it again right there. Marvelous dialogs, I think this is a Mamet and Hoffman thing. But I couldn't find more feedback on the internet about the plot and the outcomes. But be careful because I read some comments that were too much sure about it. I believe this is what David Mamet's genius is about. And people with a lot of talent putting it in front of you.

    I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set. It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally so. It's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie. The one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside at the banal personalities, they're acted quite reasonably. But you have to brace yourself for endless dialog, wishing on many an occasion that Teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.

    Perhaps my expectations were needlessly high, given the pairing of Hoffman and Franz, and the fact that David Mamet penned the screenplay from his original Broadway play. But after forcing myself to watch the entire production, I had to go online to figure out if I had missed something crucial that might have some redeeming value. Unfortunately, what I found online only mirrored what I had experienced. This film has very to little to offer beyond non-stop dialog delivered at a machine gun pace, much of which is missed given the speed of its delivery. And there's no let up for the viewer, no moments to pause and reflect on the content. You can't afford to, lest you might miss the significant development that has to be in here somewhere, the one you keep wishing would finally appear. But the payoff never comes. But it finally just ends, mercifully, allowing to viewer to wonder why they just wasted their time watching this mind numbing display of a very meager plot augmented only by earthy dialog and very little else. Mamet fans might find some redeeming value here, but for the average viewer, there's very little there, there. Given a choice, sorting my sock drawer has more intellectual stimulation.

    After previewing this movie, I can't imagine why Dustin Hoffman allowed it to be distributed. If I were he, I would have paid to keep anyone from seeing it. This is the only movie I have ever walked out of before the end. I wouldn't mind a movie that has little action or special effects, but I do prefer one that has a script. My friend and I both love Hoffman and Franz, but the dialogue was not that good and the movie was going nowhere. After twenty or so minutes of incredibly boring conversation,we looked at each other, stood up, walked and never looked back. I have never regretted that decision; I only wish I had asked for a refund.

    A film starring Dustin Hoffman, plus the chief super from the Hill Street Blues, from an adapted script by screen writing legend David Mamet, at a pocket-money price? Why hadn't I heard of it, what was wrong with it. Nothing - except it's more a filmed play than a film, with almost all the talky dialogue taking place in a dusty old New York junk shop. Dustin Hoffman is superb, mixing a florid torrent of irrelevant comment, swearing and unease that is not a far cry from his brilliant turns in Rain Main and Midnight Cowboy. Dennis Franz, meanwhile is the shop's proprietor and is an almost opposite, a masterclass in understated body language as the rants from Teach (Hoffman) have become like water off a duck's back. A third character, black youth Sean Nelson is the dog's body of the outfit and has his own agendas to deal with. The U.S coin of the title is one that might be worth a lot of money, or is it? Having sold it for more than they thought it worth, do they steal it back, just in case it's worth thousands? Mamet's dialogue crackles with a crisp reality - Teach swears like a trooper, with F and C swear words jumbled up along with everything else. He's harmless, you conclude, if not obviously emotionally damaged. Donny, (Franz) says as much and as little as most shopkeepers say; only when it's needed to get a deal done; to clarify a point. It undoubtedly would have had more impact and urgency within the confines of a set in an actual theatre, but on DVD it's OK. The shop, at least looks like a proper shop with a plethora of junk, the clutter adding to the feeling of messed up lives, somehow. Sadly, this won't appeal to everyone. There's no real action to speak of, no pretty women to break up the squalid male-ness and like Teach's dialogue, the story goes round in circles. However, this tale of emerging bitterness and feelings of underachievement is palpable and engaging, if you let it. Personally, I'm glad I chanced upon it.

    I love films like this. Limited, resourceful, and yet makes mountains out of molehills. I also love David Mamet and I could listen to his expert dialouge for hours on end. So how could I not love this film? Sure if you dissect it, it has some issues, but I can't help but love everything it does. The movie only has three characters. Dustin Hoffman is Teach, a bitter and cynical man whose friend is Don, played by Dennis Franz. Don owns a junk shop and also looks out for Bob, a street kid with a lot of issues. When Teach and Don learn that they might have been jipped out of some very valuable coins they decide they're going to go steal the coins back. The plan reveals the dark inner turmoil the three characters feel and it is ultimately their quest to find meaning and purpose in a world that has hung them out to dry. It's a story of futile human desperation delivered through snappy and quick witted dialouge that I found fascinating. It's imperative to mention that this film is only dialouge. There is no action, no special effects, and not even a change in scenery. I might be crazy for saying this, but I loved it. It was an extremely interesting watch to see what could be accomplished on an existential level with so little tangible material. The film was originally a stage play written by David Mamet that he adapted into a screenplay with little to no changes in his near perfect dialouge. Because of the little change in location and the unusually small cast of three I get the feeling the film works better as a stage play, but having never seen the stage version, the movie was a great watch unto itself. Everything is kept very simple and all of the focus was on the actors and the dialouge they delivered making the movie very unconventional, so much to the point where it doesn't really feel like a movie. But this uniqueness is what I enjoyed so much about the film, just out of personal love for the strange and different. Now I will admit that if the film had not had good actors to back up Mamet's sharp edged dialouge, American Buffalo would have been an awful, dreary, and pathetically boring film. But the three main, and only, actors in the film keep it lively and interesting from start to finish. Hoffman and Franz work together as a perfect duo and their contrast in characteristic give the film a lot of its deep perplexity on the human condition. Nelson isn't in the movie as much as Hoffman and Franz, but when he is present he does a great job, and his character is very important to the progression of the story. The actors do a lot of justice to the ingenious dialouge of this film. There isn't much more to say about American Buffalo. There isn't a whole lot to the film, but what elements it does possess are fantastic. The dialouge and acting is brilliant, and there isn't much more to the movie. I honestly loved how different of a movie experience this was, and can give the movie nothing but props for making me think and delivering to me such a unique experience.

    I have seen "American Buffalo" in Romanian, during a theater festival this summer. It was amazing, the two hours seemed like 20 minutes. I personally don't like when plays try to be catchy through swearing, but this one took my breath away. The anxiety was crazy, even though I knew there were only three actors playing I still expected another character to appear. I believe this is a masterpiece, but not for anyone. You have to understand the typologies created in order to enjoy them truly. I agree that it is better played on stage rather than in a movie. However, even in the hall me and my friends seemed to be the only one enjoying it. Nobody else was laughing, many thought of it to be boring and very obscene. That was when I realized that not everybody knows how to see the greatness in the really incredible things. So kudos to whoever knew how to enjoy this movie/play! To the others: is your loss! 10 out of 10!

    Yes, it feels like a play: centred on conversation- and what lively conversation- between just three people: little action. I don't think that disqualifies it from being a great film.Does a movie have to be all action? I was reminded of Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (waiting for Fletcher). I watch TV late watching and normally fall asleep during the most vigorous movies. This film kept me sitting on the edge of my seat all the way through. If you enjoy people and seeing how somewhat depraved characters- even extraordinary characters like Teach- have some goodness deep down this movie will have meaning for you. The acting is first class

    I've never seen this play performed except for that time in college when I directed a scene from it. I deliberately avoided this movie at the time so as not to color my direction any particular way. The way I see the play is a couple of old guys sitting around a resale shop talking about stealing a guy's coin collection, sort of fooling themselves into thinking they're even capable of such a thing. My ideal cast would be (undead) Lemmon and Matthau, but it could also work with some very young people who don't know better. The point is, the crime is that distant idea which is captivating, but an impossibility. It's like folks who dream about winning the lottery and imagine what they'd do with those vast riches, but know inside that it'll never happen. This movie's mistake, in my eyes as a one-time director, is that it almost makes the crime plausible. Don, owner of the shop, and Teach, his talkative buddy, go through the plan of what to do when they get to the guy's house. How do they get inside? Go through a window the guy left open. What if there's no window? There's always something - kick in the door if you have to. Okay, where does the guy keep his coins? In his desk drawer. How do you know? C'mon, they have to be in there. If he's got a safe? Find the combination written down somewhere in the house. What if he didn't write it down? Everybody writes it down! How do we even know he's not home right now? They call the number and are shocked when someone actually answers. But they dialed the wrong number anyway. The long discussions these two have about the plan is a lot like some little kids having a play war in the backyard. No detail of the fantasy is too small and if things don't work out, you can always whip out an imaginary sword and gut your enemy, just like Teach plans to somehow find a safe combination hidden somewhere in a whole house. This play always worked better as a sad little comedy to me. The movie's director, one Mr. Michael Corrente, has turned it into a real caper movie! That's too easy a choice to make, too on the nose, and it doesn't allow the audience to see the irony of these washed up crooks trying desperately to convince themselves that they've still got what it takes. I never saw these guys as taking the whole thing too seriously as an actual thing that they were going to do. I just see Lemmon and Matthau trying to entertain themselves with the notion that they're going to commit a crime together, like the old days. Maybe Teach thinks it's a real thing, but not Don. Don is just the one who plays along with Teach's wild fantasies. Not in this movie. Here Don is every bit as committed to the theft as Teach, and just as devastated when it looks impossible.

If he's got a safe? Find the combination written down somewhere in the house. What if he didn't write it down? Everybody writes it down! How do we even know he's not home right now? They call the number and are shocked when someone actually answers. But they dialed the wrong number anyway. The long discussions these two have about the plan is a lot like some little kids having a play war in the backyard. No detail of the fantasy is too small and if things don't work out, you can always whip out an imaginary sword and gut your enemy, just like Teach plans to somehow find a safe combination hidden somewhere in a whole house. This play always worked better as a sad little comedy to me. The movie's director, one Mr. Michael Corrente, has turned it into a real caper movie! That's too easy a choice to make, too on the nose, and it doesn't allow the audience to see the irony of these washed up crooks trying desperately to convince themselves that they've still got what it takes. I never saw these guys as taking the whole thing too seriously as an actual thing that they were going to do. I just see Lemmon and Matthau trying to entertain themselves with the notion that they're going to commit a crime together, like the old days. Maybe Teach thinks it's a real thing, but not Don. Don is just the one who plays along with Teach's wild fantasies. Not in this movie. Here Don is every bit as committed to the theft as Teach, and just as devastated when it looks impossible. I didn't laugh as much at this movie as I did at the play in my mind. This thing is just depressing. http://www.movieswithmark.com

    "American Buffalo" is definitely not a movie for everyone. A downer in every sense, it portrays three pitiful characters with nowhere to go in life. I guess that overall, there's little to be said about the movie. It's little more than a way to pass time. The whole thing has the distinct feel of a play (it all happens pretty much in one room), but Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Franz and Sean Nelson have little to do here. Still, it might make you ponder your own direction in life. I have to wonder about that coin featuring the buffalo. When you think about it, that coin went the way of the buffalo. Maybe I'm the only person who notices that.

    I'm more than surprised that this is a much ignored movie in the internet, underrated maybe?... I finished seeing it and I was mixed with emotions, with possibilities that could have started at any time in the movie so I watched it again right there. Marvelous dialogs, I think this is a Mamet and Hoffman thing. But I couldn't find more feedback on the internet about the plot and the outcomes. But be careful because I read some comments that were too much sure about it. I believe this is what David Mamet's genius is about. And people with a lot of talent putting it in front of you.

    I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set. It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally so. It's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie. The one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside at the banal personalities, they're acted quite reasonably. But you have to brace yourself for endless dialog, wishing on many an occasion that Teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.
