    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    What? What did I see? Hear what? Nothing!? Home tightened. Unclear. And this for a half hour. Watch! We have to finish. Next, from the middle all begins. Action begins. Frenzy. Through so much action and all tied to a single topic. Love ... Final - the divine symphony. Symphony of the senses. Symphony of love! Oh love! Love ... What else is more beautiful in life? About feelings... Love - forever. A film worth seeing!

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was.

That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy.

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    I remember the day day when i picked this movie from a friend of mine. When I got home I just saw a little of it like a preview.At that time I didn't liked it much. One day I got to watch the full movie (as I have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch). When I finished with the movie, I regretted to myself Why I didn't watch this movie on the day i brought it..? Most of my friends didn't like it. They told me this movie is really slow and boring. But rather find it very interesting. While I was watching the movie I was all curious. At the beginning it was about what's gonna happen between Mr. Almasy and Mrs. Cliffton and then how their story gonna be end. I always have an interest for the classic stories and philosophical stories and also in love stories. I read the books, all of the above types. I like them. So when it comes to movie it felt like I am not reading a book, rather I am watching a live book. So i love these movies. It's the same reason I love this one. The way the story has turned in the movie is good. I just felt sorry for my friends who mocked at me for watching it,cause they lost a good movie to watch. I am pretty sure that that those who hate it, there is only two reasons for their hatred. One is their taste of movie is not the one that include the base of movies like this one or they have bad taste. Second one is they don't understand such type of movies so they don't watch it.

    I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance. There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'. I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996). The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more. Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you. I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.

    It took me a while to decide to write this because I didn't know how to start it. Well I when I first saw this movie a gave it an 8 because of the slow peace and length but days after watching it and I knew how this stayed in my mind I decided to give it a perfect 10. The two most important things for me in a good romance it's a great story, great chemistry between the main couple and great performances this film definitely has all of those ingredients. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is out of this world you just want to see them together even though we know they way they started their relationship was wrong since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes does a great job playing Almasi a man who first doesn't want be owned like says but latter becomes obsessed with Katherine and ends up doing everything to be with her and of course we can't deny how gorgeous and sexy he is. Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job portraying Katherine who feels guilty for cheating on her husband but still can't do anything with her feelings for Almasi. The supporting cast which has Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe and Colin Firth was also great. The story keeps us interested from the beginning till the end even tough it's slow peace.

    This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fianc&eacute; in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

    Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey. Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was. Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, "the Father of History". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep. That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions. Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in "Lawrence of Arabia" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.

    What? What did I see? Hear what? Nothing!? Home tightened. Unclear. And this for a half hour. Watch! We have to finish. Next, from the middle all begins. Action begins. Frenzy. Through so much action and all tied to a single topic. Love ... Final - the divine symphony. Symphony of the senses. Symphony of love! Oh love! Love ... What else is more beautiful in life? About feelings... Love - forever. A film worth seeing!

    "The English Patient" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways. ------------- Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the "side show" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people. "The English Patient" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengeance for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain). Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you! Well........about 80% of "The English Patient" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame. However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012). I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that "every cloud has a silver lining" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like "The English Patient" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show "counterpoint" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie. Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the "good life" from England. All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples. The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it. Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England. Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many. This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials. "The English Patient" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people). The good times are over, but "The English Patient" (1998) provides an important "homage" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world. Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor. Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen

    Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; de Alm&aacute;sy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the "hero" deliberately sells out the British  the West  to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.

    Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.

    First off:I loved this movie. I am a straight/African/N.Korean male with combat military experience. In my opinion...anyone who dose not at least like this movie for it's cleverness, multilayered characters, and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation.(Battleship POtemken) Peoples, It tells the story of real life people in love during WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman, the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help. Possible training in bayonet thrusting and dodging. I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library. The extra value in purchasing this edition over the vanilla release can be summed up like this: DTS & Minghella. The DTS track makes a dramatic improvement upon the quality of the film. The big sound effects and Gabriel Yared score are exploited 100 times better than Dolby 5.1, and to me that makes it a much more enjoyable experience to sit through. Then there's Anthony Minghella. I sat there listening to him talk on the commentaries and in interviews, and I thought "I wish I was half as eloquent and sincere as him". He managed to explain his vision of the film in a way that seemed totally true and organic, and which made a subsequent viewing of the film a lot easier to grasp. The special edition DVD is a revelation. There are features looking at the making of the film, The Work of Stuart Craig looking at how he designed the film (excellent by the way) and a couple of deleted scenes among others. A truly exceptional package to compliment an already tremendous film. One of my favourite anti-peace DVDs.
