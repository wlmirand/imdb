 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Set in the 1950s, Rough Magic tells the story of what happens when a pretty apprentice magician goes to Mexico to escape her fianc&eacute;, a wealthy politician, and to find a Mayan shaman who will teach her ancient principles of magic. She is being trailed by a detective hired by her fianc&eacute;. He's a former photojournalist traumatized by what he saw in Hiroshima. The photojournalist joins her in the search for the Mayan shaman, and falls in love with her; the feeling is not reciprocated. When she finds the shaman, she drinks a potion which empowers her to do magic. The potion has life-changing effects on her and her relationship with her companion. They have strange experiences which are brought about by magic.

    When I accidentally caught this on HBO many years ago, I wasn't paying very close attention at first; but as the movie continued, I became increasingly intrigued by its quirkiness. Based on the 1944 book 'Miss Shumway Waves a Wand', the story takes place in L.A. and Mexico, and follows magician Myra Shumway (played by Bridget Fonda) as she escapes from her sleazy, wealthy fianc&eacute; and falls in love with detective Alex Ross (played by a young Russell Crowe). Things become more surreal as elements of film noir begin to mix with magic realism. Much of the focus is on what Myra describes as "that terribly empty space between my heart and my head"  that is, the balance between the power of intuition and emotion on one side and calculating rationality on the other. Practical thinking alone, we learn, leads nowhere good. Love, on the other hand, is a liberating force. Unfortunately, in an effort to invoke 'magic' in the film, the word is repeated too many times with an irritating lack of subtlety, especially by a snake-oil salesman played by Jim Broadbent. And that's the film's main weakness: too often it spells out its intentions and gives away its tricks. This said, I was still charmed by director Clare Peploe's daring playfulness. While the film isn't perfect, it has a lot of heart and feels a bit like a strange dream at times. The story takes some wild, unexpected turns and I was entertained throughout, even upon a second viewing. I couldn't disagree more with those who suggest Bridget Fonda isn't right for the role. I think she's fantastic! I find her quite believable and sexy as Miss Shumway. Russell Crowe is appropriately suave and Mexican American comedian Paul Rodriguez occasionally steals the show. 'Rough Magic' is not a work of art that takes itself too seriously. Its kind of fantasy feels both mainstream and eccentric in a way that reminds me of HBO's Tales From The Crypt, only it's in no way macabre. Check it out on a lazy evening, perhaps with the company of some magic potion.

    I recently had to watch this movie for a study at UCSB, and, really, with the opening few scenes, I was not exactly thrilled. However, I did find myself feeling like I was actually in the movie at quite a few points, definitely immersed, experiencing a sort of flow, and had elicited in me quite a noticeable emotional response. Truly, I have found that anything with R. Crowe in it is usually frigging awesome, and I had never before experienced a movie with B. Fonda, who in this movie is irresistibly cute! I found out after the study that I was in the "female/romance" category, and was subjected to two more movies which were no more than mere trash. This movie, albeit old, was for me enthralling in the category of Romancing the Stone, though more realistic in some ways, and far more fake in others. I definitely recommend this movie if you've got netflix or the like, it's a good movie to zone out to, but I'll tell you what, I had the urge more than once to have a smoke. I guess that's what one would expect from a movie set in the 50's. Enjoy!

    Usually, it might seem out of place to make 1950s LA the setting for something involving magical realism, but they pull it off here, with Bridget Fonda as an amateur magician going to Mexico to further her studies with a Mayan shaman. While the story mostly focuses on her trip down there, and how a detective (Russell Crowe) follows her, my favorite parts were the scenes with the Mexican guy, and what he does towards the end. When people in Latin America first started telling stories centering on magical realism, they probably never envisioned that! Anyway, "Rough Magic" isn't a great movie, but a good look at a part of Latin American culture that many people in the US unfortunately don't know about. Worth seeing. PS: This movie will probably give you a new view of rabbits.

    "Rough Magic" is a little undiscovered gem. I came across it going through Russell Crowe's output and fell in love with it immediately. It was lighthearted, magical, elegant, whimsical, humorous, gently satirical, self mocking, yet meaningful all at once. But most of all it seemed to speak of something important in such an elusive way as to be completely incomprehensible. This is a hallmark of all mystical teachings; they seem to relate most mundane stories yet they keep calling you back for another look. It happens because the nagging feeling that you are missing something essential and of great importance doesn't leave you alone. Over the years I have watched "Rough Magic" enough times for it to loose its freshness, but that has not happened somehow. Each time i see it i am delighted anew by the vivid locale, its true to the period costumes and sets, its music that is just right at every turn, its good looking international cast that carries the movie's invisible agenda perfectly.

    Dear, oh dear. Oh dear. Even the ten lines of text that are required for these reviews is more than this film deserves. Watching Rough Magic is like watching a whole heap of (not necessarily high quality, either) films from genres of magical-realism, 1920's/30's adventure, fantasy, atomic-power-angst, comedy, romance, coming-of-age and film noir all at the same time. On little sleep. The resulting after-images in your mind would be a big jumbled, confusing, possibly brilliant somewhere, badly told mess. Or you can just watch this film and get the same effect. I think the last scenes in particular are added just to show the audience that, 'yes we made a bad film but at least you weren't expecting *this*'. And after watching this I couldn't shake the feeling that there was the potential for a brilliant film from all the badly fitting pieces. It will keep you guessing, at least, right up until the end. But only because you might be expecting a coherent story.

    And giving it a two was a real struggle. Almost magical on my part. This is the sort of lamebrain thing that has brought on Hollywood vomiting all over its own shoes. Or rather that has always had the place doing it to itself. It just loves mindlessness. Though in this case it has outdone itself. You had the feeling it felt restrained from being so earthbound. Needing a flying camera from 30000 feet through clouds. With an occasional reverse point of view underwater. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of film and Jack fell down and broke his splicer and Jill came tumbling after it and went home with her for a long tall dry martini. About the only thing I have seen this bad recently was Spielbergs The Terminal. Avoid both like the Bird Flu.

    ***MILD SPOILERS*** Warning: this movie needs to be picked up with a pair of tongs and held downwind. It is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen---when it was over I looked at the box again because I thought it might actually be an Allen Smithee feature. (I have friends who caution me that I won't really know what bad is until I see "The Lonely Lady" starring Pia Zadora...but until then I will hold firm that this holds the title.) It goes from being a quirky crime noir, to a romantic comedy, to trying to capture the magic realism of Latin films to For-God's-Sake Isn't-This-Gawdawful-Thing-Over-Yet? Now, there is nothing wrong with a movie that has romance and adventure along with truly bizarre scenes --IF it fits in with the entire style of the movie from start to finish. ("Like Water For Chocolate," is a good example.) Just because Paul Rodriguez is brought in to dance around with a sausage doesn't make it any less American and bland. Everything about this movie feels manufactured and artificial. Plus, it has a scene that I can't imagine would make any Hollywood starlet say, "Oh, I have to do this role..." I hope this won't be considered too much of a SPOILER but...she lays an egg! Russell Crowe is strangely wimpy looking in this film and Bridget Fonda's expressions range from vaguely put-out to slightly irritable. You never see much emotion on her face...even when rather troubling things are happening to her. Now, I'm not a director, but I think I would have given Ol' Bridge a little tip: when an egg comes out of your ass, at least look startled. There's another riveting scene when she barfs up her heart. And then she can't love anymore. Get it? You can almost feel the invisible elbow in the ribs from the writers, "See? Isn't that quirky? ISn't that just so damn QUIRKY?" "Rough Magic" is a boring film that tries to incorporate a bunch of different styles to mask the pedestrian script and lackluster acting. Having Bridget Fonda looking bemusedly at the egg she just laid will not make this movie endearingly quirky. It may make you laugh so hard soda comes out of your nose, however. If in ten years this movie is playing in theaters at midnight and people are showing up in Magician Assistant outfits and flinging eggs and hearts at the screen, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

    "Rough Magic" is a funny, sophisticated piece of fluff about losing and finding one's heart. Russell Crowe looks young and sweet. The Mexican Spanish spoken is entertaining, and Peploe's use of Mayan Indians and a kind of eclectic shamanism mixed with magic rings emotionally true. I loved this film and you will, too, if you are not too hung up on logic.

However, I did find myself feeling like I was actually in the movie at quite a few points, definitely immersed, experiencing a sort of flow, and had elicited in me quite a noticeable emotional response. Truly, I have found that anything with R. Crowe in it is usually frigging awesome, and I had never before experienced a movie with B. Fonda, who in this movie is irresistibly cute! I found out after the study that I was in the "female/romance" category, and was subjected to two more movies which were no more than mere trash. This movie, albeit old, was for me enthralling in the category of Romancing the Stone, though more realistic in some ways, and far more fake in others. I definitely recommend this movie if you've got netflix or the like, it's a good movie to zone out to, but I'll tell you what, I had the urge more than once to have a smoke. I guess that's what one would expect from a movie set in the 50's. Enjoy!

    Usually, it might seem out of place to make 1950s LA the setting for something involving magical realism, but they pull it off here, with Bridget Fonda as an amateur magician going to Mexico to further her studies with a Mayan shaman. While the story mostly focuses on her trip down there, and how a detective (Russell Crowe) follows her, my favorite parts were the scenes with the Mexican guy, and what he does towards the end. When people in Latin America first started telling stories centering on magical realism, they probably never envisioned that! Anyway, "Rough Magic" isn't a great movie, but a good look at a part of Latin American culture that many people in the US unfortunately don't know about. Worth seeing. PS: This movie will probably give you a new view of rabbits.

    A little undiscovered gem. Polished, faceted and ready to adorn a "favorite" list of those who like to see beyond a pretty face.

    "Rough Magic" is a little undiscovered gem. I came across it going through Russell Crowe's output and fell in love with it immediately. It was lighthearted, magical, elegant, whimsical, humorous, gently satirical, self mocking, yet meaningful all at once. But most of all it seemed to speak of something important in such an elusive way as to be completely incomprehensible. This is a hallmark of all mystical teachings; they seem to relate most mundane stories yet they keep calling you back for another look. It happens because the nagging feeling that you are missing something essential and of great importance doesn't leave you alone. Over the years I have watched "Rough Magic" enough times for it to loose its freshness, but that has not happened somehow. Each time i see it i am delighted anew by the vivid locale, its true to the period costumes and sets, its music that is just right at every turn, its good looking international cast that carries the movie's invisible agenda perfectly.

    Dear, oh dear. Oh dear. Even the ten lines of text that are required for these reviews is more than this film deserves. Watching Rough Magic is like watching a whole heap of (not necessarily high quality, either) films from genres of magical-realism, 1920's/30's adventure, fantasy, atomic-power-angst, comedy, romance, coming-of-age and film noir all at the same time. On little sleep. The resulting after-images in your mind would be a big jumbled, confusing, possibly brilliant somewhere, badly told mess. Or you can just watch this film and get the same effect. I think the last scenes in particular are added just to show the audience that, 'yes we made a bad film but at least you weren't expecting *this*'. And after watching this I couldn't shake the feeling that there was the potential for a brilliant film from all the badly fitting pieces. It will keep you guessing, at least, right up until the end. But only because you might be expecting a coherent story.

    And giving it a two was a real struggle. Almost magical on my part. This is the sort of lamebrain thing that has brought on Hollywood vomiting all over its own shoes. Or rather that has always had the place doing it to itself. It just loves mindlessness. Though in this case it has outdone itself. You had the feeling it felt restrained from being so earthbound. Needing a flying camera from 30000 feet through clouds. With an occasional reverse point of view underwater. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of film and Jack fell down and broke his splicer and Jill came tumbling after it and went home with her for a long tall dry martini. About the only thing I have seen this bad recently was Spielbergs The Terminal. Avoid both like the Bird Flu.

    Russell Crowe is young and shows as much talent as in every one of his movie ! Bridget Fonda is as beautiful as ever ! The love story between them is very appealing and the touch of magic makes you smile ... The kiss in the air between Russell and Bridget is pure magic !

    ***MILD SPOILERS*** Warning: this movie needs to be picked up with a pair of tongs and held downwind. It is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen---when it was over I looked at the box again because I thought it might actually be an Allen Smithee feature. (I have friends who caution me that I won't really know what bad is until I see "The Lonely Lady" starring Pia Zadora...but until then I will hold firm that this holds the title.) It goes from being a quirky crime noir, to a romantic comedy, to trying to capture the magic realism of Latin films to For-God's-Sake Isn't-This-Gawdawful-Thing-Over-Yet? Now, there is nothing wrong with a movie that has romance and adventure along with truly bizarre scenes --IF it fits in with the entire style of the movie from start to finish. ("Like Water For Chocolate," is a good example.) Just because Paul Rodriguez is brought in to dance around with a sausage doesn't make it any less American and bland. Everything about this movie feels manufactured and artificial. Plus, it has a scene that I can't imagine would make any Hollywood starlet say, "Oh, I have to do this role..." I hope this won't be considered too much of a SPOILER but...she lays an egg! Russell Crowe is strangely wimpy looking in this film and Bridget Fonda's expressions range from vaguely put-out to slightly irritable. You never see much emotion on her face...even when rather troubling things are happening to her. Now, I'm not a director, but I think I would have given Ol' Bridge a little tip: when an egg comes out of your ass, at least look startled. There's another riveting scene when she barfs up her heart. And then she can't love anymore. Get it? You can almost feel the invisible elbow in the ribs from the writers, "See? Isn't that quirky? ISn't that just so damn QUIRKY?" "Rough Magic" is a boring film that tries to incorporate a bunch of different styles to mask the pedestrian script and lackluster acting. Having Bridget Fonda looking bemusedly at the egg she just laid will not make this movie endearingly quirky. It may make you laugh so hard soda comes out of your nose, however. If in ten years this movie is playing in theaters at midnight and people are showing up in Magician Assistant outfits and flinging eggs and hearts at the screen, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

    "Rough Magic" is a funny, sophisticated piece of fluff about losing and finding one's heart. Russell Crowe looks young and sweet. The Mexican Spanish spoken is entertaining, and Peploe's use of Mayan Indians and a kind of eclectic shamanism mixed with magic rings emotionally true. I loved this film and you will, too, if you are not too hung up on logic.
