    Samuel L Jackson excels in this movie as do all the cast. The script is well penned setting the scene perfectly. Some of the cinematography is excellent displaying some fantastic views of the streets of Los-Angeles neatly inter-spliced with subtle atmospheric music. In fairness seven out of ten is a touch conservative as I don't think there is any area where this movie could have been improved. Certainly one of Samuel L Jacksons finest underrated gems. I would definitely watch 187 again if for no other reason then to see some of those sumptuous camera angles once more.

    OK, so this is not going to be Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman or even Dangerous Minds released just a year earlier. It's much darker and I have no problem with a film not following a conventional plot, in fact, I encourage it. But what should have ended as a halfway thought-provoking film fails miserably with a script and dialogue so paper thin you could shred it and horrible acting throughout from just about everyone except Samuel Jackson and John Heard. Also, for a drama film based on reality, there are some unbelievable circumstances throughout. For example, if a teacher was to appear in court as a material witness against a student who committed a crime, do you really think public school administrators would allow the student and teacher to stay at the same school, more less the same dang class?! And yet the principal of the school is always overly sensitive to the possibility that any student-teacher conflict could cause a lawsuit. Yet nobody thought to advise him on how bad of an idea that was? Someone tell me the logic in this. Anyway, the ending will leave you scratching your head while your jaw is still hanging throughout the long ending. You'll be thinking "What just happened?" Was there a lesson learned? Did this ending (or film) have a point; a story to tell? Yes, it does. The story is: There is a reason why this film has been forgotten while great films like Dangerous Minds and Lean on Me have not. Spare yourself the misery.

    "One Eight Seven" holds your attention and entertains. It's also an unusual story with unexpected twists and outcomes. In these respects, it's above average. Samuel L. Jackson teaches in a rough school in Brooklyn, and he is an excellent teacher. However, he is viciously stabbed by a student. The film, written by a high school teacher, lets us know in no uncertain terms that teaching in many city schools is now a dangerous job. He shows us students who are so unruly that they are not fit for classrooms. The film also suggests that these students have legal advantages, such that they can constantly challenge teachers and disrupt classrooms and get away with it. Movies don't provide deep social analyses, and so there are no deep explanations of how these dire conditions in the schools have come about. With this social breakdown as a factor permeating schools, the film explores Jackson's attempt to deal with the stabbing. He leaves Brooklyn and gets a job substituting in a system that is just as bad, which is Los Angeles. Why does he do this? He is still trying to be a TEACHER. He thinks of himself in that social role. He still maintains a degree of hope and faith in the "system" or in his society. He buttresses this with prayer. He hasn't reached the point of giving up on his chosen profession. He's committed to it. But the society and the school rules and a certain number of rebellious young men in his class all conspire to let him down again. He finds himself again a target, despite his goodwill. He still doesn't give up on teaching. Instead, he gives up on social rules and his expectation that society can handle his problems. He goes for personal control of his situation, even to the point of punishing students outside of class for their bad deeds. He becomes his own law. We can only conclude that he is a very confused man. He is getting clear signals to abandon his job, but he tries to stay within this system by controlling it with his own personal and secret violence. This creates an unstable mixture of his own personal law and justice embedded into the societal system, which is itself deeply flawed. The system is paying his salary, but he is going outside it. There is a deep contradiction in this, which is why he is ultimately confused. He attempts to rationalize this confusion. This occurs in the climactic scenes of the movie. (SPOILER AHEAD) He confronts his primary antagonist (Clifton Collins, Jr.) in a duel. It is a suicidal duel. He hopes to alter the values of Collins, even by risking his own life. This action is hopelessly naive, and it does not work. The value he is trying to alter is "machismo", but he has really made no effort to understand machismo. Collins in fact tells him that machismo is all he has got. He cannot give it up anymore than Jackson has been able to give up on his profession. Society is offering no healthy outlets for the young men who believe in being manly to demonstrate it or feel it. So instead the machismo manifests in rebellion, disruption, graffiti, drugs, guns, needless violence, fights, and so on. Jackson is clueless about this, and he shouldn't be. But that's the story. What he does is challenge the machismo head on, attempting to prove to Collins that it's "stupidity". But it is not stupidity. It is something deeper, cultural, social, and even perhaps part of the aggressive potential in male human beings. Hence, in the end, although the movie is clearly hitting on very important matters that affect all kinds of young people and teachers, the script does not fully rise to the challenge of elucidating the issues behind the problems.

    A powerful story about urban violence and how it can affect inner city schools, this is an excellent little film. Samuel L. Jackson shines as the teacher fed up with his class who eventually begins exact his own kind of justice by bumping off the problem pupils. An atmosphere of simmering violence is built up along with a lot of suspense in a tale that had me hooked. The reliable Jackson puts in an excellent performance as the bitter teacher who has been driven to the edge. The rest of the cast do their jobs well, especially the actors playing the loathsome pupils. What I liked best about this film was the surprising ending, which sees Jackson and his adversaries playing Russian Roulette round a table. A superb ending to what is an interesting, sometimes difficult to watch but still important film. Forget the watered-down crap that most television stations show, this is raw, forceful viewing which asks questions. In fact it reminded me of some of those gritty '70s films, as it has the same hard edge.

    Samuel L. Jackson plays teacher Trevor Garfield in a rough NYC high school. He was a dedicated teacher who felt threatened by a student. Why didn't the principal do something? He gets stabbed several times by the student after leaving the apathetic principal's office! Fifteen months later, he ends up in LA. The sub line called him to sub in one of the most rundown, worst high schools in LA. Subs do not make a lot of money! The average person would have walked out of that school and never returned. But Mr. Garfield stayed for a while until another apathetic principal fired him! Why did Mr. Garfield cry in front of the principal? Embarrassing! And why did he let a female student come into his house anyway? She ended up naked on his sofa! It is obvious that the administration let the students walk all over the teachers in that school. Caesar and Bennie should have been expelled and sent to a detention home! And the history teacher who had a gun in his desk should have been fired on the spot and have his teacher's license revoked! There was one thing that was never proved in the movie. Did Mr. Garfield kill Bennie and cut off Caesar's finger?

    This movie rings true and deserves a good grade. It is very difficult to portray classroom and teacher student relationships authentically and accurately. The scenario has been done many times with varying degrees of success. It must also be mentioned that TV shows have overdone this genre to the point of dumbed down numbness. Unless experienced, the difficulty in reaching and educating in the big city schools today can only be imagined, and fiction usually results in flights of fancy. The students and educators are presented here without much hyperbolic drama, although some encounters are heavy handed but the situations seem real. The ending is abrupt and really takes it to another level, but until then it is a scary and tension filled semester. As this film demonstrates teaching is one of the most underrated, undervalued, under-appreciated, and underpaid of the public service sector. That is unfortunate for our children and the progress of our society.

    The teacher who is attacked in New York find a yearbook with the number 187 written in it. This leads him to believe that his life is being threatened because penal code 187 is supposedly murder. The problem is, in New York, penal code 125 is murder. In California, where he moves, penal code 187 is murder. Using that code in New York is a serious factual error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing and research that goes into a credible movie. Aside from that,the movie is OK, but some of the acting is extremely weak. Even from Hurt and Jackson. The student gangstah parts are particularly weak and clich&eacute;. It's a disappointing attempt at an American version of To Sir With Love, and it doesn't quite make it.

    In the world of 'teacher takes revenge' flicks, we have tons of flops. I think "187" is certainly not one of those flops. It is a film that has held up well since its release in 1997. Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his good performances here. The setting is perfect: a hazy, smoggy east Los Angeles in the 90's. Films like "American Me" and "Falling Down" also captured that 'L.A. thing' well. "187" does that. It makes you feel like you are there. Some of it definitely plays like an after school special, but most of the plot here is gritty and believable...this is no "Class of 1984." Awesome soundtrack with lots of good Massive Attack too. 7 out of 10, kids.

    I have seen a lot of films similar to this from Stand and Deliver to Substitute to Dangerous Minds, but this one was pretty good and I liked it. A New York teacher is stabbed by a gang member because he failed him, so he relocates to L.A. and becomes a sub. There he finds its chocked full of gang members as well. He tries to make a difference, but sees that some of these kids are making it difficult so he becomes a vigilante and wipes out one and tortures others. The kids retaliate and although he helps some students, ultimately its questionable as to whether or not his methods were worth it. The production was pretty good and it was basic, yet it all seemed to somehow stand out from the rest. The acting was great Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for the role, he is one of the coolest actors ever, and it was nice to see him acting scared and being more human and realistic as opposed to being all Bad A**. I thought Method Man did good in his first film too. It's not a gang movie, its a drama about problems being faced in areas that have many gang members. It's always a nice topic to discuss and make people take notice of. A lot of the problems in these areas in and out of the classrooms have to do with the fact many of these kids cant get the educations they need and deserve. I recommend it it to anyone wanting a good drama..4 out of 10 stars..

    After a vicious assault on him, Trevor Garfield, a teacher, moves cities and works as a temp. However, he finds that things are even worse at his new school. Dealing with an important subject, this is immensely engaging and tense. While not based on any specific case, this was written by an actual teacher, and, frankly, it does feel terrifyingly authentic and realistic. The psychology is completely accurate, and this is not black and white. This is well-paced, and never boring. The plot is compelling throughout, and though you can figure some things out before they occur, this most likely *will* surprise you. Every acting performance is spot-on, and all roles are marvelously cast. Jackson is impeccable, and his particular knack for playing someone who holds anger and may lose control at any moment is excellent for this. This has a great soundtrack, with music that fits the environment(which is very nicely established; they found perfect locations and types of people), without making it appealing. The editing and cinematography are incredible, if dangerously close to being flashy. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10

    After a vicious assault on him, Trevor Garfield, a teacher, moves cities and works as a temp. However, he finds that things are even worse at his new school. Dealing with an important subject, this is immensely engaging and tense. While not based on any specific case, this was written by an actual teacher, and, frankly, it does feel terrifyingly authentic and realistic. The psychology is completely accurate, and this is not black and white. This is well-paced, and never boring. The plot is compelling throughout, and though you can figure some things out before they occur, this most likely *will* surprise you. Every acting performance is spot-on, and all roles are marvelously cast. Jackson is impeccable, and his particular knack for playing someone who holds anger and may lose control at any moment is excellent for this. This has a great soundtrack, with music that fits the environment(which is very nicely established; they found perfect locations and types of people), without making it appealing. The editing and cinematography are incredible, if dangerously close to being flashy. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10

    Samuel L Jackson excels in this movie as do all the cast. The script is well penned setting the scene perfectly. Some of the cinematography is excellent displaying some fantastic views of the streets of Los-Angeles neatly inter-spliced with subtle atmospheric music. In fairness seven out of ten is a touch conservative as I don't think there is any area where this movie could have been improved. Certainly one of Samuel L Jacksons finest underrated gems. I would definitely watch 187 again if for no other reason then to see some of those sumptuous camera angles once more.

    OK, so this is not going to be Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman or even Dangerous Minds released just a year earlier. It's much darker and I have no problem with a film not following a conventional plot, in fact, I encourage it. But what should have ended as a halfway thought-provoking film fails miserably with a script and dialogue so paper thin you could shred it and horrible acting throughout from just about everyone except Samuel Jackson and John Heard. Also, for a drama film based on reality, there are some unbelievable circumstances throughout. For example, if a teacher was to appear in court as a material witness against a student who committed a crime, do you really think public school administrators would allow the student and teacher to stay at the same school, more less the same dang class?! And yet the principal of the school is always overly sensitive to the possibility that any student-teacher conflict could cause a lawsuit. Yet nobody thought to advise him on how bad of an idea that was? Someone tell me the logic in this. Anyway, the ending will leave you scratching your head while your jaw is still hanging throughout the long ending. You'll be thinking "What just happened?" Was there a lesson learned? Did this ending (or film) have a point; a story to tell? Yes, it does. The story is: There is a reason why this film has been forgotten while great films like Dangerous Minds and Lean on Me have not. Spare yourself the misery.

    "One Eight Seven" holds your attention and entertains. It's also an unusual story with unexpected twists and outcomes. In these respects, it's above average. Samuel L. Jackson teaches in a rough school in Brooklyn, and he is an excellent teacher. However, he is viciously stabbed by a student. The film, written by a high school teacher, lets us know in no uncertain terms that teaching in many city schools is now a dangerous job. He shows us students who are so unruly that they are not fit for classrooms. The film also suggests that these students have legal advantages, such that they can constantly challenge teachers and disrupt classrooms and get away with it. Movies don't provide deep social analyses, and so there are no deep explanations of how these dire conditions in the schools have come about. With this social breakdown as a factor permeating schools, the film explores Jackson's attempt to deal with the stabbing. He leaves Brooklyn and gets a job substituting in a system that is just as bad, which is Los Angeles. Why does he do this? He is still trying to be a TEACHER. He thinks of himself in that social role. He still maintains a degree of hope and faith in the "system" or in his society. He buttresses this with prayer. He hasn't reached the point of giving up on his chosen profession. He's committed to it. But the society and the school rules and a certain number of rebellious young men in his class all conspire to let him down again. He finds himself again a target, despite his goodwill. He still doesn't give up on teaching. Instead, he gives up on social rules and his expectation that society can handle his problems. He goes for personal control of his situation, even to the point of punishing students outside of class for their bad deeds. He becomes his own law. We can only conclude that he is a very confused man. He is getting clear signals to abandon his job, but he tries to stay within this system by controlling it with his own personal and secret violence. This creates an unstable mixture of his own personal law and justice embedded into the societal system, which is itself deeply flawed. The system is paying his salary, but he is going outside it. There is a deep contradiction in this, which is why he is ultimately confused. He attempts to rationalize this confusion. This occurs in the climactic scenes of the movie. (SPOILER AHEAD) He confronts his primary antagonist (Clifton Collins, Jr.) in a duel. It is a suicidal duel. He hopes to alter the values of Collins, even by risking his own life. This action is hopelessly naive, and it does not work. The value he is trying to alter is "machismo", but he has really made no effort to understand machismo. Collins in fact tells him that machismo is all he has got. He cannot give it up anymore than Jackson has been able to give up on his profession. Society is offering no healthy outlets for the young men who believe in being manly to demonstrate it or feel it. So instead the machismo manifests in rebellion, disruption, graffiti, drugs, guns, needless violence, fights, and so on. Jackson is clueless about this, and he shouldn't be. But that's the story. What he does is challenge the machismo head on, attempting to prove to Collins that it's "stupidity". But it is not stupidity. It is something deeper, cultural, social, and even perhaps part of the aggressive potential in male human beings. Hence, in the end, although the movie is clearly hitting on very important matters that affect all kinds of young people and teachers, the script does not fully rise to the challenge of elucidating the issues behind the problems.

    A powerful story about urban violence and how it can affect inner city schools, this is an excellent little film. Samuel L. Jackson shines as the teacher fed up with his class who eventually begins exact his own kind of justice by bumping off the problem pupils. An atmosphere of simmering violence is built up along with a lot of suspense in a tale that had me hooked. The reliable Jackson puts in an excellent performance as the bitter teacher who has been driven to the edge. The rest of the cast do their jobs well, especially the actors playing the loathsome pupils. What I liked best about this film was the surprising ending, which sees Jackson and his adversaries playing Russian Roulette round a table. A superb ending to what is an interesting, sometimes difficult to watch but still important film. Forget the watered-down crap that most television stations show, this is raw, forceful viewing which asks questions. In fact it reminded me of some of those gritty '70s films, as it has the same hard edge.

    Samuel L. Jackson plays teacher Trevor Garfield in a rough NYC high school. He was a dedicated teacher who felt threatened by a student. Why didn't the principal do something? He gets stabbed several times by the student after leaving the apathetic principal's office! Fifteen months later, he ends up in LA. The sub line called him to sub in one of the most rundown, worst high schools in LA. Subs do not make a lot of money! The average person would have walked out of that school and never returned. But Mr. Garfield stayed for a while until another apathetic principal fired him! Why did Mr. Garfield cry in front of the principal? Embarrassing! And why did he let a female student come into his house anyway? She ended up naked on his sofa! It is obvious that the administration let the students walk all over the teachers in that school. Caesar and Bennie should have been expelled and sent to a detention home! And the history teacher who had a gun in his desk should have been fired on the spot and have his teacher's license revoked! There was one thing that was never proved in the movie. Did Mr. Garfield kill Bennie and cut off Caesar's finger?

    This movie rings true and deserves a good grade. It is very difficult to portray classroom and teacher student relationships authentically and accurately. The scenario has been done many times with varying degrees of success. It must also be mentioned that TV shows have overdone this genre to the point of dumbed down numbness. Unless experienced, the difficulty in reaching and educating in the big city schools today can only be imagined, and fiction usually results in flights of fancy. The students and educators are presented here without much hyperbolic drama, although some encounters are heavy handed but the situations seem real. The ending is abrupt and really takes it to another level, but until then it is a scary and tension filled semester. As this film demonstrates teaching is one of the most underrated, undervalued, under-appreciated, and underpaid of the public service sector. That is unfortunate for our children and the progress of our society.

    The teacher who is attacked in New York find a yearbook with the number 187 written in it. This leads him to believe that his life is being threatened because penal code 187 is supposedly murder. The problem is, in New York, penal code 125 is murder. In California, where he moves, penal code 187 is murder. Using that code in New York is a serious factual error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing and research that goes into a credible movie. Aside from that,the movie is OK, but some of the acting is extremely weak. Even from Hurt and Jackson. The student gangstah parts are particularly weak and clich&eacute;. It's a disappointing attempt at an American version of To Sir With Love, and it doesn't quite make it.

    In the world of 'teacher takes revenge' flicks, we have tons of flops. I think "187" is certainly not one of those flops. It is a film that has held up well since its release in 1997. Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his good performances here. The setting is perfect: a hazy, smoggy east Los Angeles in the 90's. Films like "American Me" and "Falling Down" also captured that 'L.A. thing' well. "187" does that. It makes you feel like you are there. Some of it definitely plays like an after school special, but most of the plot here is gritty and believable...this is no "Class of 1984." Awesome soundtrack with lots of good Massive Attack too. 7 out of 10, kids.

    I have seen a lot of films similar to this from Stand and Deliver to Substitute to Dangerous Minds, but this one was pretty good and I liked it. A New York teacher is stabbed by a gang member because he failed him, so he relocates to L.A. and becomes a sub. There he finds its chocked full of gang members as well. He tries to make a difference, but sees that some of these kids are making it difficult so he becomes a vigilante and wipes out one and tortures others. The kids retaliate and although he helps some students, ultimately its questionable as to whether or not his methods were worth it. The production was pretty good and it was basic, yet it all seemed to somehow stand out from the rest. The acting was great Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for the role, he is one of the coolest actors ever, and it was nice to see him acting scared and being more human and realistic as opposed to being all Bad A**. I thought Method Man did good in his first film too. It's not a gang movie, its a drama about problems being faced in areas that have many gang members. It's always a nice topic to discuss and make people take notice of. A lot of the problems in these areas in and out of the classrooms have to do with the fact many of these kids cant get the educations they need and deserve. I recommend it it to anyone wanting a good drama..4 out of 10 stars..

Every acting performance is spot-on, and all roles are marvelously cast. Jackson is impeccable, and his particular knack for playing someone who holds anger and may lose control at any moment is excellent for this. This has a great soundtrack, with music that fits the environment(which is very nicely established; they found perfect locations and types of people), without making it appealing. The editing and cinematography are incredible, if dangerously close to being flashy. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10

    Samuel L Jackson excels in this movie as do all the cast. The script is well penned setting the scene perfectly. Some of the cinematography is excellent displaying some fantastic views of the streets of Los-Angeles neatly inter-spliced with subtle atmospheric music. In fairness seven out of ten is a touch conservative as I don't think there is any area where this movie could have been improved. Certainly one of Samuel L Jacksons finest underrated gems. I would definitely watch 187 again if for no other reason then to see some of those sumptuous camera angles once more.

    OK, so this is not going to be Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman or even Dangerous Minds released just a year earlier. It's much darker and I have no problem with a film not following a conventional plot, in fact, I encourage it. But what should have ended as a halfway thought-provoking film fails miserably with a script and dialogue so paper thin you could shred it and horrible acting throughout from just about everyone except Samuel Jackson and John Heard. Also, for a drama film based on reality, there are some unbelievable circumstances throughout. For example, if a teacher was to appear in court as a material witness against a student who committed a crime, do you really think public school administrators would allow the student and teacher to stay at the same school, more less the same dang class?! And yet the principal of the school is always overly sensitive to the possibility that any student-teacher conflict could cause a lawsuit. Yet nobody thought to advise him on how bad of an idea that was? Someone tell me the logic in this. Anyway, the ending will leave you scratching your head while your jaw is still hanging throughout the long ending. You'll be thinking "What just happened?" Was there a lesson learned? Did this ending (or film) have a point; a story to tell? Yes, it does. The story is: There is a reason why this film has been forgotten while great films like Dangerous Minds and Lean on Me have not. Spare yourself the misery.

    "One Eight Seven" holds your attention and entertains. It's also an unusual story with unexpected twists and outcomes. In these respects, it's above average. Samuel L. Jackson teaches in a rough school in Brooklyn, and he is an excellent teacher. However, he is viciously stabbed by a student. The film, written by a high school teacher, lets us know in no uncertain terms that teaching in many city schools is now a dangerous job. He shows us students who are so unruly that they are not fit for classrooms. The film also suggests that these students have legal advantages, such that they can constantly challenge teachers and disrupt classrooms and get away with it. Movies don't provide deep social analyses, and so there are no deep explanations of how these dire conditions in the schools have come about. With this social breakdown as a factor permeating schools, the film explores Jackson's attempt to deal with the stabbing. He leaves Brooklyn and gets a job substituting in a system that is just as bad, which is Los Angeles. Why does he do this? He is still trying to be a TEACHER. He thinks of himself in that social role. He still maintains a degree of hope and faith in the "system" or in his society. He buttresses this with prayer. He hasn't reached the point of giving up on his chosen profession. He's committed to it. But the society and the school rules and a certain number of rebellious young men in his class all conspire to let him down again. He finds himself again a target, despite his goodwill. He still doesn't give up on teaching. Instead, he gives up on social rules and his expectation that society can handle his problems. He goes for personal control of his situation, even to the point of punishing students outside of class for their bad deeds. He becomes his own law. We can only conclude that he is a very confused man. He is getting clear signals to abandon his job, but he tries to stay within this system by controlling it with his own personal and secret violence. This creates an unstable mixture of his own personal law and justice embedded into the societal system, which is itself deeply flawed. The system is paying his salary, but he is going outside it. There is a deep contradiction in this, which is why he is ultimately confused. He attempts to rationalize this confusion. This occurs in the climactic scenes of the movie. (SPOILER AHEAD) He confronts his primary antagonist (Clifton Collins, Jr.) in a duel. It is a suicidal duel. He hopes to alter the values of Collins, even by risking his own life. This action is hopelessly naive, and it does not work. The value he is trying to alter is "machismo", but he has really made no effort to understand machismo. Collins in fact tells him that machismo is all he has got. He cannot give it up anymore than Jackson has been able to give up on his profession. Society is offering no healthy outlets for the young men who believe in being manly to demonstrate it or feel it. So instead the machismo manifests in rebellion, disruption, graffiti, drugs, guns, needless violence, fights, and so on. Jackson is clueless about this, and he shouldn't be. But that's the story. What he does is challenge the machismo head on, attempting to prove to Collins that it's "stupidity". But it is not stupidity. It is something deeper, cultural, social, and even perhaps part of the aggressive potential in male human beings. Hence, in the end, although the movie is clearly hitting on very important matters that affect all kinds of young people and teachers, the script does not fully rise to the challenge of elucidating the issues behind the problems.

    A powerful story about urban violence and how it can affect inner city schools, this is an excellent little film. Samuel L. Jackson shines as the teacher fed up with his class who eventually begins exact his own kind of justice by bumping off the problem pupils. An atmosphere of simmering violence is built up along with a lot of suspense in a tale that had me hooked. The reliable Jackson puts in an excellent performance as the bitter teacher who has been driven to the edge. The rest of the cast do their jobs well, especially the actors playing the loathsome pupils. What I liked best about this film was the surprising ending, which sees Jackson and his adversaries playing Russian Roulette round a table. A superb ending to what is an interesting, sometimes difficult to watch but still important film. Forget the watered-down crap that most television stations show, this is raw, forceful viewing which asks questions. In fact it reminded me of some of those gritty '70s films, as it has the same hard edge.

    Samuel L. Jackson plays teacher Trevor Garfield in a rough NYC high school. He was a dedicated teacher who felt threatened by a student. Why didn't the principal do something? He gets stabbed several times by the student after leaving the apathetic principal's office! Fifteen months later, he ends up in LA. The sub line called him to sub in one of the most rundown, worst high schools in LA. Subs do not make a lot of money! The average person would have walked out of that school and never returned. But Mr. Garfield stayed for a while until another apathetic principal fired him! Why did Mr. Garfield cry in front of the principal? Embarrassing! And why did he let a female student come into his house anyway? She ended up naked on his sofa! It is obvious that the administration let the students walk all over the teachers in that school. Caesar and Bennie should have been expelled and sent to a detention home! And the history teacher who had a gun in his desk should have been fired on the spot and have his teacher's license revoked! There was one thing that was never proved in the movie. Did Mr. Garfield kill Bennie and cut off Caesar's finger?

    This movie rings true and deserves a good grade. It is very difficult to portray classroom and teacher student relationships authentically and accurately. The scenario has been done many times with varying degrees of success. It must also be mentioned that TV shows have overdone this genre to the point of dumbed down numbness. Unless experienced, the difficulty in reaching and educating in the big city schools today can only be imagined, and fiction usually results in flights of fancy. The students and educators are presented here without much hyperbolic drama, although some encounters are heavy handed but the situations seem real. The ending is abrupt and really takes it to another level, but until then it is a scary and tension filled semester. As this film demonstrates teaching is one of the most underrated, undervalued, under-appreciated, and underpaid of the public service sector. That is unfortunate for our children and the progress of our society.

    The teacher who is attacked in New York find a yearbook with the number 187 written in it. This leads him to believe that his life is being threatened because penal code 187 is supposedly murder. The problem is, in New York, penal code 125 is murder. In California, where he moves, penal code 187 is murder. Using that code in New York is a serious factual error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing and research that goes into a credible movie. Aside from that,the movie is OK, but some of the acting is extremely weak. Even from Hurt and Jackson. The student gangstah parts are particularly weak and clich&eacute;. It's a disappointing attempt at an American version of To Sir With Love, and it doesn't quite make it.

    In the world of 'teacher takes revenge' flicks, we have tons of flops. I think "187" is certainly not one of those flops. It is a film that has held up well since its release in 1997. Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his good performances here. The setting is perfect: a hazy, smoggy east Los Angeles in the 90's. Films like "American Me" and "Falling Down" also captured that 'L.A. thing' well. "187" does that. It makes you feel like you are there. Some of it definitely plays like an after school special, but most of the plot here is gritty and believable...this is no "Class of 1984." Awesome soundtrack with lots of good Massive Attack too. 7 out of 10, kids.

    I have seen a lot of films similar to this from Stand and Deliver to Substitute to Dangerous Minds, but this one was pretty good and I liked it. A New York teacher is stabbed by a gang member because he failed him, so he relocates to L.A. and becomes a sub. There he finds its chocked full of gang members as well. He tries to make a difference, but sees that some of these kids are making it difficult so he becomes a vigilante and wipes out one and tortures others. The kids retaliate and although he helps some students, ultimately its questionable as to whether or not his methods were worth it. The production was pretty good and it was basic, yet it all seemed to somehow stand out from the rest. The acting was great Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for the role, he is one of the coolest actors ever, and it was nice to see him acting scared and being more human and realistic as opposed to being all Bad A**. I thought Method Man did good in his first film too. It's not a gang movie, its a drama about problems being faced in areas that have many gang members. It's always a nice topic to discuss and make people take notice of. A lot of the problems in these areas in and out of the classrooms have to do with the fact many of these kids cant get the educations they need and deserve. I recommend it it to anyone wanting a good drama..4 out of 10 stars..

    After a vicious assault on him, Trevor Garfield, a teacher, moves cities and works as a temp. However, he finds that things are even worse at his new school. Dealing with an important subject, this is immensely engaging and tense.

There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10

    Samuel L Jackson excels in this movie as do all the cast. The script is well penned setting the scene perfectly. Some of the cinematography is excellent displaying some fantastic views of the streets of Los-Angeles neatly inter-spliced with subtle atmospheric music. In fairness seven out of ten is a touch conservative as I don't think there is any area where this movie could have been improved. Certainly one of Samuel L Jacksons finest underrated gems. I would definitely watch 187 again if for no other reason then to see some of those sumptuous camera angles once more.

    OK, so this is not going to be Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman or even Dangerous Minds released just a year earlier. It's much darker and I have no problem with a film not following a conventional plot, in fact, I encourage it. But what should have ended as a halfway thought-provoking film fails miserably with a script and dialogue so paper thin you could shred it and horrible acting throughout from just about everyone except Samuel Jackson and John Heard. Also, for a drama film based on reality, there are some unbelievable circumstances throughout. For example, if a teacher was to appear in court as a material witness against a student who committed a crime, do you really think public school administrators would allow the student and teacher to stay at the same school, more less the same dang class?! And yet the principal of the school is always overly sensitive to the possibility that any student-teacher conflict could cause a lawsuit. Yet nobody thought to advise him on how bad of an idea that was? Someone tell me the logic in this. Anyway, the ending will leave you scratching your head while your jaw is still hanging throughout the long ending. You'll be thinking "What just happened?" Was there a lesson learned? Did this ending (or film) have a point; a story to tell? Yes, it does. The story is: There is a reason why this film has been forgotten while great films like Dangerous Minds and Lean on Me have not. Spare yourself the misery.

    "One Eight Seven" holds your attention and entertains. It's also an unusual story with unexpected twists and outcomes. In these respects, it's above average. Samuel L. Jackson teaches in a rough school in Brooklyn, and he is an excellent teacher. However, he is viciously stabbed by a student. The film, written by a high school teacher, lets us know in no uncertain terms that teaching in many city schools is now a dangerous job. He shows us students who are so unruly that they are not fit for classrooms. The film also suggests that these students have legal advantages, such that they can constantly challenge teachers and disrupt classrooms and get away with it. Movies don't provide deep social analyses, and so there are no deep explanations of how these dire conditions in the schools have come about. With this social breakdown as a factor permeating schools, the film explores Jackson's attempt to deal with the stabbing. He leaves Brooklyn and gets a job substituting in a system that is just as bad, which is Los Angeles. Why does he do this? He is still trying to be a TEACHER. He thinks of himself in that social role. He still maintains a degree of hope and faith in the "system" or in his society. He buttresses this with prayer. He hasn't reached the point of giving up on his chosen profession. He's committed to it. But the society and the school rules and a certain number of rebellious young men in his class all conspire to let him down again. He finds himself again a target, despite his goodwill. He still doesn't give up on teaching. Instead, he gives up on social rules and his expectation that society can handle his problems. He goes for personal control of his situation, even to the point of punishing students outside of class for their bad deeds. He becomes his own law. We can only conclude that he is a very confused man. He is getting clear signals to abandon his job, but he tries to stay within this system by controlling it with his own personal and secret violence. This creates an unstable mixture of his own personal law and justice embedded into the societal system, which is itself deeply flawed. The system is paying his salary, but he is going outside it. There is a deep contradiction in this, which is why he is ultimately confused. He attempts to rationalize this confusion. This occurs in the climactic scenes of the movie. (SPOILER AHEAD) He confronts his primary antagonist (Clifton Collins, Jr.) in a duel. It is a suicidal duel. He hopes to alter the values of Collins, even by risking his own life. This action is hopelessly naive, and it does not work. The value he is trying to alter is "machismo", but he has really made no effort to understand machismo. Collins in fact tells him that machismo is all he has got. He cannot give it up anymore than Jackson has been able to give up on his profession. Society is offering no healthy outlets for the young men who believe in being manly to demonstrate it or feel it. So instead the machismo manifests in rebellion, disruption, graffiti, drugs, guns, needless violence, fights, and so on. Jackson is clueless about this, and he shouldn't be. But that's the story. What he does is challenge the machismo head on, attempting to prove to Collins that it's "stupidity". But it is not stupidity. It is something deeper, cultural, social, and even perhaps part of the aggressive potential in male human beings. Hence, in the end, although the movie is clearly hitting on very important matters that affect all kinds of young people and teachers, the script does not fully rise to the challenge of elucidating the issues behind the problems.

    A powerful story about urban violence and how it can affect inner city schools, this is an excellent little film. Samuel L. Jackson shines as the teacher fed up with his class who eventually begins exact his own kind of justice by bumping off the problem pupils. An atmosphere of simmering violence is built up along with a lot of suspense in a tale that had me hooked. The reliable Jackson puts in an excellent performance as the bitter teacher who has been driven to the edge. The rest of the cast do their jobs well, especially the actors playing the loathsome pupils. What I liked best about this film was the surprising ending, which sees Jackson and his adversaries playing Russian Roulette round a table. A superb ending to what is an interesting, sometimes difficult to watch but still important film. Forget the watered-down crap that most television stations show, this is raw, forceful viewing which asks questions. In fact it reminded me of some of those gritty '70s films, as it has the same hard edge.

    Samuel L. Jackson plays teacher Trevor Garfield in a rough NYC high school. He was a dedicated teacher who felt threatened by a student. Why didn't the principal do something? He gets stabbed several times by the student after leaving the apathetic principal's office! Fifteen months later, he ends up in LA. The sub line called him to sub in one of the most rundown, worst high schools in LA. Subs do not make a lot of money! The average person would have walked out of that school and never returned. But Mr. Garfield stayed for a while until another apathetic principal fired him! Why did Mr. Garfield cry in front of the principal? Embarrassing! And why did he let a female student come into his house anyway? She ended up naked on his sofa! It is obvious that the administration let the students walk all over the teachers in that school. Caesar and Bennie should have been expelled and sent to a detention home! And the history teacher who had a gun in his desk should have been fired on the spot and have his teacher's license revoked! There was one thing that was never proved in the movie. Did Mr. Garfield kill Bennie and cut off Caesar's finger?

    This movie rings true and deserves a good grade. It is very difficult to portray classroom and teacher student relationships authentically and accurately. The scenario has been done many times with varying degrees of success. It must also be mentioned that TV shows have overdone this genre to the point of dumbed down numbness. Unless experienced, the difficulty in reaching and educating in the big city schools today can only be imagined, and fiction usually results in flights of fancy. The students and educators are presented here without much hyperbolic drama, although some encounters are heavy handed but the situations seem real. The ending is abrupt and really takes it to another level, but until then it is a scary and tension filled semester. As this film demonstrates teaching is one of the most underrated, undervalued, under-appreciated, and underpaid of the public service sector. That is unfortunate for our children and the progress of our society.

    The teacher who is attacked in New York find a yearbook with the number 187 written in it. This leads him to believe that his life is being threatened because penal code 187 is supposedly murder. The problem is, in New York, penal code 125 is murder. In California, where he moves, penal code 187 is murder. Using that code in New York is a serious factual error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing and research that goes into a credible movie. Aside from that,the movie is OK, but some of the acting is extremely weak. Even from Hurt and Jackson. The student gangstah parts are particularly weak and clich&eacute;. It's a disappointing attempt at an American version of To Sir With Love, and it doesn't quite make it.

    In the world of 'teacher takes revenge' flicks, we have tons of flops. I think "187" is certainly not one of those flops. It is a film that has held up well since its release in 1997. Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his good performances here. The setting is perfect: a hazy, smoggy east Los Angeles in the 90's. Films like "American Me" and "Falling Down" also captured that 'L.A. thing' well. "187" does that. It makes you feel like you are there. Some of it definitely plays like an after school special, but most of the plot here is gritty and believable...this is no "Class of 1984." Awesome soundtrack with lots of good Massive Attack too. 7 out of 10, kids.

    I have seen a lot of films similar to this from Stand and Deliver to Substitute to Dangerous Minds, but this one was pretty good and I liked it. A New York teacher is stabbed by a gang member because he failed him, so he relocates to L.A. and becomes a sub. There he finds its chocked full of gang members as well. He tries to make a difference, but sees that some of these kids are making it difficult so he becomes a vigilante and wipes out one and tortures others. The kids retaliate and although he helps some students, ultimately its questionable as to whether or not his methods were worth it. The production was pretty good and it was basic, yet it all seemed to somehow stand out from the rest. The acting was great Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for the role, he is one of the coolest actors ever, and it was nice to see him acting scared and being more human and realistic as opposed to being all Bad A**. I thought Method Man did good in his first film too. It's not a gang movie, its a drama about problems being faced in areas that have many gang members. It's always a nice topic to discuss and make people take notice of. A lot of the problems in these areas in and out of the classrooms have to do with the fact many of these kids cant get the educations they need and deserve. I recommend it it to anyone wanting a good drama..4 out of 10 stars..

    After a vicious assault on him, Trevor Garfield, a teacher, moves cities and works as a temp. However, he finds that things are even worse at his new school. Dealing with an important subject, this is immensely engaging and tense. While not based on any specific case, this was written by an actual teacher, and, frankly, it does feel terrifyingly authentic and realistic. The psychology is completely accurate, and this is not black and white. This is well-paced, and never boring. The plot is compelling throughout, and though you can figure some things out before they occur, this most likely *will* surprise you. Every acting performance is spot-on, and all roles are marvelously cast. Jackson is impeccable, and his particular knack for playing someone who holds anger and may lose control at any moment is excellent for this. This has a great soundtrack, with music that fits the environment(which is very nicely established; they found perfect locations and types of people), without making it appealing. The editing and cinematography are incredible, if dangerously close to being flashy. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10

    Samuel L Jackson excels in this movie as do all the cast. The script is well penned setting the scene perfectly. Some of the cinematography is excellent displaying some fantastic views of the streets of Los-Angeles neatly inter-spliced with subtle atmospheric music. In fairness seven out of ten is a touch conservative as I don't think there is any area where this movie could have been improved. Certainly one of Samuel L Jacksons finest underrated gems. I would definitely watch 187 again if for no other reason then to see some of those sumptuous camera angles once more.

    OK, so this is not going to be Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman or even Dangerous Minds released just a year earlier. It's much darker and I have no problem with a film not following a conventional plot, in fact, I encourage it. But what should have ended as a halfway thought-provoking film fails miserably with a script and dialogue so paper thin you could shred it and horrible acting throughout from just about everyone except Samuel Jackson and John Heard. Also, for a drama film based on reality, there are some unbelievable circumstances throughout. For example, if a teacher was to appear in court as a material witness against a student who committed a crime, do you really think public school administrators would allow the student and teacher to stay at the same school, more less the same dang class?! And yet the principal of the school is always overly sensitive to the possibility that any student-teacher conflict could cause a lawsuit. Yet nobody thought to advise him on how bad of an idea that was? Someone tell me the logic in this. Anyway, the ending will leave you scratching your head while your jaw is still hanging throughout the long ending. You'll be thinking "What just happened?" Was there a lesson learned? Did this ending (or film) have a point; a story to tell? Yes, it does. The story is: There is a reason why this film has been forgotten while great films like Dangerous Minds and Lean on Me have not. Spare yourself the misery.

    "One Eight Seven" holds your attention and entertains. It's also an unusual story with unexpected twists and outcomes. In these respects, it's above average. Samuel L. Jackson teaches in a rough school in Brooklyn, and he is an excellent teacher. However, he is viciously stabbed by a student. The film, written by a high school teacher, lets us know in no uncertain terms that teaching in many city schools is now a dangerous job. He shows us students who are so unruly that they are not fit for classrooms. The film also suggests that these students have legal advantages, such that they can constantly challenge teachers and disrupt classrooms and get away with it. Movies don't provide deep social analyses, and so there are no deep explanations of how these dire conditions in the schools have come about. With this social breakdown as a factor permeating schools, the film explores Jackson's attempt to deal with the stabbing. He leaves Brooklyn and gets a job substituting in a system that is just as bad, which is Los Angeles. Why does he do this? He is still trying to be a TEACHER. He thinks of himself in that social role. He still maintains a degree of hope and faith in the "system" or in his society. He buttresses this with prayer. He hasn't reached the point of giving up on his chosen profession. He's committed to it. But the society and the school rules and a certain number of rebellious young men in his class all conspire to let him down again. He finds himself again a target, despite his goodwill. He still doesn't give up on teaching. Instead, he gives up on social rules and his expectation that society can handle his problems. He goes for personal control of his situation, even to the point of punishing students outside of class for their bad deeds. He becomes his own law. We can only conclude that he is a very confused man. He is getting clear signals to abandon his job, but he tries to stay within this system by controlling it with his own personal and secret violence. This creates an unstable mixture of his own personal law and justice embedded into the societal system, which is itself deeply flawed. The system is paying his salary, but he is going outside it. There is a deep contradiction in this, which is why he is ultimately confused. He attempts to rationalize this confusion. This occurs in the climactic scenes of the movie. (SPOILER AHEAD) He confronts his primary antagonist (Clifton Collins, Jr.) in a duel. It is a suicidal duel. He hopes to alter the values of Collins, even by risking his own life. This action is hopelessly naive, and it does not work. The value he is trying to alter is "machismo", but he has really made no effort to understand machismo. Collins in fact tells him that machismo is all he has got. He cannot give it up anymore than Jackson has been able to give up on his profession. Society is offering no healthy outlets for the young men who believe in being manly to demonstrate it or feel it. So instead the machismo manifests in rebellion, disruption, graffiti, drugs, guns, needless violence, fights, and so on. Jackson is clueless about this, and he shouldn't be. But that's the story. What he does is challenge the machismo head on, attempting to prove to Collins that it's "stupidity". But it is not stupidity. It is something deeper, cultural, social, and even perhaps part of the aggressive potential in male human beings. Hence, in the end, although the movie is clearly hitting on very important matters that affect all kinds of young people and teachers, the script does not fully rise to the challenge of elucidating the issues behind the problems.

    A powerful story about urban violence and how it can affect inner city schools, this is an excellent little film. Samuel L. Jackson shines as the teacher fed up with his class who eventually begins exact his own kind of justice by bumping off the problem pupils. An atmosphere of simmering violence is built up along with a lot of suspense in a tale that had me hooked. The reliable Jackson puts in an excellent performance as the bitter teacher who has been driven to the edge. The rest of the cast do their jobs well, especially the actors playing the loathsome pupils. What I liked best about this film was the surprising ending, which sees Jackson and his adversaries playing Russian Roulette round a table. A superb ending to what is an interesting, sometimes difficult to watch but still important film. Forget the watered-down crap that most television stations show, this is raw, forceful viewing which asks questions. In fact it reminded me of some of those gritty '70s films, as it has the same hard edge.

    Samuel L. Jackson plays teacher Trevor Garfield in a rough NYC high school. He was a dedicated teacher who felt threatened by a student. Why didn't the principal do something? He gets stabbed several times by the student after leaving the apathetic principal's office! Fifteen months later, he ends up in LA. The sub line called him to sub in one of the most rundown, worst high schools in LA. Subs do not make a lot of money! The average person would have walked out of that school and never returned. But Mr. Garfield stayed for a while until another apathetic principal fired him! Why did Mr. Garfield cry in front of the principal? Embarrassing! And why did he let a female student come into his house anyway? She ended up naked on his sofa! It is obvious that the administration let the students walk all over the teachers in that school. Caesar and Bennie should have been expelled and sent to a detention home! And the history teacher who had a gun in his desk should have been fired on the spot and have his teacher's license revoked! There was one thing that was never proved in the movie. Did Mr. Garfield kill Bennie and cut off Caesar's finger?

    This movie rings true and deserves a good grade. It is very difficult to portray classroom and teacher student relationships authentically and accurately. The scenario has been done many times with varying degrees of success. It must also be mentioned that TV shows have overdone this genre to the point of dumbed down numbness. Unless experienced, the difficulty in reaching and educating in the big city schools today can only be imagined, and fiction usually results in flights of fancy. The students and educators are presented here without much hyperbolic drama, although some encounters are heavy handed but the situations seem real. The ending is abrupt and really takes it to another level, but until then it is a scary and tension filled semester. As this film demonstrates teaching is one of the most underrated, undervalued, under-appreciated, and underpaid of the public service sector. That is unfortunate for our children and the progress of our society.

    The teacher who is attacked in New York find a yearbook with the number 187 written in it. This leads him to believe that his life is being threatened because penal code 187 is supposedly murder. The problem is, in New York, penal code 125 is murder. In California, where he moves, penal code 187 is murder. Using that code in New York is a serious factual error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing and research that goes into a credible movie. Aside from that,the movie is OK, but some of the acting is extremely weak. Even from Hurt and Jackson. The student gangstah parts are particularly weak and clich&eacute;. It's a disappointing attempt at an American version of To Sir With Love, and it doesn't quite make it.

    In the world of 'teacher takes revenge' flicks, we have tons of flops. I think "187" is certainly not one of those flops. It is a film that has held up well since its release in 1997. Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his good performances here. The setting is perfect: a hazy, smoggy east Los Angeles in the 90's. Films like "American Me" and "Falling Down" also captured that 'L.A. thing' well. "187" does that. It makes you feel like you are there. Some of it definitely plays like an after school special, but most of the plot here is gritty and believable...this is no "Class of 1984." Awesome soundtrack with lots of good Massive Attack too. 7 out of 10, kids.

    I have seen a lot of films similar to this from Stand and Deliver to Substitute to Dangerous Minds, but this one was pretty good and I liked it. A New York teacher is stabbed by a gang member because he failed him, so he relocates to L.A. and becomes a sub. There he finds its chocked full of gang members as well. He tries to make a difference, but sees that some of these kids are making it difficult so he becomes a vigilante and wipes out one and tortures others. The kids retaliate and although he helps some students, ultimately its questionable as to whether or not his methods were worth it. The production was pretty good and it was basic, yet it all seemed to somehow stand out from the rest. The acting was great Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for the role, he is one of the coolest actors ever, and it was nice to see him acting scared and being more human and realistic as opposed to being all Bad A**. I thought Method Man did good in his first film too. It's not a gang movie, its a drama about problems being faced in areas that have many gang members. It's always a nice topic to discuss and make people take notice of. A lot of the problems in these areas in and out of the classrooms have to do with the fact many of these kids cant get the educations they need and deserve. I recommend it it to anyone wanting a good drama..4 out of 10 stars..

    After a vicious assault on him, Trevor Garfield, a teacher, moves cities and works as a temp. However, he finds that things are even worse at his new school. Dealing with an important subject, this is immensely engaging and tense. While not based on any specific case, this was written by an actual teacher, and, frankly, it does feel terrifyingly authentic and realistic. The psychology is completely accurate, and this is not black and white. This is well-paced, and never boring. The plot is compelling throughout, and though you can figure some things out before they occur, this most likely *will* surprise you. Every acting performance is spot-on, and all roles are marvelously cast. Jackson is impeccable, and his particular knack for playing someone who holds anger and may lose control at any moment is excellent for this. This has a great soundtrack, with music that fits the environment(which is very nicely established; they found perfect locations and types of people), without making it appealing. The editing and cinematography are incredible, if dangerously close to being flashy. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence, a lot of disturbing content, moderately frequent strong language and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 7/10
