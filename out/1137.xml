 <sinopse>
  In a suburb of London, young Jamie is escaping sport hours, to avoid being the victim of his comrades. Young Ste, his neighbor, is beaten by his father, and comes to sleep overnight. They discover new feelings, sleeping in the same bed.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A tender love story set during a hot summer on a South-East London housing estate. Jamie, a relatively unpopular lad who bunks off school to avoid football, lives next door to Ste, a more popular athletic lad but who is frequently beaten up by his father and older brother. Such an episode of violence brings Jamie and Ste together: Sandra (Jamie's mum) offers refugee to Ste, who has to 'top-and-tail' with Jamie. Hence, the story tells of their growing attraction for one another, from initial lingering glances to their irrefutable love, which so magnificently illustrated at the end of the film. In deals with the tribulations of coming to terms with their sexuality and of others finding out, in light of Sandra's unwavering loyalty and defence of Jamie and the fear of repercussion should Ste's family find out. The plot is set against sub-texts of Sandra's desire to manage her own pub, and thus escape the estate, and of her new relationship with her hippy boyfriend Tony; and of Leah, the ...

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen. This story tells what a lot of gay teens across the world are going through, modern society is a cruel world and does not take likely to different sexually orientated people, but this film shows you that you shouldn't care what others think and that it should be what makes you happy, it is a beautiful film , anyone who watches it will be left with the heart warming urge to find someone like Steven and Jamie, congratulations to these amazing young boys , to me this film is flawless , it has changed my life completely. The romance between the young boys is the cutest thing you will find on film , showing their affections and insecurity. The relationship between Jamie and Sandra is such a passionate bond. This film is high class entertainment, and I shall keep watching it for inspiration to find the one I love 10/10 "most heart warming tale on film to date "

    Subways. And its small life. Gray, talks, neighbors, stories. And a very delicate web of feelings. Love in skin of special definition. Two teenagers and a connection.Searches of self essence and a friendship as a circle. Confuse, scary, strange. But a beautiful way to be yourself. A common piece of existence in water nuances. And nothing all. Touching for the steps of discovery.For the pains and expectations. For the final dance. And for the warm tension in which the happy end is only a crumb. A film like an old song, with lost words and harsh instruments but with a distinct soul who impressive and may be seed of any ours days.

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen. This story tells what a lot of gay teens across the world are going through, modern society is a cruel world and does not take likely to different sexually orientated people, but this film shows you that you shouldn't care what others think and that it should be what makes you happy, it is a beautiful film , anyone who watches it will be left with the heart warming urge to find someone like Steven and Jamie, congratulations to these amazing young boys , to me this film is flawless , it has changed my life completely. The romance between the young boys is the cutest thing you will find on film , showing their affections and insecurity. The relationship between Jamie and Sandra is such a passionate bond. This film is high class entertainment, and I shall keep watching it for inspiration to find the one I love 10/10 "most heart warming tale on film to date "

    Subways. And its small life. Gray, talks, neighbors, stories. And a very delicate web of feelings. Love in skin of special definition. Two teenagers and a connection.Searches of self essence and a friendship as a circle. Confuse, scary, strange. But a beautiful way to be yourself. A common piece of existence in water nuances. And nothing all. Touching for the steps of discovery.For the pains and expectations. For the final dance. And for the warm tension in which the happy end is only a crumb. A film like an old song, with lost words and harsh instruments but with a distinct soul who impressive and may be seed of any ours days.

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich.

And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen. This story tells what a lot of gay teens across the world are going through, modern society is a cruel world and does not take likely to different sexually orientated people, but this film shows you that you shouldn't care what others think and that it should be what makes you happy, it is a beautiful film , anyone who watches it will be left with the heart warming urge to find someone like Steven and Jamie, congratulations to these amazing young boys , to me this film is flawless , it has changed my life completely. The romance between the young boys is the cutest thing you will find on film , showing their affections and insecurity. The relationship between Jamie and Sandra is such a passionate bond. This film is high class entertainment, and I shall keep watching it for inspiration to find the one I love 10/10 "most heart warming tale on film to date "

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen. This story tells what a lot of gay teens across the world are going through, modern society is a cruel world and does not take likely to different sexually orientated people, but this film shows you that you shouldn't care what others think and that it should be what makes you happy, it is a beautiful film , anyone who watches it will be left with the heart warming urge to find someone like Steven and Jamie, congratulations to these amazing young boys , to me this film is flawless , it has changed my life completely. The romance between the young boys is the cutest thing you will find on film , showing their affections and insecurity. The relationship between Jamie and Sandra is such a passionate bond. This film is high class entertainment, and I shall keep watching it for inspiration to find the one I love 10/10 "most heart warming tale on film to date "

    Subways. And its small life. Gray, talks, neighbors, stories. And a very delicate web of feelings. Love in skin of special definition. Two teenagers and a connection.Searches of self essence and a friendship as a circle. Confuse, scary, strange. But a beautiful way to be yourself. A common piece of existence in water nuances. And nothing all. Touching for the steps of discovery.For the pains and expectations. For the final dance. And for the warm tension in which the happy end is only a crumb. A film like an old song, with lost words and harsh instruments but with a distinct soul who impressive and may be seed of any ours days.

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    For me the movie was good, but not excellent. it showed me two guys falling in love, and getting to tell the truth about their sexual orientation. The romance in the movie was very touching, because they were a bit ashamed of it in the beginning of the movie. It felt like is saw my first time falling in love. The acting was good, but not extremely good. Because the Forest kissing scene looked much to fake for me. The jokes throughout the movie were very sarcastic, and i like that. Another thing i noticed was Leah's obsession of Mama Cass, a singer from the mamma's and the papa's. So using her music throughout the movie was very clever. So it's a movie you really have to watch.

    This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen. This story tells what a lot of gay teens across the world are going through, modern society is a cruel world and does not take likely to different sexually orientated people, but this film shows you that you shouldn't care what others think and that it should be what makes you happy, it is a beautiful film , anyone who watches it will be left with the heart warming urge to find someone like Steven and Jamie, congratulations to these amazing young boys , to me this film is flawless , it has changed my life completely. The romance between the young boys is the cutest thing you will find on film , showing their affections and insecurity. The relationship between Jamie and Sandra is such a passionate bond. This film is high class entertainment, and I shall keep watching it for inspiration to find the one I love 10/10 "most heart warming tale on film to date "

    Subways. And its small life. Gray, talks, neighbors, stories. And a very delicate web of feelings. Love in skin of special definition. Two teenagers and a connection.Searches of self essence and a friendship as a circle. Confuse, scary, strange. But a beautiful way to be yourself. A common piece of existence in water nuances. And nothing all. Touching for the steps of discovery.For the pains and expectations. For the final dance. And for the warm tension in which the happy end is only a crumb. A film like an old song, with lost words and harsh instruments but with a distinct soul who impressive and may be seed of any ours days.

    I only just discovered this film after it being on late at night during the current films 4 life, Watched this video for the first time and i could not stop thinking about it constantly over and over again for the past 2 days, Its excellent and best movie I've seen for long time it is such a shame that glen berry (Jamie) dint get more work for this as i really wanted to see him now hes 32 rather than when he was 17. Personally i think its liked more by gay people rather than straight as most straight people are homophobic still but keep it to themselves. Its a shame they did not make a Beautiful things 2, maybe even for the current times as the older selves. I must of watched the video 3 times on DVD (Purchased it today and watched twice) and 4 or 5 times on the internet, I keep going back to the scenes with Jamie's smiles and smirks as cant keep eyes of the parts when Jamie said "Yes i do" at the start when Sandra is moaning about him not going to sports and later on when Jamie is asked what frontage is and his reply :)

    It's been a long time since I've seen this, not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film. Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu. The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively. The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.

    While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it. The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types... Moreover, it is tricky to picture a company where to watch it - shortcomings both for families and gays.

    "Beautiful Thing" is an forthright look into the lives of two average young boys and their harsh life behind closed doors, giving us a modest story without romantic clich&eacute;s or gimmicks. I was thoroughly prepared to like this film a lot, due to how many recommendations I've had from those who knew I favored practical and romantic films like "My Beautiful Laundrette". I only just now finished "Beautiful Thing," and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are "somewhat good/mostly OK." I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar. I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll. I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a "good time" together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little. I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been "figured out", thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.) As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance. "Beautiful Thing" does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love. In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think "Beautiful Thing" is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

    i've heard about this movie for a long time but never got the will to try it, now it caught me on TV and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think it depicts a tale of coming out in a very truthful manner and also it is very sweet, romantic and exciting. at the beginning the mother's story is sort of towering the whole movie and it's a little detaching and uninviting but since the tension between the two boys start to rise it really lures the viewer in. the two male leads are adorable and ste is so handsome! sad he didn't get a breakthrough after this release. there are some very touching moments between two of them and the movie manages to be intimate and sensitive. other than the main romantic story there are several background characters that are also really sweet and are flashed out neatly and get respectively developed. very recommended as a movie about gay characters or even a sweet romantic drama.

    I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it has become one of my favorite movies - it really is a beautiful thing. The characters are all awesome and special. Jamie and Ste are both really adorable and I love it how they're first really awkward around each other but then become closer and fall in love. The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny. We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed. Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act. This movie shows us many things. It's really sweet and beautiful but also hilarious - I laughed so many times during this! The accents were so lovely and the actors marvelous. I really love this.

    London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clich&eacute;s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich&eacute;s if you stick to that and nothing else. But even if this film is full of such clich&eacute;s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich&eacute;s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful. The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it. The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants. The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences. The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.
