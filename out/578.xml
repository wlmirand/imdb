    Demolition Man (1993) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Strange mix of action, sci-fi and satire about enemies (Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes) who do battle thirty-six years after they were genetically frozen. In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is. Snipes clearly steals the film as the sadistic bad guy who will kill anyone who gets in his way. The blonde hair and silly outfit actually manages to look cool with the actor turning in a very fun performance. Stallone is also quite good here and makes for a good hero to go against Snipes. Sandra Bullock gives such a weird and perhaps bad performance that it still comes off rather charming in a bizarre way. Denis Leary is good in his few scenes as are Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. The action scenes are actually pretty good here but these too take a backseat to the various forms of comedy. Again, some of the comedy works but some of it just gets beaten to death and this includes all the cussing fines, which are constantly going off throughout the entire film. The first few times this joke is used it's actually funny but they just run it into the ground. I'd also say the film probably would have benefited from around ten-minutes being cut out. Still, the film is manages to be fun enough to where fans of the stars will want to check it out.

    Demolition Man imagined a future based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots getting worse, and how society would have degenerated from there. This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security. The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs. Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed. It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

    This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.

    Demolition Man (1993) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Strange mix of action, sci-fi and satire about enemies (Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes) who do battle thirty-six years after they were genetically frozen. In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is. Snipes clearly steals the film as the sadistic bad guy who will kill anyone who gets in his way. The blonde hair and silly outfit actually manages to look cool with the actor turning in a very fun performance. Stallone is also quite good here and makes for a good hero to go against Snipes. Sandra Bullock gives such a weird and perhaps bad performance that it still comes off rather charming in a bizarre way. Denis Leary is good in his few scenes as are Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. The action scenes are actually pretty good here but these too take a backseat to the various forms of comedy. Again, some of the comedy works but some of it just gets beaten to death and this includes all the cussing fines, which are constantly going off throughout the entire film. The first few times this joke is used it's actually funny but they just run it into the ground. I'd also say the film probably would have benefited from around ten-minutes being cut out. Still, the film is manages to be fun enough to where fans of the stars will want to check it out.

    Demolition Man imagined a future based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots getting worse, and how society would have degenerated from there. This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security. The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs. Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed. It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

    This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through?

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.

    Demolition Man (1993) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Strange mix of action, sci-fi and satire about enemies (Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes) who do battle thirty-six years after they were genetically frozen. In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is. Snipes clearly steals the film as the sadistic bad guy who will kill anyone who gets in his way. The blonde hair and silly outfit actually manages to look cool with the actor turning in a very fun performance. Stallone is also quite good here and makes for a good hero to go against Snipes. Sandra Bullock gives such a weird and perhaps bad performance that it still comes off rather charming in a bizarre way. Denis Leary is good in his few scenes as are Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. The action scenes are actually pretty good here but these too take a backseat to the various forms of comedy. Again, some of the comedy works but some of it just gets beaten to death and this includes all the cussing fines, which are constantly going off throughout the entire film. The first few times this joke is used it's actually funny but they just run it into the ground. I'd also say the film probably would have benefited from around ten-minutes being cut out. Still, the film is manages to be fun enough to where fans of the stars will want to check it out.

    Demolition Man imagined a future based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots getting worse, and how society would have degenerated from there. This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security. The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs. Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed. It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

    This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were.

It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.

    Demolition Man (1993) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Strange mix of action, sci-fi and satire about enemies (Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes) who do battle thirty-six years after they were genetically frozen. In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is. Snipes clearly steals the film as the sadistic bad guy who will kill anyone who gets in his way. The blonde hair and silly outfit actually manages to look cool with the actor turning in a very fun performance. Stallone is also quite good here and makes for a good hero to go against Snipes. Sandra Bullock gives such a weird and perhaps bad performance that it still comes off rather charming in a bizarre way. Denis Leary is good in his few scenes as are Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. The action scenes are actually pretty good here but these too take a backseat to the various forms of comedy. Again, some of the comedy works but some of it just gets beaten to death and this includes all the cussing fines, which are constantly going off throughout the entire film. The first few times this joke is used it's actually funny but they just run it into the ground. I'd also say the film probably would have benefited from around ten-minutes being cut out. Still, the film is manages to be fun enough to where fans of the stars will want to check it out.

    Demolition Man imagined a future based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots getting worse, and how society would have degenerated from there. This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security. The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs. Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed. It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

    This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright.

Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.

    Demolition Man (1993) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Strange mix of action, sci-fi and satire about enemies (Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes) who do battle thirty-six years after they were genetically frozen. In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is. Snipes clearly steals the film as the sadistic bad guy who will kill anyone who gets in his way. The blonde hair and silly outfit actually manages to look cool with the actor turning in a very fun performance. Stallone is also quite good here and makes for a good hero to go against Snipes. Sandra Bullock gives such a weird and perhaps bad performance that it still comes off rather charming in a bizarre way. Denis Leary is good in his few scenes as are Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. The action scenes are actually pretty good here but these too take a backseat to the various forms of comedy. Again, some of the comedy works but some of it just gets beaten to death and this includes all the cussing fines, which are constantly going off throughout the entire film. The first few times this joke is used it's actually funny but they just run it into the ground. I'd also say the film probably would have benefited from around ten-minutes being cut out. Still, the film is manages to be fun enough to where fans of the stars will want to check it out.

    Demolition Man imagined a future based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots getting worse, and how society would have degenerated from there. This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security. The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs. Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed. It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us.

I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass. Wesley Snipes has played better, but still, he's funny, and really gives us a nice run for our money. This is an excellent light action flick, you won't be disappointed.

    I remember seeing 'Demolition Man' for the first time in mid 90's when it came out on VHS. It was a huge deal then, fast paced, loaded with special effects...After watching this today, I have very mixed feelings. It's not a horrible movie by any means but It's also very, very far from the top. Sly Stallone gives a decent 'tough guy' performance, he used to deliver way better acting now and then but he's fine and he has a few nice on liners and Schwarzenegger joke rocks. Unfortunately he's the only one decent here. Wesley Snipes does his 'black gangsta' routine but he's not believable at all. Just a big, black guy who tries to be funny and scary all the time, but he's just too weak actor to deliver serious performance. Sandra Bullock has very little to work with here, she's more of an eye candy than actress in this movie. Special effects look dated in many scenes which is not a good thing when you know it was $57 mi lion dollar movie. All in all - It's obviously watchable film but I would say, one of Sly's worst entries and almost two hours? Way too long for such a movie.

    This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent "fish out of water". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a "more than just" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.

    This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy. Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans. Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters. The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    3/10 1 cus there's no zero 2 for the agreeable theories, ie the cops cannot handle confrontation. 3 for the fun watching it :-) Most 90's movies were brainlessly violent, corny and, when it came to future plots, over expectantly inaccurate. Constant references of primativity to a society that was only 40 years prior to the plot. Waiting for somebody to swear or curse "EEEEEEEHH! You are fined one credit..." Ridiculous inaccuracies in the timeline predictions. Bad guys OTT quirkiness. Typical 90's action flick one liners and comebacks. Why did they turn off the swearing thingy half way through? That just made the movie boring from that point onward. Anyway, as another reviewer said, it's a fun movie if you don't take it seriously

    This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a "pre-comic" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.

    Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait. 2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power. Sure, it's not a political pamphlet but at last, it's said and kids watching it can have a lot to ponder. Not bad!

    'Demolition Man' is A Good Action Flick. It works as a escapist entertainer & passes your time efficiently. Also, the fight-sequences, between Screen-Hero Sylvester Stallone & Screen-Villain Wesley Snipes, are terrific. 'Demolition Man' Synopsis: A cop is brought out of suspended animation in prison to pursue an old ultra-violent enemy who is loose in a nonviolent future society. 'Demolition Man' is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a kinda film, that remains as a popcorn entertainer, that works only till it lasts. It is entertaining for sure, but not really memorable. Screenplay by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lenkov, is escapist, yet fun. Marco Brambilla's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Action-Sequences are terrific. Performance-Wise: Stallone & Snipes shine in their respective parts. Stallone plays the hero with great energy, while Snipes rips it up as the wicked villain. Sandra Bullock is cute. Nigel Hawthorne supports well. Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider & Jesse Ventura, are noticeable. On the whole, 'Demolition Man' is a good entertainer.
