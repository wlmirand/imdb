    Political issues are a common theme in John Sayles's movies, and "Men with Guns" is one of the most significant. Set in an unnamed Latin American country, Dr. Humberto Fuentes (Federico Luppi) has lived a privileged life and trained his students to tend to people out in the countryside. To be certain, Fuentes has never had any strong political convictions. But when he learns that his students have gotten murdered, he goes to investigate. He learns that the "men with guns" have been indiscriminately murdering the peasant population. The "men with guns" are any people who carry weapons: soldiers, rebels, or otherwise. The point is that to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, there's practically no difference between government troops and rebels. The movie has many qualities that make one forget that it's American-made. Aside from the mostly Latin American cast -- Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody play a pair of American tourists who are completely ignorant of the local culture -- the movie incorporates magical realism into its plot. Also, while most of the dialog is in Spanish, some scenes show people speaking Mayan, Kuna, Nahuatl and Tzotzil. But the movie's basic gist (Dr. Fuentes's eventual search for a village that has escaped the bloodshed) is summed up by a repeated line: "It's good to go where there are no white people." This is definitely one that I recommend.

    "The mediocre movie explains everything twice and always means exactly what it says. It waves its sincerity aloft like a truce flag. It leaves no questions unanswered. It tells you exactly where you should stand in relation to its characters and its subject matter. It is frequently soothing because it tells you that you are right. But it tends not to stick in the memory because there's nothing there to wonder about." - Vincent Canby Set in an unnamed Latin American country, "Men With Guns" revolves around Dr Fuentes, an ageing physician who once trained a group of students to provide health care for poverty-stricken citizens who live in remote agricultural communities. When he hears rumours that his former students are dead or dying, Fuentes bravely attempts to investigate. What follows is a tale akin to Conrad's "Hearts of Darkness", in which the doctor ventures deeper and deeper into the countryside, until he comes face to face with the "men with guns"; military and guerrilla forces who terrorise peasants. Like most of director John Sayles' films, "Men With Guns" is a quasi-Marxist tract (Marxism, at its best, is far more radical) about working class struggle. Here, though, Sayles attempts to depict feudalism as just another hierarchal market system (and vice versa). And rather than the tone of angry resistance which coloured his earlier films, Sayles adopts instead a tone of almost total futility. As our hero travels further into the countryside he grows more and more disillusioned, the disconnect (and also, the implicit connection) between his cosy middle classy city life and the violent peasantry becoming increasingly unbearable. Indeed, the different peasants Dr Fuentes encounters all demonstrate themselves to be completely resolved to their fates. They identify themselves as gum people, coffee people, banana people, history having long conditioned them into accepting subservience. 7.5/10  Though well meaning, and though its message is positively vital, this is an overlong, aesthetically plain and badly paced film, lacking the nuances of Sayles' best work. The film's final 20 minutes elevate things somewhat. Worth one viewing.

    I saw this film once, on cable, completely unaware of who John Sayles was, and initially unsure if I wanted to watch something which sounded so didactic, but what I found was one of the most compelling dramas I had ever seen. The story follows a wealthy doctor from a lush unnamed city in a fictional South American country(but its filmed in Mexico), on his journey through the country side, as part of his retirement, he is going to first visit those doctors whom he trained that went on to work in poor villages. Out of the comfort of the city comes the violence of rural areas, crimes and horrors perpetrated not by the government or the rebels, but in the eyes of the many villagers who recount the tales, by "The Men With Guns". A journey of disillusionment and story of complacency, action, and meaning, "Men With Guns" is a movie which doesn't seem particularly appealing but which side-winds viewers with it's surprising literate dialog and plotting and lush visuals of South American countryside. Men With Guns is a political allegory that sneaks up on you with it's emotional impact and gripping humanism. I don't normally like to use to the word "moving" when referring to a work of art, because it makes me think of heavy lifting and boxes, but this movie was just, that, and having only seen it once after many years, it still comes back to me, particularly when I hear the daily body counts from any of the numerous war zones, patronized by the night news.

    Others have said it better, so I'll just second the positive comments. The film is a little uneven in parts, but it's a moving story which will stay with you much longer than some CGI-laden summer confection. The priest's ghost story, for example, would be a powerful short film all on its own. Sayles has a heart and would probably be making movies even if he hadn't managed the relatively modest (in comparison to his talent) success he's achieved so far. -- "There is no other definition of socialism valid for us than that of the abolition of the exploitation of man by man." - Ernesto "Che" Guevara

    i rented this over 8 years ago, and whenever anyone asks me for movie recommendations, this film always comes to mind. don't let the dreamlike atmosphere fool you, this film is depressing and haunting because of the main message: that innocence and idealism will be forever trampled by the "men with guns" despite all their good intentions. In this film the government and rebel groups were portrayed as equivalently bad by the simple folk caught in the middle. they (the equivalent of civilians) did not distinguish between the soldiers and the revolutionaries, they simply referred to them as the "men with guns". its a persuasive case for nonviolence. it takes all the glorification out of war, conflict and political movements and glorifies a simpler more humane way of living.

    Interesting movie which takes a stuffy, arrogant, wealthy, elderly doctor on a sobering vacation where he realizes that his lifetime of idealism has been misplaced, and that he leaves behind a legacy of nothing. The cynicism of his wealthy family as they have dinner with him before he embarks on his trip contrasts with the harsh reality of poverty that the doctor encounters as he searches for the graduate class of medical students that he had personally trained and sent into the mountainous regions to help the poor. Unfortunately, during the whole movie, the doctor is primarily interested in finding his former medical students because they are his "legacy." At no point does he even discuss these former students as if they meant anything to him as people. The doctor seems very emotionally detached from others, and he is not a very likable person. Even at the end of his journey, the doctor never warms up to the people that have guided him through the mountains, and never shows any interest in the future of the little boy. While the doctor often shows some basic human compassion, he clearly represents a stereotype of a rich white member of the power structure inside the world of the Indian peasants. As such, the doctor is only concerned with his personal legacy as a doctor, and really shows little interest in the welfare of the indigenous people. The film's best moments are the comic exchanges between the stereotypical peasants. In this sense, the film is not much different from hundreds of westerns since the 1930s. The appearance of Mandy Patinkin as a recurring American tourist who also provides comic relief is a bit forced. Apparently the American tourists are in the film to provide small stretches of English language dialogue, as the rest of the movie is in Spanish. Those scenes could easily have been deleted out of the movie. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, and it is also very heavy handed. The doctor comes to the conclusion that the legacy of his life was nothing, and that he was a complete failure. Then he has a heart attack and dies as he is laying against a tree. So one of the bandidos, the former Army medic; picks up his medical bag when a peasant girl asks if he can help her mother (who has a nasty rash on her legs). The message being that the peasants are the only ones who can help each other if they are given a chance? The old doctor should have gone into the forest and trained peasants instead of sending in all his rich medical students? Bandidos make better doctors? Elderly doctors should not go hiking in the woods? Peasants are funnier than rich people?

    Once again screenwriter/director John Sayles has done it. I was flipping through the channels, and saw a movie in Spanish. I am a Spanish major so whenever a chance to listen to some dialog comes along, I usually will listen for a few minutes just for practice. I became totally engrossed. I hit the info button on my DVR to see the name of the movie. I was on IFC channel & it said it was a movie about hoodlums. Uh, no... There was another movie same year same name that I've no doubt wasn't anywhere near as wonderful as this one. So I paused the DVR at the end & looked up Federico Luppi & crossed referenced it with Dami&aacute;n Delgado to find the real name of the movie. Which turned out to be this one. Enough of how I found it... This is another great example of supreme storytelling by John Sayles. Anyone who has seen Lone Star or Passion Fish knows that he is a storyteller extraordinaire. Not to mention he usually manages to throw in some meaning. Another reviewer complained that there was meaning. Weird... I don't see anything wrong with that. Isn't that what most of us are searching for? In this story Dr. Fuentes is in an unidentified South American country that has been ripped apart by war and guerillas. He is searching for his students, doctors who were trying to help the indigenous population through medicine. He finds wherever he goes that his students are dead or missing. Along the way he encounters a boy with no family that becomes his "mascot" and later a deserter from the army with a hideous past. Then a priest who has lost faith, then a young girl who is mute. Each person has a story to tell, each person a part of the puzzle of what it is to be human and alive. I loved the ending, because it showed that even when we think our lives have been pointless, we have like the concentric ripples in a lake after a stone is dropped, affected those around us. Our legacy lives on through the lives we have touched, whether we know it or not. I think that we think there should be some kind of concrete evidence that WE can measure to define our legacy, but it is never what we think it is, there is mystery, magic in the way that our lives mingle and combine to form meaning. Much like in "It's a Wonderful Life," even if you think you've contributed nothing it's not true. Or in the words of the immortal Whitman: "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless- of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life? Answer: That you are here- that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse." (from Whitman's Leaves of Grass) What this movie says is just that- that each person's verse, identity contributes to the great scheme of things. I won't give away the ending of the movie, but the whole thing is just a grand example of a good story. Don't be bothered by the subtitles, it's a great movie in any language. And btw, the subtitles were pretty much right on. I just hate when I watch a subtitled movie & the translation sucks or is lacking. This is a great story, interesting people, good pacing (also directed by Sayles), and good acting too. I wish that more people could see this movie. God bless the Independent Film Channel. :)

    Interesting look at how a country torn by revolt affects the plans of a doctor searching for several former students. He has many adventures as he goes deeper into the frenzied bowels of his country. Most of his experiences are negative as he discovers that his rose colored view of home isn't based on reality. A sobering ending put just the right touch to this vividly ugly picture.

    I loved Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness and I loved Apocalypse Now, so it shouldn't be at all surprising that I loved Men With Guns. Like Apocalpyse, Sayles also uses humor to provide needed contrast and relief from what would otherwise be a very depressing story. As directed, the movie is sobering and quite funny at the same time, the characters are very interesting, and the overall effect is highly entertaining.

    I loved Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness and I loved Apocalypse Now, so it shouldn't be at all surprising that I loved Men With Guns. Like Apocalpyse, Sayles also uses humor to provide needed contrast and relief from what would otherwise be a very depressing story. As directed, the movie is sobering and quite funny at the same time, the characters are very interesting, and the overall effect is highly entertaining.

    This movie has some of the most expertly drawn characters I've ever seen in a movie. The acting and writing is absolutely superb. The ending is uplifting, but not sappy or overly sentimental. It's the type of movie that can be watched again and again.

    Political issues are a common theme in John Sayles's movies, and "Men with Guns" is one of the most significant. Set in an unnamed Latin American country, Dr. Humberto Fuentes (Federico Luppi) has lived a privileged life and trained his students to tend to people out in the countryside. To be certain, Fuentes has never had any strong political convictions. But when he learns that his students have gotten murdered, he goes to investigate. He learns that the "men with guns" have been indiscriminately murdering the peasant population. The "men with guns" are any people who carry weapons: soldiers, rebels, or otherwise. The point is that to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, there's practically no difference between government troops and rebels. The movie has many qualities that make one forget that it's American-made. Aside from the mostly Latin American cast -- Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody play a pair of American tourists who are completely ignorant of the local culture -- the movie incorporates magical realism into its plot. Also, while most of the dialog is in Spanish, some scenes show people speaking Mayan, Kuna, Nahuatl and Tzotzil. But the movie's basic gist (Dr. Fuentes's eventual search for a village that has escaped the bloodshed) is summed up by a repeated line: "It's good to go where there are no white people." This is definitely one that I recommend.

    "The mediocre movie explains everything twice and always means exactly what it says. It waves its sincerity aloft like a truce flag. It leaves no questions unanswered. It tells you exactly where you should stand in relation to its characters and its subject matter. It is frequently soothing because it tells you that you are right. But it tends not to stick in the memory because there's nothing there to wonder about." - Vincent Canby Set in an unnamed Latin American country, "Men With Guns" revolves around Dr Fuentes, an ageing physician who once trained a group of students to provide health care for poverty-stricken citizens who live in remote agricultural communities. When he hears rumours that his former students are dead or dying, Fuentes bravely attempts to investigate. What follows is a tale akin to Conrad's "Hearts of Darkness", in which the doctor ventures deeper and deeper into the countryside, until he comes face to face with the "men with guns"; military and guerrilla forces who terrorise peasants. Like most of director John Sayles' films, "Men With Guns" is a quasi-Marxist tract (Marxism, at its best, is far more radical) about working class struggle. Here, though, Sayles attempts to depict feudalism as just another hierarchal market system (and vice versa). And rather than the tone of angry resistance which coloured his earlier films, Sayles adopts instead a tone of almost total futility. As our hero travels further into the countryside he grows more and more disillusioned, the disconnect (and also, the implicit connection) between his cosy middle classy city life and the violent peasantry becoming increasingly unbearable. Indeed, the different peasants Dr Fuentes encounters all demonstrate themselves to be completely resolved to their fates. They identify themselves as gum people, coffee people, banana people, history having long conditioned them into accepting subservience. 7.5/10  Though well meaning, and though its message is positively vital, this is an overlong, aesthetically plain and badly paced film, lacking the nuances of Sayles' best work. The film's final 20 minutes elevate things somewhat. Worth one viewing.

    I saw this film once, on cable, completely unaware of who John Sayles was, and initially unsure if I wanted to watch something which sounded so didactic, but what I found was one of the most compelling dramas I had ever seen. The story follows a wealthy doctor from a lush unnamed city in a fictional South American country(but its filmed in Mexico), on his journey through the country side, as part of his retirement, he is going to first visit those doctors whom he trained that went on to work in poor villages. Out of the comfort of the city comes the violence of rural areas, crimes and horrors perpetrated not by the government or the rebels, but in the eyes of the many villagers who recount the tales, by "The Men With Guns". A journey of disillusionment and story of complacency, action, and meaning, "Men With Guns" is a movie which doesn't seem particularly appealing but which side-winds viewers with it's surprising literate dialog and plotting and lush visuals of South American countryside. Men With Guns is a political allegory that sneaks up on you with it's emotional impact and gripping humanism. I don't normally like to use to the word "moving" when referring to a work of art, because it makes me think of heavy lifting and boxes, but this movie was just, that, and having only seen it once after many years, it still comes back to me, particularly when I hear the daily body counts from any of the numerous war zones, patronized by the night news.

    Others have said it better, so I'll just second the positive comments. The film is a little uneven in parts, but it's a moving story which will stay with you much longer than some CGI-laden summer confection. The priest's ghost story, for example, would be a powerful short film all on its own. Sayles has a heart and would probably be making movies even if he hadn't managed the relatively modest (in comparison to his talent) success he's achieved so far. -- "There is no other definition of socialism valid for us than that of the abolition of the exploitation of man by man." - Ernesto "Che" Guevara

    i rented this over 8 years ago, and whenever anyone asks me for movie recommendations, this film always comes to mind. don't let the dreamlike atmosphere fool you, this film is depressing and haunting because of the main message: that innocence and idealism will be forever trampled by the "men with guns" despite all their good intentions. In this film the government and rebel groups were portrayed as equivalently bad by the simple folk caught in the middle. they (the equivalent of civilians) did not distinguish between the soldiers and the revolutionaries, they simply referred to them as the "men with guns". its a persuasive case for nonviolence. it takes all the glorification out of war, conflict and political movements and glorifies a simpler more humane way of living.

    Interesting movie which takes a stuffy, arrogant, wealthy, elderly doctor on a sobering vacation where he realizes that his lifetime of idealism has been misplaced, and that he leaves behind a legacy of nothing. The cynicism of his wealthy family as they have dinner with him before he embarks on his trip contrasts with the harsh reality of poverty that the doctor encounters as he searches for the graduate class of medical students that he had personally trained and sent into the mountainous regions to help the poor. Unfortunately, during the whole movie, the doctor is primarily interested in finding his former medical students because they are his "legacy." At no point does he even discuss these former students as if they meant anything to him as people. The doctor seems very emotionally detached from others, and he is not a very likable person. Even at the end of his journey, the doctor never warms up to the people that have guided him through the mountains, and never shows any interest in the future of the little boy. While the doctor often shows some basic human compassion, he clearly represents a stereotype of a rich white member of the power structure inside the world of the Indian peasants. As such, the doctor is only concerned with his personal legacy as a doctor, and really shows little interest in the welfare of the indigenous people. The film's best moments are the comic exchanges between the stereotypical peasants. In this sense, the film is not much different from hundreds of westerns since the 1930s. The appearance of Mandy Patinkin as a recurring American tourist who also provides comic relief is a bit forced. Apparently the American tourists are in the film to provide small stretches of English language dialogue, as the rest of the movie is in Spanish. Those scenes could easily have been deleted out of the movie. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, and it is also very heavy handed. The doctor comes to the conclusion that the legacy of his life was nothing, and that he was a complete failure. Then he has a heart attack and dies as he is laying against a tree. So one of the bandidos, the former Army medic; picks up his medical bag when a peasant girl asks if he can help her mother (who has a nasty rash on her legs). The message being that the peasants are the only ones who can help each other if they are given a chance? The old doctor should have gone into the forest and trained peasants instead of sending in all his rich medical students? Bandidos make better doctors? Elderly doctors should not go hiking in the woods? Peasants are funnier than rich people?

    Once again screenwriter/director John Sayles has done it. I was flipping through the channels, and saw a movie in Spanish. I am a Spanish major so whenever a chance to listen to some dialog comes along, I usually will listen for a few minutes just for practice. I became totally engrossed. I hit the info button on my DVR to see the name of the movie. I was on IFC channel & it said it was a movie about hoodlums. Uh, no... There was another movie same year same name that I've no doubt wasn't anywhere near as wonderful as this one. So I paused the DVR at the end & looked up Federico Luppi & crossed referenced it with Dami&aacute;n Delgado to find the real name of the movie. Which turned out to be this one. Enough of how I found it... This is another great example of supreme storytelling by John Sayles. Anyone who has seen Lone Star or Passion Fish knows that he is a storyteller extraordinaire. Not to mention he usually manages to throw in some meaning. Another reviewer complained that there was meaning. Weird... I don't see anything wrong with that. Isn't that what most of us are searching for? In this story Dr. Fuentes is in an unidentified South American country that has been ripped apart by war and guerillas. He is searching for his students, doctors who were trying to help the indigenous population through medicine. He finds wherever he goes that his students are dead or missing. Along the way he encounters a boy with no family that becomes his "mascot" and later a deserter from the army with a hideous past. Then a priest who has lost faith, then a young girl who is mute. Each person has a story to tell, each person a part of the puzzle of what it is to be human and alive. I loved the ending, because it showed that even when we think our lives have been pointless, we have like the concentric ripples in a lake after a stone is dropped, affected those around us. Our legacy lives on through the lives we have touched, whether we know it or not. I think that we think there should be some kind of concrete evidence that WE can measure to define our legacy, but it is never what we think it is, there is mystery, magic in the way that our lives mingle and combine to form meaning. Much like in "It's a Wonderful Life," even if you think you've contributed nothing it's not true. Or in the words of the immortal Whitman: "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless- of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life? Answer: That you are here- that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse." (from Whitman's Leaves of Grass) What this movie says is just that- that each person's verse, identity contributes to the great scheme of things. I won't give away the ending of the movie, but the whole thing is just a grand example of a good story. Don't be bothered by the subtitles, it's a great movie in any language. And btw, the subtitles were pretty much right on. I just hate when I watch a subtitled movie & the translation sucks or is lacking. This is a great story, interesting people, good pacing (also directed by Sayles), and good acting too. I wish that more people could see this movie. God bless the Independent Film Channel. :)

    Interesting look at how a country torn by revolt affects the plans of a doctor searching for several former students. He has many adventures as he goes deeper into the frenzied bowels of his country. Most of his experiences are negative as he discovers that his rose colored view of home isn't based on reality. A sobering ending put just the right touch to this vividly ugly picture.
