 <sinopse>
  With the help of a smooth talking tomcat, a family of Parisian felines set to inherit a fortune from their owner try to make it back home after a jealous butler kidnaps them and leaves them in the country.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Retired madame Adelaide Bonfamille enjoys the good life in her Paris villa with even classier cat Duchess and three kittens: pianist Berlioz, painter Toulouse and sanctimonious Marie. When loyal butler Edgar overhears her will leaves everything to the cats until their death, he drugs and kidnaps them. However retired army dogs make his sidecar capsize on the country. Crafty stray cat Thomas O'Malley takes them under his wing back to Paris. Edgar tries to cover his tracks and catch them at return, but more animals turn on him, from the cart horse Frou-Frou to the tame mouse Roquefort and O'Malley's jazz friends.

    I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult. Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    THE ARISTOCATS This film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst. The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones. There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny. Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh. I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh. The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst. This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

    When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the "classic" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".

So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst.

Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

    When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the "classic" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".

    I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult. Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    THE ARISTOCATS This film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst. The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones. There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny. Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh. I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh. The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst. This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny.

The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    THE ARISTOCATS This film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst. The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones. There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny. Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh. I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh. The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst. This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

    When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the "classic" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".

    I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult. Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

    When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the "classic" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".

    I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult. Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    THE ARISTOCATS This film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst. The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones. There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny. Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh. I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh. The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst. This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    THE ARISTOCATS This film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst. The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley. At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones. There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny. Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh. I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh. The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it. It felt like it was missing some of the Disney magic that is critical in a Disney Classic.

    In 1910 Paris, a cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) lives comfortably in a mansion with her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and her wealthy owner Madame Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer. Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst. This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters. Yet the similarities to other, better Disney classics damage the film, and apart from the beautiful, hand-drawn animation and top-tapping tunes, The Aristocats struggles to stand out. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the "Dark Era". The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on. This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for "Everybody Wants to be A Cat", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and "Scales and Appegios" is a cute song. Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst. With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

    When it comes to Disney animation, everybody has one favourite, and while often that boils down to the "classic" films like Bambi or Snow White, mine's from a later era: Aristocats, the best of Wolfgang Reitherman's works for Disney in my opinion. He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".

    I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult. Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, "straight from the horse's mouth" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens. Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.

    The Aristocrats is Disney's 20th Animated Disney Cannon from the House Of Mouse and tells the tale of a d&eacute;butante who pretty well off as she has a cat called Duchess(voiced by Eva Gabor)who goes missing along with her three kittens as their owner's evil butler wants to dispose of them so that he can get the money(yeah you could say he is related to Cruella De Vil in a way). Along the way and Duchess meets a charming ladies man called Thomas O Malley(Phil Harris who I think voiced Babloo in The Jungle Book back in 1966 the year Walt Disney died)an alley cat who stumbles across Duchess and her three kittens and together the three go back to Paris to find Duchess's owner again. So do I like this movie; well the music is pretty similar to the 2009 49th Animated flick The Princess & The Frog which has jazz music too but that was set in 1920s New Orleans,The Aristocrats was set in Paris 1910(yeah JAZZ music in Paris; I had no idea that Jazz music was in Paris France till this came out).Overall I found this movie to be good. Is it the best animated movie of all time NO,but is it a timeless classic YES it is,but its not my personal favourite. So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. The music: 4/5 The Plot: 3/5 (cause it reminded me of the cat version of Lady & The Tramp). Voice Acting: 4/5

    Three years after the gigantic hit "The Jungle Book", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called "The Aristocats".

An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home. The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy.

    This is apparently the last film project to be approved by Mr. Walt Disney and I think he would have been proud of it because even after his death they knew how to remain faithful to his style. This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with "Uncle Walt". The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money. Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience. Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious. Uncle Waldo is unquestionably one of the most hilarious characters  despite his short role, he is such a delight. Roquefort (the mouse) and Frou Frou (the horse) are funny in their own way. The movie has high-quality artwork, originality, great lines and delightful voices from the acting business such as Roddy Maude-Roxby, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Charles Lane, Sterling Holloway, Vitto Scotti, Paul Winchell, Pat Buttram, Bill Thompson and Thurl Ravenscroft. Title in Portugal: 'Os Aristogatos'.

He did other enjoyable films like "Jungle Book", "101 Dalmatians" or "Robin Hood", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in "Lady and the Tramp" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!

    The AristoCats (1970) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another charming winner from Disney about a mother cat and her three kittens who are kidnapped and placed in the country when the butler realizes that their rich owner has left her fortune the felines and not him. Out in the country the cats come across another one known as O'Malley who plans to help them get back to their owner. THE ARISTOCATS is without question a very fun, action packed and all around good time. This here is certainly the studio at their very best as we get just about everything that one could hope for. I think what makes this film so successful are the characters and their vocal performers. I really thought the O'Malley cat was a terrific character and certainly the most memorable in the picture. I really loved his street toughness and actor Phil Harris did a tremendous job at bringing him to life. The character is just so charming that you can't help but love him. The same is true for the mother Duchess and the vocal work by Eva Gabor. Scatman Crothers is also very memorable in his role as Scat Cat. The songs 'Thomas O'Malley Cat' and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' are both extremely entertaining as well. The animation is wonderful, as you'd expect, and the film has a very fast pace thanks to the wonderful little adventure that the cats are on.

    I got this one on Blu-ray from my public library. It is entertaining fluff, essentially a series of cartoon-like scenes to support the central story of a family of aristocratic cats in a wealthy Paris family. It was good to hear the familiar voices of such old-time stars as Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Scatman Crothers, and ventriloquist Paul Winchell. The family of cats live with their elderly owner who is re-writing her will. The old faithful butler overhears part of the conversation with her lawyer, on her death the whole estate will go to her cats, and after they die then the butler will inherit everything. The butler cannot stand the thought of waiting 12 years for them to die, plus their "nine lives", so this being a Disney movie, he plots to have them disappear to the countryside, and then he will be the sole heir. Most of the movie is their road trip of sorts, assisted by a nice male alley cat, back to Paris and their mansion. Along the way they get into a number of close calls. Meanwhile the butler has to go back to the drop point to retrieve his hat and umbrella, clues that could lead the police to him. Fun to see this "blast from the past".
