    It's interesting that when this film was released in 1993 that the prominent scene shown in film review shows is the scene where the South Vietnamese Army enter the village of Le Ly and come under attack by the VC . This gives the impression you're going to be watching a Vietnam film and the early part of the film does concentrate on the history of Vietnam . Too much so because if you do have a rough outline of Vietnamese history then you'll find the main story is being held up by Le Ly's potted history of Vietnam at every opportunity . There is a train of thought that if a film is too reliant on voice over then the film is failing on that level and this may well be a case in point That's not the only flaw . The way everything is shot gives an idealised view of a far off exotic land . If the Vietnamese government want to do a plug for visiting Vietnam then director Oliver Stone has done the country a big favour . There's a war on don't you and no matter what Le Ly's village still manages to look like a Utopian destination and despite people getting frequently killed and raped one wonders why on Earth anyone would want to leave here . Indeed the cynic in me wonders if Stone is seeking a personal redemption by making this film . I know Stone volunteered for military service in Vietnam and I know prior to that he volunteered to be an English language teacher in Vietnam but yet I never felt I was watching a real world view of Vietnam , more of a clich&eacute;d Lonely Planet romanticised Westerner view of the country There's also another flaw and that is Stone seems obsessed with Eastern mysticism . Heaven and Earth ? Ying and Yang ? Slumdog non millionaire and other new age nonsense as Stone concentrates on Karma and other metaphysical nonsense . The Vietnam war came about via Cold War politics and had nothing to do with nature or anything else outside of human engineered power struggles . Stone wants us to believe that a spiritual force is controlling everything but I'm afraid I'm more likely to listen to historians and scientists rather than soothsayers . The main flaw of the movie is that the story is ugly but the visuals are beautiful and while the audience can understand the point Stone is making via this technique it doesn't make new age thinking anymore credible

    To me, this and JFK are the best movies from director Oliver Stone, but the two are world apart as far as the movie goes. First the backdrop of each scene of this movie makes you yearn for somewhere to go home to. Then you see the tanks, the soldiers, and of course the war shows that home is being ravaged into a place where you can't go any more. I actually feel being torn away from the place of my heart, and I'm not even Vietnamese. So I'd say the visual impact of this movie is high. South Viet Nam was a relatively wealthy country in Southeast Asia because they had the perfect climate for growing rice and crops, but just because of the war, you see people becoming destitute. The way the story and the visuals comes together in this movie is one of the best I've seen. It really provokes something in the heart. I've never had a movie experience like this before or since I've seen this movie. The only negative I can see is the poor quality of Asian female actors. Except for Hiep who played the lead role, everyone else was bad to the point of being painful to watch. If a movie is supposed to tell the story and give the simulated experience of the people who are in the story, this is without a doubt one of the best movie I've ever seen.

    Heaven and Earth (1993) follows Platoon (1986) and Born of the Fourth of July (1989) to conclude director Oliver Stone's Vietnam War trilogy. Where Stone won Best Director Oscars for both previous films, Heaven and Earth proved a box-office disaster and went unrecognized by the Academy, though Kitaro bagged a Golden Globe for his haunting score. It's hard not to suspect that racism underlay the commercial failure, for where the hit movies addressed the sufferings of white American soldiers played by Hollywood stars, Heaven and Earth focused on the fundamental victims, adapting the true story of a young Vietnamese woman, Le Ly, who goes from village girl to freedom fighter to wife of a US marine struggling to adjust to life in America to reconciliation in Vietnam. Superbly made, with a stunning performance by Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly, and powerful support from Tommy Lee Jones, this is intelligent, harrowing film-making that attempts to understand and bridge the divide between nations traumatized by war.

    The third of Oliver Stone's trilogy on the Vietnam war, is also the least known of the three. However, that does not reflect on its quality in any way. I found this as compelling, if not more, a portrait of the effects of war on the human psyche. The story is based on the true life memoirs of Le Ly Hayslip, a woman caught in a Vietnamese village during the Vietnam war, and who later flourished in the US. While, some of the characters may have been fictional, by and large it seems to be a faithful adaptation. The cinematography in the village (supposed to be Vietnam, but I heard is Thailand) is breathtakingly beautiful, and I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to see this on the big screen. The movie follows the life of Le Ly, as she grows up in a peaceful village in Vietnam, farming with her parents and siblings. Life seems idyllic till the VietCong appear. Their propaganda against the government influences some of the villagers to support them. Eventually the government forces come and start taking away villagers for questioning (torture). One such day, Le Ly is taken away. The sequences depicting the torture are pretty graphic and not for the faint of heart. Eventually, after she is released, she makes her way to the city with her mother, and her story continues, eventually ending up with meeting a marine, Steve Butler (Tommy Lee Jones, who makes his appearance after an hour into the movie) and flying to the US. The story quite beautifully captures the effect the war has on different individuals, including an amazing transformation in the character of Steve Butler, as he is tormented in the USA by images of the war and by his own failures afterwards. The acting is very good mostly, including a brilliant turn by Haing S. Ngor, who shot to prominence with his role in 'The Killing Fields'. The story eventually manages to capture the spirit of this lady, who overcame some bitter hardships in life.

    Stone looks objectively at the spiritual way of life led by a Vietnamese village, how they mind immaterial happiness to be able to survive the misery of their corporeal lives. The film begins as an exposition of the village, then begins to focus on one of its resident families, and all the while slowly tightens more and more into a study of one of the daughters, an impassioned girl named Le Ly, whose view of life is not much different than that of the rest of her family but embodies the journey that affirms the importance of their spiritual experience. She is born into a babe-in-the-woods atmosphere, in which her village lives as they have for centuries. All is in its place like the ancestors who are buried on land that has been in the same family for so long. Then a warplane screams across the sky, and in a heartbeat all she knows is sieged. What she believes to be her fate will take her from the rice patties of the Central Highlands to the sprawling bubble of California. Oliver Stone has made films about Vietnam from the point of view of a combat infantryman and a paralyzed veteran, and now in this unsung gem he punctuates an indispensable installment into a trilogy by seeing the war through the eyes of a Vietnamese woman. The story is true, as were Platoon, drawn from his own first-hand experience, and Born on the Fourth of July, based on the autobiography of Ron Kovic. I feel safe in saying that the seminal spirituality of this film is objective, and vitally so, because there are many things about this film that seem externally uncharacteristic of Stone's body of work. For instance, he is not known for films about women. This is the first time he has had to place himself inside a woman's thoughts, and that he indiscriminately does owes no small piece to Hiep Thi Le's performance in the leading role. Having been born in Vietnam, come to America as a child, knowing both worlds, is perfectly cast for such a culturally and realistically complicated character to portray. Seeing the war through her eyes, watching as foreign troops beeline across the fields of her family, we are asked by Stone to see how radically antagonistic the American strategy in Vietnam was. The long-term aim was to win the "hearts and minds" of the Vietnamese people. With this intent, we displaced them from the land of their ancestors, and shepherded them into "strategic hamlets" made to force the Viet Cong out, even if they worked more like camps to keep the residents in. This strife indeed emboldened them to relate to the Cong, who appreciated their same ideals. For common growers who wanted just to farm, the war brought nightmarish dilemmas. Into her life one day comes a towering, rugged American named Steve Butler, in one of Tommy Lee Jones's becoming, persuasive and mood-swinging performances, who does not want her as a hooker, but as a wife. He is kind, compassionate, determined, yet maybe if she were less hard up she would discern a worrying connotation when he claims, "I want an Oriental wife." His image of her is desperately entwined with his own internal debilitations, his need for a woman who will concurrently absolve him, and submit to him. Le Ly returns to America as Mrs. Steve Butler, to a land where the supermarket shelves seem to sprawl infinitely in all vectors and the in-laws treat her as something between a darling and an embarrassment. One of her American relatives is played, through skillful casting, by Debbie Reynolds. Le Ly has issues adapting, but not as many as her husband, who learns that his groundwork and 20 years as a "military adviser" have left him despairingly unfit for civilian life. Jones shows his talent for characters who are never scarier than when they are simpatico. The anamorphic cinematography by the great Robert Richardson dials up the color palette so that the transition from the horrific chaos in Vietnam and the commodified epic pleasantry of America is almost explosively surreal. We follow Le Ly and her new husband into supermarkets and split-level San Diego kitchens with relentless wide angle lenses and sometimes even the out-of-sync slow motion Stone would soon fall in love with while making Natural Born Killers. Part of what made Stone such a draw in the earlier half of his career and a deterrent in his latter half is that he treasures politically controversial topics. When the Vietnam War was the most vital in contemporary American history, just Stone made it his work as a filmmaker. Movies are a very different course to make a meaningful assertion than one which can be accompanied by explanatory notes. Movies interface in the ways things show, sense, sound. In Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and now Heaven and Earth, Stone has us see through eyes that saw three bases of that atrocity.

    Heaven & Earth (1993) was the final part of Oliver Stone's Viet-Nam Trilogy. The story follows a Vietnamese Peasant girl named Ly Le who's idyllic life in her village is changed forever by a civil war in her country. Both sides deal horrific atrocities against her and the rest of the village. Can Ly Le weather the storm that is the Vietnam War and keep her head up? What will happen to her village as the war gets more violent and brutal on both sides? How far can the human condition be under such extremes and still remain sane? You'll have to find out by watching this harrowing film Heaven & Earth. I really like this movie, Oliver Stone is such a masterful storyteller and the acting, directing and writing kept me on edge throughout the entire film. I have to highly recommend this film. Joan Chen (who still looks hot underneath the make-up), Tommy Lee Jones, Dr. Haing S. Ngor co-star as well. Highly recommended

    This is the third movie in director Olvier Stone's unofficial Vietnam War trilogy after Platoon and Born On The Fourth July. It is the least known of these movies and also the worst of them. Which doesn't mean it's bad, far from it, it's actually pretty good. Like Born On The Fourth Of July (and many other Oliver Stone films), Heaven & Earth is based on a true story, this time around that of Vietnamese humanitarian Phung Thi Le Ly Hayslip. Though the Vietnam War is very much present in this movie, it is less a war movie than the previous two, instead more of a "biography" film. And one of the problems with this movie is that though the main character goes through many ordeals and suffers many hardships, you never really feel for her, connect with her. Or at least I didn't, and often found her to be somewhat annoying. Despite his prominent presence in the posters, Tommy Lee Jones is really more of a secondary character here and only appears about an hour and ten minutes into the movie, as a fictional character that was merged from two separate men in Le Ly Hayslip's life. Oliver Stone does have detractors and his latest films haven't been his strongest, but he's generally accepted as one of the "good" directors in Hollywood. Heaven & Earth isn't his best film, but it's still a very well-made one, with some beautiful shots of Vietnam (actually Thailand) and particularly brilliant scenes in America. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film strongly, but once again, there's still some very good stuff in there, so if you're into Oliver Stone, movies about Vietnam War, or movies in general for that matter, it's a nice one to watch.

    Wow, some people live their lives the same way like robots till their death, but this woman lives her life with so many dramas. Same thing is happening in Iraq now, people here in the US are enjoying their lives to the fullest while so many innocent Iraqi people are suffering with no end. I am surprised that the rating is not too high. The movie "Deer hunter" which was also about Vietname war, it was so slow and boring. If it didn't win some Oscars, I would have stopped watching in the middle of it. This movie is about the same feature length, but this one is much more emotional, and not boring at all. It is another tear-jerking movie. This movie helped me to understand the pain that Vietnamese people suffered during the war. It is very authentic. Those are the common people who just want to make the best out of their lives, they just want to live. It was especially touching when she finally came back to her village, and her brother told her about how he felt throughout the years. She is not a hero, but she is such a brave woman who suffered so much, who almost died. How many of us will ever live a life like hers. In the end, this movie makes all of us to treasure the life that we have now, there are so many people who are living in this world who still don't have the things that we take for granted. Thank you for all those who worked on this great movie.

    The third, and most likely final , film in Oliver Stone's trilogy about the Vietnam war is here. In "Platoon" we learned of the horrors of war through the eyes of new recruit Chris Taylor, "Born on the Fourth of July" covered the story of Vietnam veteran come anti-war activist Ron Kovic, and "Heaven and Earth" finally completes the picture by giving us the Vietnam perspective. Based on two autobiographical novels by Le Ly Hayslip, this high powered drama concerns her struggle for survival in war torn Vietnam, as both the allied forces and the North Vietnamese Army constantly threaten her village with death and destruction. Once again stone has created a thought provoking and disturbing piece of cinema, as we follow young Le through her tragic life from ravaged Vietnam to the United States. Hiep Thi Li is very impressive as Hayslip in her film debut, while Tommy Lee Jones, Haing S. Ngor and Joan Chen are strong in support. The cinematography (Robert Richardson) is quite superb as is the sweeping score (Kitaro). Unfortunately "Heaven and Earth" is not as forceful and powerful as the previous films, but this can be attributed to the fact that it is once again not as focused a work as its predecessors, and also because we've seen it before in Stone's earlier war epics, thus it doesn't have the same shocking effect. However, little else can be faulted in yet another eye opening drama from Oliver Stone. Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - Knox District Centre The final part in Oliver Stone's Vietnam experience is told from the Vietnamese perspective with both compassion and conviction. Based on Le Ly Hayslip's (pronounced Lay Lee) autobiographical books "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places" and "Child of War, Woman of Peace", our director's screenplay tells the heartbreaking story of a young woman's devastating journey through life, from an innocent victim of war, to the troubled wife of a U.S. Marine. Following on from his powerful war epics "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July", Stone has crafted a very different and somehow more emotionally involving drama. A magnificent performance from newcomer Hiep Thi Le brings us close to Le Ly's plight as she is first tortured by the Allies and the V.C., then forced to leave her village and try to survive on the streets of Saigon. Strong support comes from Academy Award winner Dr. Haing S. Ngor, Joan Chen and Tommy Lee Jones. Robert Richardson returns to again bring us some startling images of war, as well as some impacting pictures of western society (one particular wide lens shot of a refrigerator alone manages to put our indulgent, wasteful culture to shame). Kitaro provides a sweeping score and the Art Direction and Set Decoration keep things very authentic. As in "J.F.K.", Oliver Stone has crammed so much into "Heaven and Earth" that it's a lot like trying to cope with "Reader's Digest". Yet, though it starts slowly, Stone shows for a third successive time the evil of war and the way in which it destroys lives, families, villages and entire countries. "Heaven and Earth" is also a sobering reminder of our flamboyant and richly blessed lifestyle, and one that's free of the ravages of war. If you don't object to being bludgeoned with a point of view, then all three of Oliver Stone's Vietnam works come highly recommended. Sunday, October 23, 1994 - Video

    This movie gives a passionate and realistic view of the war. Things that really happened such as army guys trying to bring Vietnamese wives back to American and trying to make it work out. Like others have commented it makes you question who really started this war and for what reasons. Tommy Lee Jones character says it all in that quiet whisper that turns into an ugly argument when he tells his wife his mission is and has always been from the beginning to sell arms to countries such as her country. So it gets you thinking about what war is really about. Obviously the soldiers are trained to follow orders and not think about or question those orders. That would result in discharge. And for many in the war it dragged on for years on end and eventually people realize the pointlessness of it. How can the supposed most powerful nation on earth loose a war? You can break their backs with superior technology but you can't break their spirit. And you can never completely eradicate a poor people from their own country. There will aways be a resistance no matter how small. So you can never really win. It's like the old school yard bully who beats up on all the small guys. But as long as people despise the power and strength of the arrogant and evil bully there will always be resistance until the bully eventually pulls back and his pride injured. This has happened throughout all of history in all the world empires. Why is it we believe we are something different? This movie in someways gets you to think about that. Could it possibly be that we are the ones to blame? That we are where the problems started? But of course no one wants to consider that when it is so much easier to and cowardly to blame other people. That is why this film wasn't as well known and didn't rake in the multi-millions as other more popular Rambo movies.

    Stone looks objectively at the spiritual way of life led by a Vietnamese village, how they mind immaterial happiness to be able to survive the misery of their corporeal lives. The film begins as an exposition of the village, then begins to focus on one of its resident families, and all the while slowly tightens more and more into a study of one of the daughters, an impassioned girl named Le Ly, whose view of life is not much different than that of the rest of her family but embodies the journey that affirms the importance of their spiritual experience. She is born into a babe-in-the-woods atmosphere, in which her village lives as they have for centuries. All is in its place like the ancestors who are buried on land that has been in the same family for so long. Then a warplane screams across the sky, and in a heartbeat all she knows is sieged. What she believes to be her fate will take her from the rice patties of the Central Highlands to the sprawling bubble of California. Oliver Stone has made films about Vietnam from the point of view of a combat infantryman and a paralyzed veteran, and now in this unsung gem he punctuates an indispensable installment into a trilogy by seeing the war through the eyes of a Vietnamese woman. The story is true, as were Platoon, drawn from his own first-hand experience, and Born on the Fourth of July, based on the autobiography of Ron Kovic. I feel safe in saying that the seminal spirituality of this film is objective, and vitally so, because there are many things about this film that seem externally uncharacteristic of Stone's body of work. For instance, he is not known for films about women. This is the first time he has had to place himself inside a woman's thoughts, and that he indiscriminately does owes no small piece to Hiep Thi Le's performance in the leading role. Having been born in Vietnam, come to America as a child, knowing both worlds, is perfectly cast for such a culturally and realistically complicated character to portray. Seeing the war through her eyes, watching as foreign troops beeline across the fields of her family, we are asked by Stone to see how radically antagonistic the American strategy in Vietnam was. The long-term aim was to win the "hearts and minds" of the Vietnamese people. With this intent, we displaced them from the land of their ancestors, and shepherded them into "strategic hamlets" made to force the Viet Cong out, even if they worked more like camps to keep the residents in. This strife indeed emboldened them to relate to the Cong, who appreciated their same ideals. For common growers who wanted just to farm, the war brought nightmarish dilemmas. Into her life one day comes a towering, rugged American named Steve Butler, in one of Tommy Lee Jones's becoming, persuasive and mood-swinging performances, who does not want her as a hooker, but as a wife. He is kind, compassionate, determined, yet maybe if she were less hard up she would discern a worrying connotation when he claims, "I want an Oriental wife." His image of her is desperately entwined with his own internal debilitations, his need for a woman who will concurrently absolve him, and submit to him. Le Ly returns to America as Mrs. Steve Butler, to a land where the supermarket shelves seem to sprawl infinitely in all vectors and the in-laws treat her as something between a darling and an embarrassment. One of her American relatives is played, through skillful casting, by Debbie Reynolds. Le Ly has issues adapting, but not as many as her husband, who learns that his groundwork and 20 years as a "military adviser" have left him despairingly unfit for civilian life. Jones shows his talent for characters who are never scarier than when they are simpatico. The anamorphic cinematography by the great Robert Richardson dials up the color palette so that the transition from the horrific chaos in Vietnam and the commodified epic pleasantry of America is almost explosively surreal. We follow Le Ly and her new husband into supermarkets and split-level San Diego kitchens with relentless wide angle lenses and sometimes even the out-of-sync slow motion Stone would soon fall in love with while making Natural Born Killers. Part of what made Stone such a draw in the earlier half of his career and a deterrent in his latter half is that he treasures politically controversial topics. When the Vietnam War was the most vital in contemporary American history, just Stone made it his work as a filmmaker. Movies are a very different course to make a meaningful assertion than one which can be accompanied by explanatory notes. Movies interface in the ways things show, sense, sound. In Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and now Heaven and Earth, Stone has us see through eyes that saw three bases of that atrocity.

    Heaven & Earth (1993) was the final part of Oliver Stone's Viet-Nam Trilogy. The story follows a Vietnamese Peasant girl named Ly Le who's idyllic life in her village is changed forever by a civil war in her country. Both sides deal horrific atrocities against her and the rest of the village. Can Ly Le weather the storm that is the Vietnam War and keep her head up? What will happen to her village as the war gets more violent and brutal on both sides? How far can the human condition be under such extremes and still remain sane? You'll have to find out by watching this harrowing film Heaven & Earth. I really like this movie, Oliver Stone is such a masterful storyteller and the acting, directing and writing kept me on edge throughout the entire film. I have to highly recommend this film. Joan Chen (who still looks hot underneath the make-up), Tommy Lee Jones, Dr. Haing S. Ngor co-star as well. Highly recommended

    This is the third movie in director Olvier Stone's unofficial Vietnam War trilogy after Platoon and Born On The Fourth July. It is the least known of these movies and also the worst of them. Which doesn't mean it's bad, far from it, it's actually pretty good. Like Born On The Fourth Of July (and many other Oliver Stone films), Heaven & Earth is based on a true story, this time around that of Vietnamese humanitarian Phung Thi Le Ly Hayslip. Though the Vietnam War is very much present in this movie, it is less a war movie than the previous two, instead more of a "biography" film. And one of the problems with this movie is that though the main character goes through many ordeals and suffers many hardships, you never really feel for her, connect with her. Or at least I didn't, and often found her to be somewhat annoying. Despite his prominent presence in the posters, Tommy Lee Jones is really more of a secondary character here and only appears about an hour and ten minutes into the movie, as a fictional character that was merged from two separate men in Le Ly Hayslip's life. Oliver Stone does have detractors and his latest films haven't been his strongest, but he's generally accepted as one of the "good" directors in Hollywood. Heaven & Earth isn't his best film, but it's still a very well-made one, with some beautiful shots of Vietnam (actually Thailand) and particularly brilliant scenes in America. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film strongly, but once again, there's still some very good stuff in there, so if you're into Oliver Stone, movies about Vietnam War, or movies in general for that matter, it's a nice one to watch.

    Wow, some people live their lives the same way like robots till their death, but this woman lives her life with so many dramas. Same thing is happening in Iraq now, people here in the US are enjoying their lives to the fullest while so many innocent Iraqi people are suffering with no end. I am surprised that the rating is not too high. The movie "Deer hunter" which was also about Vietname war, it was so slow and boring. If it didn't win some Oscars, I would have stopped watching in the middle of it. This movie is about the same feature length, but this one is much more emotional, and not boring at all. It is another tear-jerking movie. This movie helped me to understand the pain that Vietnamese people suffered during the war. It is very authentic. Those are the common people who just want to make the best out of their lives, they just want to live. It was especially touching when she finally came back to her village, and her brother told her about how he felt throughout the years. She is not a hero, but she is such a brave woman who suffered so much, who almost died. How many of us will ever live a life like hers. In the end, this movie makes all of us to treasure the life that we have now, there are so many people who are living in this world who still don't have the things that we take for granted. Thank you for all those who worked on this great movie.

    The third, and most likely final , film in Oliver Stone's trilogy about the Vietnam war is here. In "Platoon" we learned of the horrors of war through the eyes of new recruit Chris Taylor, "Born on the Fourth of July" covered the story of Vietnam veteran come anti-war activist Ron Kovic, and "Heaven and Earth" finally completes the picture by giving us the Vietnam perspective. Based on two autobiographical novels by Le Ly Hayslip, this high powered drama concerns her struggle for survival in war torn Vietnam, as both the allied forces and the North Vietnamese Army constantly threaten her village with death and destruction. Once again stone has created a thought provoking and disturbing piece of cinema, as we follow young Le through her tragic life from ravaged Vietnam to the United States. Hiep Thi Li is very impressive as Hayslip in her film debut, while Tommy Lee Jones, Haing S. Ngor and Joan Chen are strong in support. The cinematography (Robert Richardson) is quite superb as is the sweeping score (Kitaro). Unfortunately "Heaven and Earth" is not as forceful and powerful as the previous films, but this can be attributed to the fact that it is once again not as focused a work as its predecessors, and also because we've seen it before in Stone's earlier war epics, thus it doesn't have the same shocking effect. However, little else can be faulted in yet another eye opening drama from Oliver Stone. Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - Knox District Centre The final part in Oliver Stone's Vietnam experience is told from the Vietnamese perspective with both compassion and conviction. Based on Le Ly Hayslip's (pronounced Lay Lee) autobiographical books "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places" and "Child of War, Woman of Peace", our director's screenplay tells the heartbreaking story of a young woman's devastating journey through life, from an innocent victim of war, to the troubled wife of a U.S. Marine. Following on from his powerful war epics "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July", Stone has crafted a very different and somehow more emotionally involving drama. A magnificent performance from newcomer Hiep Thi Le brings us close to Le Ly's plight as she is first tortured by the Allies and the V.C., then forced to leave her village and try to survive on the streets of Saigon. Strong support comes from Academy Award winner Dr. Haing S. Ngor, Joan Chen and Tommy Lee Jones. Robert Richardson returns to again bring us some startling images of war, as well as some impacting pictures of western society (one particular wide lens shot of a refrigerator alone manages to put our indulgent, wasteful culture to shame). Kitaro provides a sweeping score and the Art Direction and Set Decoration keep things very authentic. As in "J.F.K.", Oliver Stone has crammed so much into "Heaven and Earth" that it's a lot like trying to cope with "Reader's Digest". Yet, though it starts slowly, Stone shows for a third successive time the evil of war and the way in which it destroys lives, families, villages and entire countries. "Heaven and Earth" is also a sobering reminder of our flamboyant and richly blessed lifestyle, and one that's free of the ravages of war. If you don't object to being bludgeoned with a point of view, then all three of Oliver Stone's Vietnam works come highly recommended. Sunday, October 23, 1994 - Video

    This movie gives a passionate and realistic view of the war. Things that really happened such as army guys trying to bring Vietnamese wives back to American and trying to make it work out. Like others have commented it makes you question who really started this war and for what reasons. Tommy Lee Jones character says it all in that quiet whisper that turns into an ugly argument when he tells his wife his mission is and has always been from the beginning to sell arms to countries such as her country. So it gets you thinking about what war is really about. Obviously the soldiers are trained to follow orders and not think about or question those orders. That would result in discharge. And for many in the war it dragged on for years on end and eventually people realize the pointlessness of it. How can the supposed most powerful nation on earth loose a war? You can break their backs with superior technology but you can't break their spirit. And you can never completely eradicate a poor people from their own country. There will aways be a resistance no matter how small. So you can never really win. It's like the old school yard bully who beats up on all the small guys. But as long as people despise the power and strength of the arrogant and evil bully there will always be resistance until the bully eventually pulls back and his pride injured. This has happened throughout all of history in all the world empires. Why is it we believe we are something different? This movie in someways gets you to think about that. Could it possibly be that we are the ones to blame? That we are where the problems started? But of course no one wants to consider that when it is so much easier to and cowardly to blame other people. That is why this film wasn't as well known and didn't rake in the multi-millions as other more popular Rambo movies.

    It's interesting that when this film was released in 1993 that the prominent scene shown in film review shows is the scene where the South Vietnamese Army enter the village of Le Ly and come under attack by the VC . This gives the impression you're going to be watching a Vietnam film and the early part of the film does concentrate on the history of Vietnam . Too much so because if you do have a rough outline of Vietnamese history then you'll find the main story is being held up by Le Ly's potted history of Vietnam at every opportunity . There is a train of thought that if a film is too reliant on voice over then the film is failing on that level and this may well be a case in point That's not the only flaw . The way everything is shot gives an idealised view of a far off exotic land . If the Vietnamese government want to do a plug for visiting Vietnam then director Oliver Stone has done the country a big favour . There's a war on don't you and no matter what Le Ly's village still manages to look like a Utopian destination and despite people getting frequently killed and raped one wonders why on Earth anyone would want to leave here . Indeed the cynic in me wonders if Stone is seeking a personal redemption by making this film . I know Stone volunteered for military service in Vietnam and I know prior to that he volunteered to be an English language teacher in Vietnam but yet I never felt I was watching a real world view of Vietnam , more of a clich&eacute;d Lonely Planet romanticised Westerner view of the country There's also another flaw and that is Stone seems obsessed with Eastern mysticism . Heaven and Earth ? Ying and Yang ? Slumdog non millionaire and other new age nonsense as Stone concentrates on Karma and other metaphysical nonsense . The Vietnam war came about via Cold War politics and had nothing to do with nature or anything else outside of human engineered power struggles . Stone wants us to believe that a spiritual force is controlling everything but I'm afraid I'm more likely to listen to historians and scientists rather than soothsayers . The main flaw of the movie is that the story is ugly but the visuals are beautiful and while the audience can understand the point Stone is making via this technique it doesn't make new age thinking anymore credible

    To me, this and JFK are the best movies from director Oliver Stone, but the two are world apart as far as the movie goes. First the backdrop of each scene of this movie makes you yearn for somewhere to go home to. Then you see the tanks, the soldiers, and of course the war shows that home is being ravaged into a place where you can't go any more. I actually feel being torn away from the place of my heart, and I'm not even Vietnamese. So I'd say the visual impact of this movie is high. South Viet Nam was a relatively wealthy country in Southeast Asia because they had the perfect climate for growing rice and crops, but just because of the war, you see people becoming destitute. The way the story and the visuals comes together in this movie is one of the best I've seen. It really provokes something in the heart. I've never had a movie experience like this before or since I've seen this movie. The only negative I can see is the poor quality of Asian female actors. Except for Hiep who played the lead role, everyone else was bad to the point of being painful to watch. If a movie is supposed to tell the story and give the simulated experience of the people who are in the story, this is without a doubt one of the best movie I've ever seen.

    Heaven and Earth (1993) follows Platoon (1986) and Born of the Fourth of July (1989) to conclude director Oliver Stone's Vietnam War trilogy. Where Stone won Best Director Oscars for both previous films, Heaven and Earth proved a box-office disaster and went unrecognized by the Academy, though Kitaro bagged a Golden Globe for his haunting score. It's hard not to suspect that racism underlay the commercial failure, for where the hit movies addressed the sufferings of white American soldiers played by Hollywood stars, Heaven and Earth focused on the fundamental victims, adapting the true story of a young Vietnamese woman, Le Ly, who goes from village girl to freedom fighter to wife of a US marine struggling to adjust to life in America to reconciliation in Vietnam. Superbly made, with a stunning performance by Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly, and powerful support from Tommy Lee Jones, this is intelligent, harrowing film-making that attempts to understand and bridge the divide between nations traumatized by war.

    The third of Oliver Stone's trilogy on the Vietnam war, is also the least known of the three. However, that does not reflect on its quality in any way. I found this as compelling, if not more, a portrait of the effects of war on the human psyche. The story is based on the true life memoirs of Le Ly Hayslip, a woman caught in a Vietnamese village during the Vietnam war, and who later flourished in the US. While, some of the characters may have been fictional, by and large it seems to be a faithful adaptation. The cinematography in the village (supposed to be Vietnam, but I heard is Thailand) is breathtakingly beautiful, and I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to see this on the big screen. The movie follows the life of Le Ly, as she grows up in a peaceful village in Vietnam, farming with her parents and siblings. Life seems idyllic till the VietCong appear. Their propaganda against the government influences some of the villagers to support them. Eventually the government forces come and start taking away villagers for questioning (torture). One such day, Le Ly is taken away. The sequences depicting the torture are pretty graphic and not for the faint of heart. Eventually, after she is released, she makes her way to the city with her mother, and her story continues, eventually ending up with meeting a marine, Steve Butler (Tommy Lee Jones, who makes his appearance after an hour into the movie) and flying to the US. The story quite beautifully captures the effect the war has on different individuals, including an amazing transformation in the character of Steve Butler, as he is tormented in the USA by images of the war and by his own failures afterwards. The acting is very good mostly, including a brilliant turn by Haing S. Ngor, who shot to prominence with his role in 'The Killing Fields'. The story eventually manages to capture the spirit of this lady, who overcame some bitter hardships in life.

Based on two autobiographical novels by Le Ly Hayslip, this high powered drama concerns her struggle for survival in war torn Vietnam, as both the allied forces and the North Vietnamese Army constantly threaten her village with death and destruction. Once again stone has created a thought provoking and disturbing piece of cinema, as we follow young Le through her tragic life from ravaged Vietnam to the United States. Hiep Thi Li is very impressive as Hayslip in her film debut, while Tommy Lee Jones, Haing S. Ngor and Joan Chen are strong in support. The cinematography (Robert Richardson) is quite superb as is the sweeping score (Kitaro). Unfortunately "Heaven and Earth" is not as forceful and powerful as the previous films, but this can be attributed to the fact that it is once again not as focused a work as its predecessors, and also because we've seen it before in Stone's earlier war epics, thus it doesn't have the same shocking effect. However, little else can be faulted in yet another eye opening drama from Oliver Stone. Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - Knox District Centre The final part in Oliver Stone's Vietnam experience is told from the Vietnamese perspective with both compassion and conviction. Based on Le Ly Hayslip's (pronounced Lay Lee) autobiographical books "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places" and "Child of War, Woman of Peace", our director's screenplay tells the heartbreaking story of a young woman's devastating journey through life, from an innocent victim of war, to the troubled wife of a U.S. Marine. Following on from his powerful war epics "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July", Stone has crafted a very different and somehow more emotionally involving drama. A magnificent performance from newcomer Hiep Thi Le brings us close to Le Ly's plight as she is first tortured by the Allies and the V.C., then forced to leave her village and try to survive on the streets of Saigon. Strong support comes from Academy Award winner Dr. Haing S. Ngor, Joan Chen and Tommy Lee Jones. Robert Richardson returns to again bring us some startling images of war, as well as some impacting pictures of western society (one particular wide lens shot of a refrigerator alone manages to put our indulgent, wasteful culture to shame). Kitaro provides a sweeping score and the Art Direction and Set Decoration keep things very authentic. As in "J.F.K.", Oliver Stone has crammed so much into "Heaven and Earth" that it's a lot like trying to cope with "Reader's Digest". Yet, though it starts slowly, Stone shows for a third successive time the evil of war and the way in which it destroys lives, families, villages and entire countries. "Heaven and Earth" is also a sobering reminder of our flamboyant and richly blessed lifestyle, and one that's free of the ravages of war. If you don't object to being bludgeoned with a point of view, then all three of Oliver Stone's Vietnam works come highly recommended. Sunday, October 23, 1994 - Video

    This movie gives a passionate and realistic view of the war. Things that really happened such as army guys trying to bring Vietnamese wives back to American and trying to make it work out. Like others have commented it makes you question who really started this war and for what reasons. Tommy Lee Jones character says it all in that quiet whisper that turns into an ugly argument when he tells his wife his mission is and has always been from the beginning to sell arms to countries such as her country. So it gets you thinking about what war is really about. Obviously the soldiers are trained to follow orders and not think about or question those orders. That would result in discharge. And for many in the war it dragged on for years on end and eventually people realize the pointlessness of it. How can the supposed most powerful nation on earth loose a war? You can break their backs with superior technology but you can't break their spirit. And you can never completely eradicate a poor people from their own country. There will aways be a resistance no matter how small. So you can never really win. It's like the old school yard bully who beats up on all the small guys. But as long as people despise the power and strength of the arrogant and evil bully there will always be resistance until the bully eventually pulls back and his pride injured. This has happened throughout all of history in all the world empires. Why is it we believe we are something different? This movie in someways gets you to think about that. Could it possibly be that we are the ones to blame? That we are where the problems started? But of course no one wants to consider that when it is so much easier to and cowardly to blame other people. That is why this film wasn't as well known and didn't rake in the multi-millions as other more popular Rambo movies.

    It's interesting that when this film was released in 1993 that the prominent scene shown in film review shows is the scene where the South Vietnamese Army enter the village of Le Ly and come under attack by the VC . This gives the impression you're going to be watching a Vietnam film and the early part of the film does concentrate on the history of Vietnam . Too much so because if you do have a rough outline of Vietnamese history then you'll find the main story is being held up by Le Ly's potted history of Vietnam at every opportunity . There is a train of thought that if a film is too reliant on voice over then the film is failing on that level and this may well be a case in point That's not the only flaw . The way everything is shot gives an idealised view of a far off exotic land . If the Vietnamese government want to do a plug for visiting Vietnam then director Oliver Stone has done the country a big favour . There's a war on don't you and no matter what Le Ly's village still manages to look like a Utopian destination and despite people getting frequently killed and raped one wonders why on Earth anyone would want to leave here . Indeed the cynic in me wonders if Stone is seeking a personal redemption by making this film . I know Stone volunteered for military service in Vietnam and I know prior to that he volunteered to be an English language teacher in Vietnam but yet I never felt I was watching a real world view of Vietnam , more of a clich&eacute;d Lonely Planet romanticised Westerner view of the country There's also another flaw and that is Stone seems obsessed with Eastern mysticism . Heaven and Earth ? Ying and Yang ? Slumdog non millionaire and other new age nonsense as Stone concentrates on Karma and other metaphysical nonsense . The Vietnam war came about via Cold War politics and had nothing to do with nature or anything else outside of human engineered power struggles . Stone wants us to believe that a spiritual force is controlling everything but I'm afraid I'm more likely to listen to historians and scientists rather than soothsayers . The main flaw of the movie is that the story is ugly but the visuals are beautiful and while the audience can understand the point Stone is making via this technique it doesn't make new age thinking anymore credible

    To me, this and JFK are the best movies from director Oliver Stone, but the two are world apart as far as the movie goes. First the backdrop of each scene of this movie makes you yearn for somewhere to go home to. Then you see the tanks, the soldiers, and of course the war shows that home is being ravaged into a place where you can't go any more. I actually feel being torn away from the place of my heart, and I'm not even Vietnamese. So I'd say the visual impact of this movie is high. South Viet Nam was a relatively wealthy country in Southeast Asia because they had the perfect climate for growing rice and crops, but just because of the war, you see people becoming destitute. The way the story and the visuals comes together in this movie is one of the best I've seen. It really provokes something in the heart. I've never had a movie experience like this before or since I've seen this movie. The only negative I can see is the poor quality of Asian female actors. Except for Hiep who played the lead role, everyone else was bad to the point of being painful to watch. If a movie is supposed to tell the story and give the simulated experience of the people who are in the story, this is without a doubt one of the best movie I've ever seen.

    Heaven and Earth (1993) follows Platoon (1986) and Born of the Fourth of July (1989) to conclude director Oliver Stone's Vietnam War trilogy. Where Stone won Best Director Oscars for both previous films, Heaven and Earth proved a box-office disaster and went unrecognized by the Academy, though Kitaro bagged a Golden Globe for his haunting score. It's hard not to suspect that racism underlay the commercial failure, for where the hit movies addressed the sufferings of white American soldiers played by Hollywood stars, Heaven and Earth focused on the fundamental victims, adapting the true story of a young Vietnamese woman, Le Ly, who goes from village girl to freedom fighter to wife of a US marine struggling to adjust to life in America to reconciliation in Vietnam. Superbly made, with a stunning performance by Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly, and powerful support from Tommy Lee Jones, this is intelligent, harrowing film-making that attempts to understand and bridge the divide between nations traumatized by war.

    The third of Oliver Stone's trilogy on the Vietnam war, is also the least known of the three. However, that does not reflect on its quality in any way. I found this as compelling, if not more, a portrait of the effects of war on the human psyche. The story is based on the true life memoirs of Le Ly Hayslip, a woman caught in a Vietnamese village during the Vietnam war, and who later flourished in the US. While, some of the characters may have been fictional, by and large it seems to be a faithful adaptation. The cinematography in the village (supposed to be Vietnam, but I heard is Thailand) is breathtakingly beautiful, and I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to see this on the big screen. The movie follows the life of Le Ly, as she grows up in a peaceful village in Vietnam, farming with her parents and siblings. Life seems idyllic till the VietCong appear. Their propaganda against the government influences some of the villagers to support them. Eventually the government forces come and start taking away villagers for questioning (torture). One such day, Le Ly is taken away. The sequences depicting the torture are pretty graphic and not for the faint of heart. Eventually, after she is released, she makes her way to the city with her mother, and her story continues, eventually ending up with meeting a marine, Steve Butler (Tommy Lee Jones, who makes his appearance after an hour into the movie) and flying to the US. The story quite beautifully captures the effect the war has on different individuals, including an amazing transformation in the character of Steve Butler, as he is tormented in the USA by images of the war and by his own failures afterwards. The acting is very good mostly, including a brilliant turn by Haing S. Ngor, who shot to prominence with his role in 'The Killing Fields'. The story eventually manages to capture the spirit of this lady, who overcame some bitter hardships in life.

    Stone looks objectively at the spiritual way of life led by a Vietnamese village, how they mind immaterial happiness to be able to survive the misery of their corporeal lives. The film begins as an exposition of the village, then begins to focus on one of its resident families, and all the while slowly tightens more and more into a study of one of the daughters, an impassioned girl named Le Ly, whose view of life is not much different than that of the rest of her family but embodies the journey that affirms the importance of their spiritual experience. She is born into a babe-in-the-woods atmosphere, in which her village lives as they have for centuries. All is in its place like the ancestors who are buried on land that has been in the same family for so long. Then a warplane screams across the sky, and in a heartbeat all she knows is sieged. What she believes to be her fate will take her from the rice patties of the Central Highlands to the sprawling bubble of California. Oliver Stone has made films about Vietnam from the point of view of a combat infantryman and a paralyzed veteran, and now in this unsung gem he punctuates an indispensable installment into a trilogy by seeing the war through the eyes of a Vietnamese woman. The story is true, as were Platoon, drawn from his own first-hand experience, and Born on the Fourth of July, based on the autobiography of Ron Kovic. I feel safe in saying that the seminal spirituality of this film is objective, and vitally so, because there are many things about this film that seem externally uncharacteristic of Stone's body of work. For instance, he is not known for films about women. This is the first time he has had to place himself inside a woman's thoughts, and that he indiscriminately does owes no small piece to Hiep Thi Le's performance in the leading role. Having been born in Vietnam, come to America as a child, knowing both worlds, is perfectly cast for such a culturally and realistically complicated character to portray. Seeing the war through her eyes, watching as foreign troops beeline across the fields of her family, we are asked by Stone to see how radically antagonistic the American strategy in Vietnam was. The long-term aim was to win the "hearts and minds" of the Vietnamese people. With this intent, we displaced them from the land of their ancestors, and shepherded them into "strategic hamlets" made to force the Viet Cong out, even if they worked more like camps to keep the residents in. This strife indeed emboldened them to relate to the Cong, who appreciated their same ideals. For common growers who wanted just to farm, the war brought nightmarish dilemmas. Into her life one day comes a towering, rugged American named Steve Butler, in one of Tommy Lee Jones's becoming, persuasive and mood-swinging performances, who does not want her as a hooker, but as a wife. He is kind, compassionate, determined, yet maybe if she were less hard up she would discern a worrying connotation when he claims, "I want an Oriental wife." His image of her is desperately entwined with his own internal debilitations, his need for a woman who will concurrently absolve him, and submit to him. Le Ly returns to America as Mrs. Steve Butler, to a land where the supermarket shelves seem to sprawl infinitely in all vectors and the in-laws treat her as something between a darling and an embarrassment. One of her American relatives is played, through skillful casting, by Debbie Reynolds. Le Ly has issues adapting, but not as many as her husband, who learns that his groundwork and 20 years as a "military adviser" have left him despairingly unfit for civilian life. Jones shows his talent for characters who are never scarier than when they are simpatico. The anamorphic cinematography by the great Robert Richardson dials up the color palette so that the transition from the horrific chaos in Vietnam and the commodified epic pleasantry of America is almost explosively surreal. We follow Le Ly and her new husband into supermarkets and split-level San Diego kitchens with relentless wide angle lenses and sometimes even the out-of-sync slow motion Stone would soon fall in love with while making Natural Born Killers. Part of what made Stone such a draw in the earlier half of his career and a deterrent in his latter half is that he treasures politically controversial topics. When the Vietnam War was the most vital in contemporary American history, just Stone made it his work as a filmmaker. Movies are a very different course to make a meaningful assertion than one which can be accompanied by explanatory notes. Movies interface in the ways things show, sense, sound. In Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and now Heaven and Earth, Stone has us see through eyes that saw three bases of that atrocity.

    Heaven & Earth (1993) was the final part of Oliver Stone's Viet-Nam Trilogy. The story follows a Vietnamese Peasant girl named Ly Le who's idyllic life in her village is changed forever by a civil war in her country. Both sides deal horrific atrocities against her and the rest of the village. Can Ly Le weather the storm that is the Vietnam War and keep her head up? What will happen to her village as the war gets more violent and brutal on both sides? How far can the human condition be under such extremes and still remain sane? You'll have to find out by watching this harrowing film Heaven & Earth. I really like this movie, Oliver Stone is such a masterful storyteller and the acting, directing and writing kept me on edge throughout the entire film. I have to highly recommend this film. Joan Chen (who still looks hot underneath the make-up), Tommy Lee Jones, Dr. Haing S. Ngor co-star as well. Highly recommended

    This is the third movie in director Olvier Stone's unofficial Vietnam War trilogy after Platoon and Born On The Fourth July. It is the least known of these movies and also the worst of them. Which doesn't mean it's bad, far from it, it's actually pretty good. Like Born On The Fourth Of July (and many other Oliver Stone films), Heaven & Earth is based on a true story, this time around that of Vietnamese humanitarian Phung Thi Le Ly Hayslip. Though the Vietnam War is very much present in this movie, it is less a war movie than the previous two, instead more of a "biography" film. And one of the problems with this movie is that though the main character goes through many ordeals and suffers many hardships, you never really feel for her, connect with her. Or at least I didn't, and often found her to be somewhat annoying. Despite his prominent presence in the posters, Tommy Lee Jones is really more of a secondary character here and only appears about an hour and ten minutes into the movie, as a fictional character that was merged from two separate men in Le Ly Hayslip's life. Oliver Stone does have detractors and his latest films haven't been his strongest, but he's generally accepted as one of the "good" directors in Hollywood. Heaven & Earth isn't his best film, but it's still a very well-made one, with some beautiful shots of Vietnam (actually Thailand) and particularly brilliant scenes in America. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film strongly, but once again, there's still some very good stuff in there, so if you're into Oliver Stone, movies about Vietnam War, or movies in general for that matter, it's a nice one to watch.

    Wow, some people live their lives the same way like robots till their death, but this woman lives her life with so many dramas. Same thing is happening in Iraq now, people here in the US are enjoying their lives to the fullest while so many innocent Iraqi people are suffering with no end. I am surprised that the rating is not too high. The movie "Deer hunter" which was also about Vietname war, it was so slow and boring. If it didn't win some Oscars, I would have stopped watching in the middle of it. This movie is about the same feature length, but this one is much more emotional, and not boring at all. It is another tear-jerking movie. This movie helped me to understand the pain that Vietnamese people suffered during the war. It is very authentic. Those are the common people who just want to make the best out of their lives, they just want to live. It was especially touching when she finally came back to her village, and her brother told her about how he felt throughout the years. She is not a hero, but she is such a brave woman who suffered so much, who almost died. How many of us will ever live a life like hers. In the end, this movie makes all of us to treasure the life that we have now, there are so many people who are living in this world who still don't have the things that we take for granted. Thank you for all those who worked on this great movie.
