    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'.

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    Jack Nicholson movies are usually really good. But this is one that really didn't satisfy me. For its credit the beginning of the movie is actually pretty decent, but then it slowly goes downhill. It would be better if the movie focused more on horror then on romance between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Despite good performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer it doesn't really help this movie much One of the big problems is James Spader. Spader doesn't do anything that really stands out and it doesn't seem like he should have been cast in the role of the main antagonist . He isn't a bad actor but I don't think he fit this role at all. The Rest of the cast is pretty decent not really much else to say about that. But some of the characters don't have much too them especially Jack Nicholson's Wife in the movie played by Kate Nelligan. Nelligan doesn't give a bad performance but her character just kinda disappears and eventually *Spoiler Alert* is killed off, i honestly wish she had more of a purpose. Another problem is the movie is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie at all, the fact that Jack Nicholson is becoming a werewolf doesn't make it anything more then a Drama-Romance mainly set in the workplace. Overall I didn't really like it after the first hour after that the rest of the movie falls pretty flat. My Rating 4.5/10

    While driving through Vermont, New England, the middle age chief editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes rabies vaccine and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in her job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by the tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he offers an unwanted job position in Eastern Europe to him and he learns that he had been betrayed by Stewart, who will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). On the next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. Further he discovers that Charlotte is cheating on him with Stewart and that Laura and he are in love with each other. But Will Randall is becoming a wolf and his transformation changes completely his life. I saw "Wolf" for the first time in 1994 and yesterday I saw this film again and I found it better and better than the first time that I saw it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Lobo" ("Wolf")

    I usually love Werewolf movies, but "Wolf", fails completely. A better script and better acting from Nicholson might have made this work. Nicholson under-acts through the entire film. Whether he is a man or a werewolf. And he was too old even in 1994 for a part as physical as this one. Watching him jump high and fly through the air looks ridiculous and it is way too obvious that most of those scenes was performed by a stunt double. I don't know what annoys me more, that we never see Randall kill anybody (the deer doesn't count) not even his own wife, or that Randall stay good through the entire film. Nicholson is great at playing psychopaths. He should have mentally changed. As he became more and more a werewolf, he should have become more and more evil and cold. Spader gave a more convincing performance, because his character: Stewart was a douche-bag from the beginning and he had the pshysique and age to be a convincing werewolf. Pfeiffer was mostly just annoying. Considering Rick Baker made the still impressive special effects makeup on there much older: An American Werewolf in London and on Wolf, the makeup on Wolf, is a let-down. I want gore and horror, when i see a movie about werewolfs, but this movie was never scary at all. Seeing Randall howling against the moon is laughable, not scary. If it wasn't for the language, this could have been a PG13 movie. There is almost no blood at all. I expect more than this from an R-rated horror movie. A lot more!!

    The beginning of this movie, built around Jack Nicholson's slow and reluctant realization that he may be becoming a werewolf, really sparkles. Jack's performance, as a slightly grungy middle-aged everyman caught up in an absurd and increasingly frightening scenario, makes the first part of the film compelling viewing. Act II introduces the charismatic Michelle Pfieffer as a rich bad girl, upon whom Jack becomes increasingly dependent as his condition begins to spiral beyond his control. As in any good horror thriller, secrets then come to light and the unknown and previously unthinkable begin to intrude into the contemporary world. The finale, however, is a disappointing mish-mash of action thriller clich&eacute;s, ie. fights, chases etc. and serves as a classic example of Hollywood's now lost capability to properly script Act III in a modern action movie. It's a shame, as it lets down a strong Act I and a pretty watchable Act II.

    'Wolf' is an Entertaining & Engrossing Horror Flick, along-with Top-Notch Direction & Terrific Performances. 'Wolf' Synopsis: Publisher Will Randall becomes a werewolf and has to fight to keep his job. 'Wolf' is interesting, frightening & quite engrossing. Jim Harrison & Wesley Strick's Screenplay is packed with solid entertainment. Mike Nichols's Direction, like always, is Top-Notch. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson as Will Randall who becomes a Werewolf, is terrific, as usual. The Acting GOD proves his mettle once again! Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect, while James Spader is marvelous as the despicable villain. Kate Nelligan is impressive. Christopher Plummer is as usual. Om Puri is excellent in a cameo. Richard Jenkins does his bit well. Others offer support. On the whole, 'Wolf' is a Winner.

    I love Nicholson and almost always can get by just watching him in whatever. This movie is weird though! Some of the dialog is so forced, stilted. It almost skips or staggers at some points. Very slow. It's unusual and what I can't figure out is HOW they got Jack to do it or WHY. Without spoiling it there is this one scene in the woods involving a deer that I just kind of watched in disbelief. I know it was the 90's but still. Then of course there is Michelle and her and Jack were really great together as you would expect and you can overlook that he's obviously old enough to be her dad and so on based just on how great the two of them are. But still I'll say (as a reviewer earlier) that I am one of those poor souls who is just to dumb to "get it" as far as this movie goes. Campy weird almost like a spoof on a horror movie at moments (I'm not a horror fan trust me) Then at other moments real dark and serious. It's almost like the movie couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be. If you like Jack watch it. Michelle is hard not to like so watch it. You like werewolves and want to see a superstar playing one, watch it. Have a few laughs with someone you know. It'll make for a strange evening. Yours FattyZ

    WOLF is, for the most part, a fun and engaging riff on the classic werewolf tale about an ordinary man who finds himself bitten by a wolf and before long ends up howling at the moon. It's slightly overlong, but benefits from great casting in the form of Jack Nicholson, who perfectly channels his lead's wolfish nature; out of all the actors working in Hollywood, Nicholson is the one you can truly believe has a bit of the devil in him. What I liked about WOLF is that it avoids being hokum for the most part. I like B-movies as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see something different and I loved the way this film explores the beast in man theme in a corporate environment. Watching Nicholson's developing rivalry with a slimy James Spader is particularly fine, culminating in that memorable gross-out scene in the men's bathroom. It's not a perfect film by any means, and some of it does drag a bit. The scriptwriters clearly didn't know what to do with Michelle Pfeiffer's perfunctory love interest and her presence is a little gruelling on the viewer's patience. Still, the excellent Spader helps to make up for that, and there are nice, if minor, parts for Prunella Scales, Eileen Atkins and Christopher Plummer. There's a lot of comedy, too, which works a treat. Rick Baker's special effects are a mix of good and bad. Nicholson's wolfman makeup is decent, but the animatronic wolves look like they belong in a little kid's film rather than an adult movie. And director Mike Nichols is clearly better at handling the dialogue than he is the action - all those slow-mo shots of actors jumping through the air gets a bit silly after the umpteenth time. Still, this is a highlight in a decade that was virtually defunct of decent werewolf movies.

    Wolf isn't your stereotypical werewolf horror picture; it's more a murky mystery with romantic tendencies. Wolf takes it sweet time progressing forward through its story although it still remains captivating throughout its slower pace. It teeters on the edge of boredom, and isn't overly interesting, but it stays good. Wolf has a very alluring aura. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are strong and in their prime. Nicholson has reached a point where this lead role isn't overly demanding to him, not too vital towards his career, so he really allows his acting ability to rest easy, not acting all too strenuously. Through this he acquires some added strength, but in totality it's a far lesser performance as is often the case when actors attempt to explore their abilities in similar manners. Oddly enough, something strangely similar is going on with Michelle in her role. She too seems at ease, more comfortable in this part than usual. She looks like she's having a good time. Is perhaps Michelle in her own life arriving at the very cusp of some newly enlightened happiness? Or am I just detecting that undeniable sexual chemistry between she and Jack? Probably the chemistry. Whatever it is, it works, making for two rarefied performances. Jack plays the wolf in Wolf, but Pfeiffer is the one who appears primal. (Grrrowrrrrrrrrrr) When Michelle Pfeiffer comes on screen, Wolf gets a lot better, a whole lot better. All of the best parts are the scenes with Pfeiffer. Wolf has an entirely different feel when Michelle's on screen and she gives the strongest performance, steals the limelight, and manages the show on her own. She'll heighten your senses, alright. Everything that happens in this movie outside the moments between Nicholson and Pfeiffer seem faded as if from some separate realm, yet are still very serviceable. Wolf's mesmerizing. It's one good ass movie. I would love to see Wolf II starring Michelle Pfieffer, considering she turns into a werewolf. Where the hell is that movie?

    I once had the opportunity to watch this film on TV, but there was another one playing at the same time and I had to choose between them. Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'. Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this: everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'. The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer). The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly. The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist. Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie. Just don't make the mistake of expecting an horror picture.

    After publishing executive Will Randall is bitten by a wolf, his life begins to change. First his mood changes, and his sense of hearing and smell go into overdrive. Will has become a werewolf and he has an appetite for human blood. His friend Laura wants to help, but she doesn't know what Will is yet. If Will's new problem wasn't enough to keep him occupied he must also contend with Stewart Swinton who is out to get his job..... It's another genius piece of casting, Nicholson as a Wolf. He has he features already, and the transformation is astonishing, even now nearly twenty years later. It's a great companion piece to watch with Coppolas' Dracula and Branaghs' Frankenstein, adult and mature horror movie that go for character study rather than scares. When we first meet Will, he's lethargic and almost finished, something Nicholson hadn't really done before. It soon changes, and he's given full reign to go bananas. Pfeiffer seems a little wooden in this, but soon comes alive during the final act, which is brilliant and haunting. Spades almost steals the film from everyone as the slimy sleaze all, and is really unnerving during his final scenes, the make up on him is awesome. Accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack by Morricone, Wolf isn't just a film about a Wolf, it's a film about a man redeeming his life and libido before his time is up. Worth seeing.
