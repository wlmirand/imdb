 <sinopse>
  A Chicago playwright uses self-hypnosis to find the actress whose vintage portrait hangs in a grand hotel.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Young writer Richard Collier is met on the opening night of his first play by an old lady who begs him to "Come back to me". Mystified, he tries to find out about her, and learns that she is a famous stage actress from the early 1900s, Elise McKenna. Becoming more and more obsessed with her, he manages, by self hypnosis, to travel back in time where he meets her. They fall in love, a matching that is not appreciated by her manager. Can their love outlast the immense problems caused by their "time" difference? And can Richard remain in a time that is not his?

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

    Richard Matheson's novel "Bid Time Return" is the basis for this movie. Richard Matheson, like Philip K. Dick, has been the author and the source for several movies and Star Trek episodes. The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

    Richard Matheson's novel "Bid Time Return" is the basis for this movie. Richard Matheson, like Philip K. Dick, has been the author and the source for several movies and Star Trek episodes. The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

    Richard Matheson's novel "Bid Time Return" is the basis for this movie. Richard Matheson, like Philip K. Dick, has been the author and the source for several movies and Star Trek episodes. The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

    Richard Matheson's novel "Bid Time Return" is the basis for this movie. Richard Matheson, like Philip K. Dick, has been the author and the source for several movies and Star Trek episodes. The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

    You need a heart of steel not to be moved by this beautiful film. I have seen this many times over the years and never understood why it wasn't a spectacular success from the beginning. I am glad it didn't take the usual route because it demonstrated that it had the right material as people discovered it, recognized its quality, and ended up given its right place among cinema classics. With the help of a superb cast, headed by the lovely Jane Seymour, a woman able to project ethereal and eternal beauty with a simple look. There is the dapper Christopher Reeve, trying his best and giving us a suitable performance as the man in a quest to find the perfect woman for him. There is a big problem. She is in the past, and he is in the present. Somehow, they will get together, and as we see from the beginning be separated by their very interesting twist of fate. Reeves is a playwright who visits a hotel and is immediately enchanted by an actress portrait. He really doesn't understand what is pulling him, but he feels the force of an emotion that will lead him into what some might call an impossible journey. Slightly modified from the story is based upon, the hero goes through an exhaustive investigation and sets up the trip back through time. He meets the love of his life, has his dreams come true and eventually tragedy strikes, setting up one of the most traumatic lover separations in the history of cinema. Eventually things are fixed, and we get what we look for in this type of movies, but it must be acknowledged that the entire production is a pleasure, with a luscious and romantic store, an amazing level of chemistry between the two leads, and interesting, complex villain whose heart is also broken on the way to the very romantic conclusion. They just don't make them like this anymore.

    I was in my early twenties when I first saw this movie on TV. My brother, four years my junior, was also there. Both of us products of a working class background and little given to shows of emotion. Not expecting to enjoy this "chick flick" we soon found ourselves caught up in the story and were gripped. We both had tears streaming down our faces by the end and were both manfully trying to hide this from each other. However, there was no hiding the fact that we both agreed that few films had ever unexpectedly crept up on like this one. We loved it. True, without the soundtrack it may not have the same effect, the story is a bit thin ( unless time travel has been achieved by the time you read this) and it was never a hit at the box office. However, if you have an ounce of soul and are truly man enough to not feel threatened by a show of emotion then I can honestly heartily recommend this terrific film. Hire it, buy it second hand or watch out for it on TCM. You will not regret. Truly great!

    Because of his lead role in 1978's "Superman", Christopher Reeve was a very hot actor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now well known for turning down numerous roles during that period. It's too bad he didn't turn down "Somewhere in Time", because this melodramatic, overblown romantic soap opera just isn't very good. Reeve plays young playwright Richard Collier, who is approached in 1972 by an elderly woman who hands him an old pocket watch, and says simply "Come back to me". She dies later that night. Eight years later, Collier is a successful playwright who visits a beautiful old hotel (actually the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island). There, he falls in love with a 68-year-old photo of beautiful stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour). SomehowI guess by thinking really hardCollier finds himself back in 1912 in the same hotel. Collier ends up romancing the beautiful McKenna, much to the irritation of her manager William Fawcett Robinson (a snarling Christopher Plummer). After lots of mundane plot twists, Collier involuntarily returns to 1980 in the same hotel, where he pines for McKenna until he passes out dead. The final scene is a rather trite soft-focus reunion of McKenna and Collier with shimmering bright light and romantic music (actually, this scene may have been the inspiration for the endless "shimmering light scenes" we see in movies nowadays). Probably the best thing about the film is the scenery on Mackinac Island. The actors try, but most of the plot situations are either dumb or just not very interesting. It is good to briefly see Teresa Wright, who plays an old acquaintance of Elise McKenna, but otherwise the cast just doesn't have much to work with. This movie might be good for extremely romantic people but for me it was just boringnot to mention awfully far-fetched.

    Richard Matheson's novel "Bid Time Return" is the basis for this movie. Richard Matheson, like Philip K. Dick, has been the author and the source for several movies and Star Trek episodes. The only thing really wrong about this film is that it takes 35 minutes to "arrive" in the past at the Grand Hotel, which is actually on Mackinaw Island. Is it plausible that one could travel back in time by "will power and hypnosis"? That is the only "weakness" in the film. You must believe this concept, or the film will not "work" for you. The performances of a very young Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve are often criticized. I believe that both their performances are outstanding. Reeve shows a range of emotions not seen in any of his other roles. They have great on-screen chemistry together. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Christopher Plummer plays the impresario that loves his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It's old-fashioned but effective. The ending is sad but better than the novel, where Richard Collier dies of a brain tumor instead of a broken heart. (The "lover's reunion" in Heaven is "reminiscent" of the 1947 film "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir".) Like "The Sound of Music" it's been panned by critics but loved by its "following". It was saved from obscurity by cable and video sales! Excellent 1 hour "Making of" DVD extra made in 2000 when Reeve was still in relatively good health following his equestrian accident.

    Somewhere in Time (1980) This is one huge cheesy overdrawn movie with a fabulous romantic hook and one or two spine-tingling moments. The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman). Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go. The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the "Grand Hotel" as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well. I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality "Affair to Remember," it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.

    Amazing love theme, costuming very good, starts off a little slow, and then moves along at a brisker pace, but I would not have ended the movie version the way it ends. I have not seen it recently, but Jane Seymour's performance was very good, Christopher Reeve's performance, although adequate, was a little tentative. Mackinaw Island's hotel provides a beautiful backdrop for the story. Interestingly enough, there was another movie made the year before - (1979),titled "The Two Worlds of Jenny Logan" which had a similar theme and flavor, but a more satisfying ending. That movie is now public domain and if you do a search for it it can be watched in its entirety on one of the free movie sites. If you search "ABC Movie Of The Week" you will find it among a number of those movies.

    This movie is amiable and civilized. I've watched it twice and will watch it again. Still, this movie is devoid of cinematic merit. It's an example of the creative and technical doldrums that Hollywood was in around 1980. It's also highly derivative, which is one of the fun things about it. We can enjoy catching faint echoes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Red Shoes, It Happened Tomorrow, and other films -- if we've seen them. If we haven't, we're the more likely to join the throng who find this one to be their favorite. Many of the minor performances and directorial touches here hint at the happily farcical spirit of Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow, but they don't set the tone of the movie. John Barry's music hints at Bernard Herrmann's ravishing score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but it doesn't double and treble the effectiveness of the movie as that score did. Christopher Plummer's role as a possessive manager/impresario hints at the central tension of The Red Shoes, but in this movie tension doesn't stand a chance. Ironically, the weakest aspect of Somewhere in Time is the one that seems, after the love story itself, to be the most satisfactory to its devoted fans: the creation of an enchanted period atmosphere. One big problem is that the interior lighting is too even and generally too bright, as in many films of the time. Another is the color process. Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...

    Christopher Reeve(very good here) plays writer Richard Collier, who is met by a mysterious old woman who beckons to "come back to me". Intrigued, he investigates, and finds himself in an experimental form of self-hypnosis, where he wills himself back in time decades earlier, and meets that old lady, only now she is a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna(Jane Seymour, perfectly cast, and entirely believable). They gradually fall in love, much to the consternation of her manager(Christopher Plummer, also good). Beautifully directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who recreates the period setting nicely, and creates an ethereal, melancholy air at that hotel that is most effective. Story does seem fantastic, but the performances are so sincere, and the heartbreak of the doomed romance so believable, that it works despite reservations of credibility. Ending is quite a powerful though, and may move some to tears. Not to be missed.

    It has a rather sweet romantic premise, but I'm afraid that unless you're a completely hopeless romantic, you'll likely find yourself constantly raising your eyebrows and chuckling. "Somewhere in Time" is clearly meant to appeal to emotion - particularly as it relates to love and the supernatural. It offers an interesting glimpse at the mysteries of the universe and the power of love across time, yet I'm afraid it isn't enough to cover up the silly sappiness of the rest of the film. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it wasn't good either. It wants desperately for dialogue! It has a nauseating tendency to fall into the "we're going to stare at each other constantly instead of talking" category of movies (which, in its defense, was a popular fad in '80s movies). The moments where there was actually some dialogue between them was great! I liked the characters, the relationship, everything... but then it went right back into "we're gonna stare at each other some more" mode. And the movie chooses to skim over their first real conversation via a montage! Excuse me? I like to SEE my characters developing their relationships, I don't want to have to assume it happens! Do I even have to talk about the main character? He was dull as rocks. Nothing interesting about him at all... I mean who finds themselves in the past, and only thinks - literally ONLY thinks - of finding this one pretty girl? I mean he didn't even THINK of going to check out some other stuff while he was there? A little sight-seeing? Nope... just the dewy-eyed lover boy who... stares at people creepily. And Christopher Plummer's character? Ahem? He was the only halfway interesting character, and they just left him... unresolved! No finalization, no slap on the wrist for being a jerk, nothing... I mean what? And I understand that their purpose was to keep a lot of things shrouded in mystery, but I really would have liked to know... what happens to his physical body in the present day when his mind goes back? And vice versa? Did he just disappear? And last but not least, how did the girl figure out he was a time traveler, and thus know he'd be alive in 1979 to give him the watch? That was never resolved. OH! And one more thing... she literally knew this guy for a day. And she remembered him her whole life? Now I know that's more of an opinionated issue, and it's meant to demonstrate the power of love, blah blah blah... I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good love story. I can even deal with sappiness when it is done well. This is not done well. Too sappy, too silly.

Hollywood had abandoned dye-transfer Technicolor but had not yet found satisfactorily rich alternatives, and the result was a lot of beige pictures. In this one, the filmmakers have made matters worse by choosing shades of brown or yellow for nearly everything but the rubber ball. On top of all that, the big set-piece idyll on the lawn where the lovers stroll along in a golden haze (a hint of Elvira Madigan) is shot through a filter so golden and so hazy that the scene looks like a washed-out photograph. Yet it doesn't look like an old one. Nothing looks old. Nothing seems to belong to another time, even when that time was current. The portrait photo of Elise doesn't begin to look like a picture taken in 1912, either in original quality or in state of preservation. When Richard gazes at it, there's no sense of yearning across time. Little things like the peanut machine look as if they had been whipped up to give a general impression of the real thing, like props for a school play. And everything is spanking-new. It seems that all objects in the world of 1912 were freshly minted in 1912; nothing had been around awhile. That would be all right in a farce like It Happened Tomorrow. Here, it's one more impediment to achieving the poetic texture or the sense of having been swept through time which the romantic story demands. But, yes, Somewhere in Time is amiable and civilized. It's a nice starting point for collecting favorite movies. If you feel that it's the greatest romance ever made or the best movie you've ever seen, you may have some pleasant discoveries in store for you. Please do enjoy watching this again, as I will. But please also go back in time before 1980 -- back and back -- and see what else there is to see.

    A romantic movie for men made 30 years ago when that was not a popular thing to do... probably why it bombed in theaters. I was introduced to it in 1989 when I was hooked on that master composer John Barry (Rest in Peace Mr. Barry - your music will live forever). I knew all of his movie work including his Bond themes, Born Free, Midnight Cowboy, all leading up to Out of Africa. And there was this one theme from one movie I never saw - Somewhere in Time. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a hundred times until I finally rented the movie. I was not a Christopher Reeves fan, which is another reason I missed the original showing, but the man was perfect in his role. (I was a Jane Seymore fan so that didn't hurt my interest.) The storyline took an unusual path to the relationship between the characters. The two "picture" scenes are my favorites (although I hope they delete the framing in the second someday because it cheapens the film and suggests we are not smart enough to recognize the first). Some things are worth doing once. The irony is that this some movie is worth watching again, and again, and again...
