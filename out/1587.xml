 <sinopse>
  A Swedish whaler is out for revenge when he finds out that a greedy oil man murdered his father for their land.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Sven Hanson is one of a number of farmers whom Ed McNeil wants to run off their land (because he knows there's oil on it). When Hanson is murdered by McNeil's gunman, Johnny Crale, Hanson's friend Pepe Mirada hides his knowledge of the murderer's identity in order to protect his family. When Hanson's son George arrives and takes up his father's cause, not only Mirada but also Johnny Crale begin to reevaluate their attitudes.

    The common man, in this respect a Whaler from Sweden, versus slick and soulless Capitalists. The greedy, rich Men representing the System can purchase fancy attire, and expensive and flashy weapons of destruction. But our lower class type of an immigrant sod buster dresses in plain clothes and is forced to use the tools of his trade to defend his honor and exact revenge. There are no subtle representations here and it is all framed like Artful arrogance and what this stylish B-Western presented is nothing less than one of the most unique and classy Proletariat Pictures from a decade that was full of mediocre meanderings from others by the wagon load. This Norish Western was the last for an unsung B-Movie Master Joseph H. Lewis and his underrated work was missed but not forgotten among Film Historians and Movie Lovers. This is not as good as The Big Combo (1955) or Gun Crazy (1950), but very few Films are. He was great at entertaining and messaging with a flat out frenzy of style and pomp that made His Movies, and this one is certainly no exception, quite different and much better than most.

    I do not believe I watched the whole thing. I tried. I really, really tried. I tried to like something of it but let's face it. This isn't Gary Cooper and this isn't High Noon and no one is going to Yuma. What a politicized mess. tell me something I don't already know. Bad guys are bad and good guys are good and bad girls are good too. Glad we got that straight. Now let's get on to the trashing of normal everyday folks to Dalton can be happy in his red diaper. Feel better now? Good. I think this one belongs back in the drawer. Back of the drawer. If you want to watch a western, there are many better ones readily available. This one is not worth the time. Sterling is better served in his other ventures and so are the others in the cast. Even if you only have one station and this is the only thing on, read a book. Rent Sparticus. Don't bother with this waste of film and effort all around.

    This movie is probably most well known for the unusual choice of weapon used by the hero in the final showdown, but as fun as that is, there's more to this movie than that. The plot is not complicated or even very original, and there are slow patches, but it has enough unique elements in it to keep the viewer interested. As in many westerns, the characters in this movie are archetypes. When confronted with a choice of action, the viewer can usually correctly predict what the characters will do. This could have been a bad thing, but the writing in this movie is intelligent enough to present the characters with choices that are not always clear-cut. For the good characters, sometimes the choice comes down to picking the lesser of two evils; interestingly, the same is true for the bad characters as well. Despite their archetypal nature, there is room for character development. In a scene near the end of the movie with no dialogue or action, the viewer is presented with a still life of a room, and from what is shown on screen and the character development that has occurred, we can tell what happened, why, and what the situation is now for the hero. Overall, an entertaining, non-standard western with some above average writing, and worth a viewing.

    A Swedish whaler comes to a Texas town to visit his father but learns the latter has been murdered. This is an unusual Western from Lewis, who directed the B-movie classic "Gun Crazy." It starts with a showdown between a gunfighter and a harpooner! and then fills in the story via flashbacks. Stanley Kubrick effectively used Hayden in "The Killing" and "Dr. Strangelove," but he was a limited actor who generally turned in wooden performances. In this film, that awkwardness actually fits in with his fish-out-of-water role. Faring better is Cabot as the heavy (literally and figuratively), but the best performance comes from Young as a black-clad gunslinger who looks and acts like Humphrey Bogart.

    This strange, surreal film is unique among westerns of the era. While it contains most of the standard western clich&eacute;s, every clich&eacute; has a twist. The music is bizarre and often doesn't seem to fit, but that just adds to the offbeat feel. The acting is odd but perfectly suited to the film. Hayden's take on a Swedish accent and speech patterns bounces from realistic to annoying to non-existent, but his performance is excellent, as is Cabot's. The story is riddled with moral dilemmas that give it surprising depth. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another B western. This movie has a quality that is difficult to describe. Strangely great.

    Terror in a Texas Town (1958) The first five minutes of this movie is fabulous a play of archetypes, with a showdown, some cattle breaking free and stampeding, a raging fire, and some close ups of sad faces lit by the flames. In fact, in the wide screen black and white, it seems most of all like a precursor to the spaghetti Westerns, dramatic and just a hair "arch" in its excess, music, photography, acting and all. It all takes place in a little Texan town called Prairie City. This is a great movie right off the bat, but it isn't sustained. It tries too hard sometimes, and unlike "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" it talks too much for its own good. There is an overweight bad man (Sebastian Cabot of all people) who has a maniacal laugh, a tough guy gunslinger (Ned Young) with a fast draw and a metal arm, and there is a stoic good guy (Sterling Hayden) who depends on his stoicism and morality to stand up against them. Men are strong, women are to be kept in bed (or so the gunslinger tells his dame), and life is hard. In addition to the wood frame one street town and the hardworking farmers there is the discovery of oil, and lots of it, an appropriate twist in this final chapter of the Wild West. The director is a favorite of mine, Joseph H. Lewis ("Gun Crazy" and "The Big Combo" both precede this one), and it has some of the same crudely cut archetypes and stiff dialog. But this is part of the style (he surely knew what he was doing), and adds to the blunt force of the story. There are moments of raw and brutal violence and sections of peaceful bucolic life. People are oddly realistic even if the movie isn't. This is a kind of warm up to about fifty episodes of a classic television show called "The Rifleman" that Lewis directed, playing with simple stories well told but quickly arranged. Sam Peckinpah initiated that show, and we can see some back and forth influence between the two directors. It is a bit odd to hear Sterling Hayden with a Swedish accent. He plays a kind of simple fellow, but good hearted, and neither quality is exactly useful in this rough town. Hayden ends up a caricature, and not a good one. He is filled with such strained affectations, and he plays a "good" person, but he doesn't sweep you into his cause because he's just plain weird. But of course he prevails, and the last five minutes is much like the first, and you see that justice is sometimes the hardest thing to achieve but you have to keep trying anyway. It's a strain, but an archetypal one.

    Good original western revolving around a murder and the unstoppable justice that follows in the shape of a determined Swedish immigrant. my oh my there was some lousy acting to behold here, with the exception of Hayden, Cabot and..... let's just call that last one "the bad guy"(Bogart lookalike). I must say i find the whale spear vs. a revolver kind of amusing, but actually quite plausible if you can believe it. The story ain't much but it aims to please. It is always satisfying to see the average Joe stand up against tyranny and evil s.o.b's. So by all means watch it if you enjoy old school western's that stand out a little from the rest.

    Dalton Trumbo's ideological script and Nedrick Young's complex hired killer drive this interestingly weird and elegant Western. Director Joseph Lewis brought immense skill to this work, as did cinematographer Ray Rennaban and editors Stefan Arnstan and Frank Sullivan. Gerald Fried's original score has the same minimalist intensity as the script and production. Several old-time actors with excellent skills play in this movie. I think anyone connected to this movie had to feel pride. Sterling Hayden, Carol Kelly, Eugene Mazola, and Sebastian Cabot play a bit more traditionally than Ned Young does, but that makes for interesting counterpoint. You never have a sense of haste in making this film. This is not a subtle work. It is an effective one.I rate it highly because for a small movie, it is a fine piece of work.

    Terror in a Texas Town has the look of a film that was made on the cheap over a long weekend but it's harpoon toting hero and quirky villain make it interesting enough to go the distance with. Swedish immigrant George Hansen comes to Texas with the intention of working on his father's farm. He arrives however to find out his father has been murdered by Johnny Crale a hired gun of greedy and treacherous oil man Ed Neil who is out to steal farmers oil rich property. When Hansen can't get any satisfaction from the law he takes it into his own hands. When you look at Terror's roster of black listed players (Dalton Trumbo,Sterling Hayden, Nedrick Young) you get the feeling this a desperate quickie trying to put food on the table but Trumbo and director Joseph Lewis give this generic western with a twist a lot more bite. Taken as microcosm Terror in a Texas Town takes a swipe at a corrupt capitalist society. The sheriff is in the oil man's pocket and wears his xenephobia on his sleeve thwarting any attempt by Hansen to get the justice he has a right to. The power of big oil flexing its muscle and influence in Terror eerily reflects the arrogance displayed today by BP and the Gulf oil spill that as I write has still not been remedied. Performances are unremarkable save for Young as the rusting gunslinger who does a Bogart/Marc Lawrence hybrid that is inconsistent but interesting. Everyone else looks like they may have had only one take to get it right. Still, Lewis is to be commended for his savvy decision of capturing audience interest by inserting some of the final scene into the film's opening. This B movie king certainly understood the public.

    Didn't know this was scripted by Dalton Trumbo , or by someone on his behalf let's say, due to the circumstances which surrounded the guy during the 50's. His script here is not particularly impressive , plot is quite dull indeed ,typical revenge history focused on the clash between the righteous and noble country boy and the hired gun whit conscience troubles who knows that the end of the road is getting closer for him . We have seen this history a million times , so accomplishments of this films are mostly on the visual side, the way it was beautifully shot in black and white , relying on the dark ambiances to make up for the lack of budget ...Lewis definitively knew how to do that . The whole tone of hopelessness and deception given to the film reminds me a bit of Ow Box Incident ( but that was a much better film ) The impression I get after having seen this is that with a tighter script the outcome could have been much better , ( for instance why Sterling and his father are using an harpoon ? it appears this was the only weapon they could find but it's clear that there are people in the village who have guns and ammunition ok maybe it's just a symbol ) Sterling never was a hell of an actor let's admit it. He was quite solid and managed to complete dozens of good films throughout his career but when it comes to acting he was not specially skilled . He knew to play though characters which made him a perfect choice for film noir and westerns , but don't ask him for much acting , his presence was enough . Problem here is that he had to play a Swedish character and his accent is a bit ridiculous , but his impressive presence and his stiff face contribute a lot to the elegiac tone of the film .

Problem here is that he had to play a Swedish character and his accent is a bit ridiculous , but his impressive presence and his stiff face contribute a lot to the elegiac tone of the film .

    The common man, in this respect a Whaler from Sweden, versus slick and soulless Capitalists. The greedy, rich Men representing the System can purchase fancy attire, and expensive and flashy weapons of destruction. But our lower class type of an immigrant sod buster dresses in plain clothes and is forced to use the tools of his trade to defend his honor and exact revenge. There are no subtle representations here and it is all framed like Artful arrogance and what this stylish B-Western presented is nothing less than one of the most unique and classy Proletariat Pictures from a decade that was full of mediocre meanderings from others by the wagon load. This Norish Western was the last for an unsung B-Movie Master Joseph H. Lewis and his underrated work was missed but not forgotten among Film Historians and Movie Lovers. This is not as good as The Big Combo (1955) or Gun Crazy (1950), but very few Films are. He was great at entertaining and messaging with a flat out frenzy of style and pomp that made His Movies, and this one is certainly no exception, quite different and much better than most.

    I do not believe I watched the whole thing. I tried. I really, really tried. I tried to like something of it but let's face it. This isn't Gary Cooper and this isn't High Noon and no one is going to Yuma. What a politicized mess. tell me something I don't already know. Bad guys are bad and good guys are good and bad girls are good too. Glad we got that straight. Now let's get on to the trashing of normal everyday folks to Dalton can be happy in his red diaper. Feel better now? Good. I think this one belongs back in the drawer. Back of the drawer. If you want to watch a western, there are many better ones readily available. This one is not worth the time. Sterling is better served in his other ventures and so are the others in the cast. Even if you only have one station and this is the only thing on, read a book. Rent Sparticus. Don't bother with this waste of film and effort all around.

    This movie is probably most well known for the unusual choice of weapon used by the hero in the final showdown, but as fun as that is, there's more to this movie than that. The plot is not complicated or even very original, and there are slow patches, but it has enough unique elements in it to keep the viewer interested. As in many westerns, the characters in this movie are archetypes. When confronted with a choice of action, the viewer can usually correctly predict what the characters will do. This could have been a bad thing, but the writing in this movie is intelligent enough to present the characters with choices that are not always clear-cut. For the good characters, sometimes the choice comes down to picking the lesser of two evils; interestingly, the same is true for the bad characters as well. Despite their archetypal nature, there is room for character development. In a scene near the end of the movie with no dialogue or action, the viewer is presented with a still life of a room, and from what is shown on screen and the character development that has occurred, we can tell what happened, why, and what the situation is now for the hero. Overall, an entertaining, non-standard western with some above average writing, and worth a viewing.

    A Swedish whaler comes to a Texas town to visit his father but learns the latter has been murdered. This is an unusual Western from Lewis, who directed the B-movie classic "Gun Crazy." It starts with a showdown between a gunfighter and a harpooner! and then fills in the story via flashbacks. Stanley Kubrick effectively used Hayden in "The Killing" and "Dr. Strangelove," but he was a limited actor who generally turned in wooden performances. In this film, that awkwardness actually fits in with his fish-out-of-water role. Faring better is Cabot as the heavy (literally and figuratively), but the best performance comes from Young as a black-clad gunslinger who looks and acts like Humphrey Bogart.

    This strange, surreal film is unique among westerns of the era. While it contains most of the standard western clich&eacute;s, every clich&eacute; has a twist. The music is bizarre and often doesn't seem to fit, but that just adds to the offbeat feel. The acting is odd but perfectly suited to the film. Hayden's take on a Swedish accent and speech patterns bounces from realistic to annoying to non-existent, but his performance is excellent, as is Cabot's. The story is riddled with moral dilemmas that give it surprising depth. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another B western. This movie has a quality that is difficult to describe. Strangely great.

    Terror in a Texas Town (1958) The first five minutes of this movie is fabulous a play of archetypes, with a showdown, some cattle breaking free and stampeding, a raging fire, and some close ups of sad faces lit by the flames. In fact, in the wide screen black and white, it seems most of all like a precursor to the spaghetti Westerns, dramatic and just a hair "arch" in its excess, music, photography, acting and all. It all takes place in a little Texan town called Prairie City. This is a great movie right off the bat, but it isn't sustained. It tries too hard sometimes, and unlike "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" it talks too much for its own good. There is an overweight bad man (Sebastian Cabot of all people) who has a maniacal laugh, a tough guy gunslinger (Ned Young) with a fast draw and a metal arm, and there is a stoic good guy (Sterling Hayden) who depends on his stoicism and morality to stand up against them. Men are strong, women are to be kept in bed (or so the gunslinger tells his dame), and life is hard. In addition to the wood frame one street town and the hardworking farmers there is the discovery of oil, and lots of it, an appropriate twist in this final chapter of the Wild West. The director is a favorite of mine, Joseph H. Lewis ("Gun Crazy" and "The Big Combo" both precede this one), and it has some of the same crudely cut archetypes and stiff dialog. But this is part of the style (he surely knew what he was doing), and adds to the blunt force of the story. There are moments of raw and brutal violence and sections of peaceful bucolic life. People are oddly realistic even if the movie isn't. This is a kind of warm up to about fifty episodes of a classic television show called "The Rifleman" that Lewis directed, playing with simple stories well told but quickly arranged. Sam Peckinpah initiated that show, and we can see some back and forth influence between the two directors. It is a bit odd to hear Sterling Hayden with a Swedish accent. He plays a kind of simple fellow, but good hearted, and neither quality is exactly useful in this rough town. Hayden ends up a caricature, and not a good one. He is filled with such strained affectations, and he plays a "good" person, but he doesn't sweep you into his cause because he's just plain weird. But of course he prevails, and the last five minutes is much like the first, and you see that justice is sometimes the hardest thing to achieve but you have to keep trying anyway. It's a strain, but an archetypal one.

    Good original western revolving around a murder and the unstoppable justice that follows in the shape of a determined Swedish immigrant. my oh my there was some lousy acting to behold here, with the exception of Hayden, Cabot and..... let's just call that last one "the bad guy"(Bogart lookalike). I must say i find the whale spear vs. a revolver kind of amusing, but actually quite plausible if you can believe it. The story ain't much but it aims to please. It is always satisfying to see the average Joe stand up against tyranny and evil s.o.b's. So by all means watch it if you enjoy old school western's that stand out a little from the rest.

    Dalton Trumbo's ideological script and Nedrick Young's complex hired killer drive this interestingly weird and elegant Western. Director Joseph Lewis brought immense skill to this work, as did cinematographer Ray Rennaban and editors Stefan Arnstan and Frank Sullivan. Gerald Fried's original score has the same minimalist intensity as the script and production. Several old-time actors with excellent skills play in this movie. I think anyone connected to this movie had to feel pride. Sterling Hayden, Carol Kelly, Eugene Mazola, and Sebastian Cabot play a bit more traditionally than Ned Young does, but that makes for interesting counterpoint. You never have a sense of haste in making this film. This is not a subtle work. It is an effective one.I rate it highly because for a small movie, it is a fine piece of work.

    Terror in a Texas Town has the look of a film that was made on the cheap over a long weekend but it's harpoon toting hero and quirky villain make it interesting enough to go the distance with. Swedish immigrant George Hansen comes to Texas with the intention of working on his father's farm. He arrives however to find out his father has been murdered by Johnny Crale a hired gun of greedy and treacherous oil man Ed Neil who is out to steal farmers oil rich property. When Hansen can't get any satisfaction from the law he takes it into his own hands. When you look at Terror's roster of black listed players (Dalton Trumbo,Sterling Hayden, Nedrick Young) you get the feeling this a desperate quickie trying to put food on the table but Trumbo and director Joseph Lewis give this generic western with a twist a lot more bite. Taken as microcosm Terror in a Texas Town takes a swipe at a corrupt capitalist society. The sheriff is in the oil man's pocket and wears his xenephobia on his sleeve thwarting any attempt by Hansen to get the justice he has a right to. The power of big oil flexing its muscle and influence in Terror eerily reflects the arrogance displayed today by BP and the Gulf oil spill that as I write has still not been remedied. Performances are unremarkable save for Young as the rusting gunslinger who does a Bogart/Marc Lawrence hybrid that is inconsistent but interesting. Everyone else looks like they may have had only one take to get it right. Still, Lewis is to be commended for his savvy decision of capturing audience interest by inserting some of the final scene into the film's opening. This B movie king certainly understood the public.

    Didn't know this was scripted by Dalton Trumbo , or by someone on his behalf let's say, due to the circumstances which surrounded the guy during the 50's. His script here is not particularly impressive , plot is quite dull indeed ,typical revenge history focused on the clash between the righteous and noble country boy and the hired gun whit conscience troubles who knows that the end of the road is getting closer for him . We have seen this history a million times , so accomplishments of this films are mostly on the visual side, the way it was beautifully shot in black and white , relying on the dark ambiances to make up for the lack of budget ...Lewis definitively knew how to do that . The whole tone of hopelessness and deception given to the film reminds me a bit of Ow Box Incident ( but that was a much better film ) The impression I get after having seen this is that with a tighter script the outcome could have been much better , ( for instance why Sterling and his father are using an harpoon ? it appears this was the only weapon they could find but it's clear that there are people in the village who have guns and ammunition ok maybe it's just a symbol ) Sterling never was a hell of an actor let's admit it. He was quite solid and managed to complete dozens of good films throughout his career but when it comes to acting he was not specially skilled . He knew to play though characters which made him a perfect choice for film noir and westerns , but don't ask him for much acting , his presence was enough . Problem here is that he had to play a Swedish character and his accent is a bit ridiculous , but his impressive presence and his stiff face contribute a lot to the elegiac tone of the film .
