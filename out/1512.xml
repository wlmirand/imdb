    Bringing the lessons learned from Italian neo-realism to Indian filmmaking, Satyajit Ray's first project was part one of what would become the famous "Apu" trilogy, "Pather Panchali" ("Song of the Little Road", 1955). Undoubtedly it laid the foundation of Ray's status as a cultural Indian icon. In neo-realistic fashion the three films were made on actual locations using an amateur cast, shot as close to reality as possible, and due to this approach they show all the unvarnished truths but also the charms found only on the street, addressing life itself. Direct, plain and simple the contained episodes shed light on poverty, anguish, loss and the unending struggle of man to justify his very own existence, the trials and tribulations to transcend one's self and the world one was born in. Central to the continuing story of all films is Apu, a coming of age Bengali boy with the bleakest imaginable prospects. His long journey takes him to many different places, nowhere he is truly at home except in books, and yet despite all that he's contended with the simplest things. But in all the ordeals he has to suffer from there's always a glimpse of hope, an impulse to go on. Until he reaches a dead end... Years after "Pather Panchali" and part two "Aparajito" ("The Unvanquished") Ray's conclusion of the series via "Apur Sansar" ("The World of Apu") is emotionally the strongest of the three installments. It already starts off with the weight of the first two films on the protagonist's shoulders, lets the now mature Apu question everything he has come to believe in and steers inevitably towards his destiny. Ray has also perfected his directorial techniques in the meantime, and the choices of actors to play an older and finally adult Apu are spot on. Rarely before has poetical realism been so devastatingly beautiful than in this jewel of Indian filmmaking, the pictures often speak for themselves. Like the recurring symbolic image of a train that accompanies us throughout the trilogy: first as something magical, then adventurous, even deadly. And it's there in the very last scene as well - as a reminder that roads go ever, ever on. And all a road requires is a first step.

    impressive. for delicacy, precise art of director, steps of nuances, splendid acting. for the atmosphere as spider web in wind. for few magnificent scenes. for silences. and, maybe, first, for its final message. part of a trilogy, it is , in same time, a subtle lesson about dreams, duty and love. about meetings as letters of self-definition. it is a Hindi story. but its sound is universal. and this is touching. because, more than a good performance, the film gives little clues about profound sense of things. Sharmila Tagore is extraordinary and the passing time is proof than this role was more than promise. Soumitra Chatterjee close the circle of his character searches. and he does more than a good job. its creation is really admirable.

    What bold, deliciously reckless storytelling! The young hero is penniless, lives in dirty little room above the railway tracks, owes the rent to his landlord and still, somehow, is a king among paupers. He has the gift of poetry that enchants everyone who gets in contact with him. He's invited, as guest, to a wedding and returns with the bride. Their marriage, under dire circumstances, is a prime example of happiness - till fate strikes and she dies giving birth to a boy. The father does not want to see the "little killer" of his wife and falls victim to a depression of several years. Till finally the beautiful little boy, his mother's image, and the estranged father reunite. - I liked the deep humanity and strong emotions of the story. The camera work is exquisite "poetical realism".

    The little boy who once chased trains across paddy fields with his elder sister now lives next to a bustling train track in grimy Calcutta. The central imagery of the Apu series has to be the Great Indian Railway. The last installment of the life of Apu, strings together many such visual ironies, that revealed to me at different phases of my life so far. I intend to watch it many more times because it has such an endearing quality to it. Apu, having grown up as an orphan without much income is very much his father from Pather Panchali. He dreams of making it big which he does confess in his autobiography/novel that is never materialised.The story of Apu is that of transitions.The last chapter is not glorified. It leaves a lot to the imagination for endless possibilities. Where does Apu go from here? Having lost most of his close ones, his sister, his father and his wife, it leaves you with a worry whether he would lose his son as well? But I am not an optimist, and thank God, there has not been a sequeal to this. I had watched Shyam Benegal question Ray about his conventional editing technique in one of his documentaries. I think Ray has used quite a few intelligent transitions/ morphs. One that comes to mind is the morph of the cinema screen into the window of the horse carriage where Apu and his wife enjoy an evening together as a couple. It is apparently legend that Ray carefully storyboarded every scene in the film but the strength of the film lies in its mundane everyday moments, sometimes making you wonder how difficult it must be to choreograph them and yet make them seem effortlessly natural? You never notice the camera in the film except at moments of confrontation. The rest of the film seems to be you living the life with Apu.

    The more times I watch this film it gets better and better. The story continues very much where the last one ends. Here we see Apu at University, getting very drunk, and shouting poetry late at night, and by happy accident, getting married. The early married scene are the best in the film. The circumstance of the marriage are hard to believe but with the magic of "Ray's India Cinema" the love between Apu and his beautiful young wife grows by then day. A child is born. And this is the spoiler, but, anyone who watches India films will know there is a death. I watch this film on DVD which I like because it gives me intimacy with the screen, but I know it should be watched in a packed out picture palace. You will not regard watching this film.

    This is the third and last entry into the Apu-trilogy and I must say that's definitely the strongest and most emotionally involving one. Things definitely get full circle in this movie, which makes the whole trilogy as a whole complete and this movie forms a fitting ending to it all. Thing that I really like and admire about this trilogy, is that all three movies basically tell a different story, even though it features the same main characters and it does very little else than simply following his life span. In the first movie he was only growing up, the second one was a coming of age story, while in this movie Apu truly becomes a man and has to start to take responsibility for his own life and that of his newly wed wife. For most part the movie is being a quite cute love-story, in which Apu and his wife truly start to fall in love with each other, only after they already got married, which had happened by pure 'chance', or faith if you will. It helps to make the movie a pleasant and emotionally involving one, in which you start to care for the characters, which was just not always the case with the previous movies. It makes the movie as a whole such a good and powerful one to follow. It's also a nicely paced movie, which is also not something I can really say about the previous movies as well. It's actually also being the shortest movie out of the trilogy, so perhaps this also has something to do with it as well. But of course you also have to give the director credit for that. When director Satyajit Ray started working on the trilogy, he was still a very inexperienced one but by the time of this movie, he had obviously gained more experience and also had the funding to back his movies up, which also must have helped him a lot. A really great ending to one fine Indian trilogy. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Apur Sansar is a film that delights in little things. In the beginning of the film Apu's apartment is a disheveled mess, like most bachelors'. But, within a few scenes of her appearance there, Aparna transforms it into a place where a woman calls home, by subtle decor. Yet, Ray never calls attention to this. It just happens naturally, and only an astute observer would notice; such as a scene where he is teaching her English, because that is the language that allows Bengalis to escape poverty. At other times, he lets romantic intimacy lead one to a change in Apu: there is a deft scene where Apu finds a hairpin between pillows, and then he sees his wife doing cleaning in a hallway, and tries to light a cigarette, only to find a note from her inside his cigarette pack stating that he promised to only smoke after eating. Later, a series of playful letters are exchange between the separated couple, when she is off to her parents' place to give birth. One can sense the delight and excitement Apu gets just from reading the words of his wife, even when interrupted by a co-worker or a man on a trolley. I doubt I've ever seen on screen love portrayed so well without any physical affection nor intercourse shown. Yet this is just an extension of the great human interactions Ray captures. Earlier, in the first sequence with Pulu, we get a sense of the depth of their friendship when, after a night on the town, the two men are returning to Apu's apartment and walking along train tracks at night. They are arguing over women, literature, and the camera just pulls back and leaves the two friends in the midst of their personal comity. Then, after Aparna has died, and Apu is bedridden with grief, Apu is seemingly brought back to reality by the screech of a train whistle- the very thing that, within the bounds of the trilogy, symbolize some greater horizon for him. Yet, we soon see that it is not a call to life that has roused him, but he seems to now be standing on tracks, waiting to be run over, until we learn that the wail we hear, when the camera moves up and away from Apu (as if to let his end come without voyeurism, and foreshadowing a similar scene of pain heard on a payphone in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, where the camera looks away from the protagonist who is being dismissed on the phone, by a woman he desires), is that from a pig whose leg has been crushed, not Apu. Such cinematic poesy and mastery are grace notes that abound in Apur Sansar, and make it such a fabulous work of art; and one with many more moments of insight and depth than these few herein described.. Oftentimes critics confuse the terms major and great, as if they were synonyms. They are not. There are great works of art that are small chamber pieces: think Woody Allen's Stardust Memories, Ingmar Bergman's The Silence, or Curse Of The Cat People. These films are gems, but contain large pieces of cosmic power in their small delineations. Then there are major films, that, while having good moments, and dealing with titanic dilemmas, miss greatness because they do not core deeply enough into things, despite their impact on the culture and their medium: think Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, or Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Then there are films that are both great and major, for they are technically, aesthetically, and intellectually great while having a major impact on the culture and cinema. These would be films like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kenji Mizoguchi's Sansho The Bailiff, and Taxi Driver. Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy- as a whole, or taken in bits, belongs to both classes. Apur Sansar not only has meaning, but imparts meaning to its viewers, not just of its own internal realities, but those which communicate individually to the percipient. Only humans can bring or gift meaning, for only we can comprehend it. The greatest of artists know this; yet, paradoxically, because it can be so difficult, so few even try to impart it in what they claim as their art. Satyajit Ray had no such worries, and one only wishes more filmmakers followed his lead, one which Apur Sansur so splendidly embodies.

    The World of Apu, or Apur Sansar if you want, is the third and final part of director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed Apu Trilogy, all of which features in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Apurba 'Apu' Kumar Ray (Soumitra Chatterjee) has grown up, he is now a jobless ex-student living in Calcutta, and he has vague ambition for his future to become a writer. His old school friend Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee) suggests he attends the wedding of a cousin named Aparna (Sharmila Tagore). However on the day of the wedding it turns out that the bride groom has a serious mental disorder, and wedding must go ahead or the bride is cursed. Apu shakes his head at the idea at first, but then he agrees for the sake of the curse thing to take the place of the groom, and he returns with Aparna to Calcutta. They do actually get on really well and are excited to be having their first child together, and Apu takes up a clerical job. Their growing affection however is cut short when Aparna tragically dies giving birth to their son, Kajal, and Apu retreats blaming the child for the birth of his wife. A few years later, Apu has become a bearded recluse, travelling across parts of India, only giving money for the care of Kajal (Alok Chakravarty) living with his grandparents. He throws away the manuscript of his novel he had been working on for years, and his friend Pulu finds Kajal lonely and uncared for, so he looks for Apu, working on a quarry. He advises Apu to take up his fatherly duty properly, and after initially refusing he reunites with his son, who does not care to see him. In the end, Apu plans to leave alone, but Kajal sees him preparing, he accepts his father as a friend, and they return together to Calcutta to start life afresh. Also starring Dhiresh Majumdar as Shashinarayan, Sefalika Devi as Shashinarayan's wife and Dhiren Ghosh as Landlord. The performances are all very well done considering that the cast consists of non-professional actors, and the story combined with good Indian music, a little English language and a marvellous director make this great drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!

    The World Of Apu is rich and contemplative, and a great, convincing affirmation. The story is set in India, where a would-be writer, stuck in a tedious clerical job, struggles to accept the son of his wife, who died in childbirth. The film is the last part of a monumental trilogy, and a sense that events have moved full circle over the three separate stories. This final episode brings a sense of closure for the members of a troubled family who have known immense hardship and struggle. The World Of Apu is a profound and deeply moving exploration of the human condition, exuding a transcendent wisdom rarely seen in cinema outside of the works of Yasujiro Ozu or Robert Bresson.

    I found Apur Sansar, the final part of the Apu Trilogy, every bit as superb as its prequels. I liked the pacing even better than its predecessors, as there was not a single moment that didn't keep me interested. Although the ending wasn't as powerful as its prequels, I thought it was a more hopeful and fitting ending for the saga. However, it did give me the feeling that I didn't want the story to end at all. Soumitra Chatterjee's debut performance as the adult Apu was truly Oscar-worthy (like Karuna Bannerjee who played his mother in the first two films) and a young Sharmila Tagore was also convincing in her debut performance as his wife. Overall, I'd say Apur Sansar is my second favourite in the Apu Trilogy, after Aparajito. Now that I've finally finished watching the Apu Trilogy, I must say this is probably the greatest film trilogy I've ever seen. Although it's a simple story about a country boy's growth to adulthood, it felt like I was watching a truly epic saga. Satyajit Ray really is one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century in my opinion. 10/10

At other times, he lets romantic intimacy lead one to a change in Apu: there is a deft scene where Apu finds a hairpin between pillows, and then he sees his wife doing cleaning in a hallway, and tries to light a cigarette, only to find a note from her inside his cigarette pack stating that he promised to only smoke after eating. Later, a series of playful letters are exchange between the separated couple, when she is off to her parents' place to give birth. One can sense the delight and excitement Apu gets just from reading the words of his wife, even when interrupted by a co-worker or a man on a trolley. I doubt I've ever seen on screen love portrayed so well without any physical affection nor intercourse shown. Yet this is just an extension of the great human interactions Ray captures. Earlier, in the first sequence with Pulu, we get a sense of the depth of their friendship when, after a night on the town, the two men are returning to Apu's apartment and walking along train tracks at night. They are arguing over women, literature, and the camera just pulls back and leaves the two friends in the midst of their personal comity. Then, after Aparna has died, and Apu is bedridden with grief, Apu is seemingly brought back to reality by the screech of a train whistle- the very thing that, within the bounds of the trilogy, symbolize some greater horizon for him. Yet, we soon see that it is not a call to life that has roused him, but he seems to now be standing on tracks, waiting to be run over, until we learn that the wail we hear, when the camera moves up and away from Apu (as if to let his end come without voyeurism, and foreshadowing a similar scene of pain heard on a payphone in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, where the camera looks away from the protagonist who is being dismissed on the phone, by a woman he desires), is that from a pig whose leg has been crushed, not Apu. Such cinematic poesy and mastery are grace notes that abound in Apur Sansar, and make it such a fabulous work of art; and one with many more moments of insight and depth than these few herein described.. Oftentimes critics confuse the terms major and great, as if they were synonyms. They are not. There are great works of art that are small chamber pieces: think Woody Allen's Stardust Memories, Ingmar Bergman's The Silence, or Curse Of The Cat People. These films are gems, but contain large pieces of cosmic power in their small delineations. Then there are major films, that, while having good moments, and dealing with titanic dilemmas, miss greatness because they do not core deeply enough into things, despite their impact on the culture and their medium: think Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, or Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Then there are films that are both great and major, for they are technically, aesthetically, and intellectually great while having a major impact on the culture and cinema. These would be films like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kenji Mizoguchi's Sansho The Bailiff, and Taxi Driver. Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy- as a whole, or taken in bits, belongs to both classes. Apur Sansar not only has meaning, but imparts meaning to its viewers, not just of its own internal realities, but those which communicate individually to the percipient. Only humans can bring or gift meaning, for only we can comprehend it. The greatest of artists know this; yet, paradoxically, because it can be so difficult, so few even try to impart it in what they claim as their art. Satyajit Ray had no such worries, and one only wishes more filmmakers followed his lead, one which Apur Sansur so splendidly embodies.

    The World of Apu, or Apur Sansar if you want, is the third and final part of director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed Apu Trilogy, all of which features in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Apurba 'Apu' Kumar Ray (Soumitra Chatterjee) has grown up, he is now a jobless ex-student living in Calcutta, and he has vague ambition for his future to become a writer. His old school friend Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee) suggests he attends the wedding of a cousin named Aparna (Sharmila Tagore). However on the day of the wedding it turns out that the bride groom has a serious mental disorder, and wedding must go ahead or the bride is cursed. Apu shakes his head at the idea at first, but then he agrees for the sake of the curse thing to take the place of the groom, and he returns with Aparna to Calcutta. They do actually get on really well and are excited to be having their first child together, and Apu takes up a clerical job. Their growing affection however is cut short when Aparna tragically dies giving birth to their son, Kajal, and Apu retreats blaming the child for the birth of his wife. A few years later, Apu has become a bearded recluse, travelling across parts of India, only giving money for the care of Kajal (Alok Chakravarty) living with his grandparents. He throws away the manuscript of his novel he had been working on for years, and his friend Pulu finds Kajal lonely and uncared for, so he looks for Apu, working on a quarry. He advises Apu to take up his fatherly duty properly, and after initially refusing he reunites with his son, who does not care to see him. In the end, Apu plans to leave alone, but Kajal sees him preparing, he accepts his father as a friend, and they return together to Calcutta to start life afresh. Also starring Dhiresh Majumdar as Shashinarayan, Sefalika Devi as Shashinarayan's wife and Dhiren Ghosh as Landlord. The performances are all very well done considering that the cast consists of non-professional actors, and the story combined with good Indian music, a little English language and a marvellous director make this great drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!

    The World Of Apu is rich and contemplative, and a great, convincing affirmation. The story is set in India, where a would-be writer, stuck in a tedious clerical job, struggles to accept the son of his wife, who died in childbirth. The film is the last part of a monumental trilogy, and a sense that events have moved full circle over the three separate stories. This final episode brings a sense of closure for the members of a troubled family who have known immense hardship and struggle. The World Of Apu is a profound and deeply moving exploration of the human condition, exuding a transcendent wisdom rarely seen in cinema outside of the works of Yasujiro Ozu or Robert Bresson.

    I found Apur Sansar, the final part of the Apu Trilogy, every bit as superb as its prequels. I liked the pacing even better than its predecessors, as there was not a single moment that didn't keep me interested. Although the ending wasn't as powerful as its prequels, I thought it was a more hopeful and fitting ending for the saga. However, it did give me the feeling that I didn't want the story to end at all. Soumitra Chatterjee's debut performance as the adult Apu was truly Oscar-worthy (like Karuna Bannerjee who played his mother in the first two films) and a young Sharmila Tagore was also convincing in her debut performance as his wife. Overall, I'd say Apur Sansar is my second favourite in the Apu Trilogy, after Aparajito. Now that I've finally finished watching the Apu Trilogy, I must say this is probably the greatest film trilogy I've ever seen. Although it's a simple story about a country boy's growth to adulthood, it felt like I was watching a truly epic saga. Satyajit Ray really is one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century in my opinion. 10/10

    Bringing the lessons learned from Italian neo-realism to Indian filmmaking, Satyajit Ray's first project was part one of what would become the famous "Apu" trilogy, "Pather Panchali" ("Song of the Little Road", 1955). Undoubtedly it laid the foundation of Ray's status as a cultural Indian icon. In neo-realistic fashion the three films were made on actual locations using an amateur cast, shot as close to reality as possible, and due to this approach they show all the unvarnished truths but also the charms found only on the street, addressing life itself. Direct, plain and simple the contained episodes shed light on poverty, anguish, loss and the unending struggle of man to justify his very own existence, the trials and tribulations to transcend one's self and the world one was born in. Central to the continuing story of all films is Apu, a coming of age Bengali boy with the bleakest imaginable prospects. His long journey takes him to many different places, nowhere he is truly at home except in books, and yet despite all that he's contended with the simplest things. But in all the ordeals he has to suffer from there's always a glimpse of hope, an impulse to go on. Until he reaches a dead end... Years after "Pather Panchali" and part two "Aparajito" ("The Unvanquished") Ray's conclusion of the series via "Apur Sansar" ("The World of Apu") is emotionally the strongest of the three installments. It already starts off with the weight of the first two films on the protagonist's shoulders, lets the now mature Apu question everything he has come to believe in and steers inevitably towards his destiny. Ray has also perfected his directorial techniques in the meantime, and the choices of actors to play an older and finally adult Apu are spot on. Rarely before has poetical realism been so devastatingly beautiful than in this jewel of Indian filmmaking, the pictures often speak for themselves. Like the recurring symbolic image of a train that accompanies us throughout the trilogy: first as something magical, then adventurous, even deadly. And it's there in the very last scene as well - as a reminder that roads go ever, ever on. And all a road requires is a first step.

    impressive. for delicacy, precise art of director, steps of nuances, splendid acting. for the atmosphere as spider web in wind. for few magnificent scenes. for silences. and, maybe, first, for its final message. part of a trilogy, it is , in same time, a subtle lesson about dreams, duty and love. about meetings as letters of self-definition. it is a Hindi story. but its sound is universal. and this is touching. because, more than a good performance, the film gives little clues about profound sense of things. Sharmila Tagore is extraordinary and the passing time is proof than this role was more than promise. Soumitra Chatterjee close the circle of his character searches. and he does more than a good job. its creation is really admirable.

    What bold, deliciously reckless storytelling! The young hero is penniless, lives in dirty little room above the railway tracks, owes the rent to his landlord and still, somehow, is a king among paupers. He has the gift of poetry that enchants everyone who gets in contact with him. He's invited, as guest, to a wedding and returns with the bride. Their marriage, under dire circumstances, is a prime example of happiness - till fate strikes and she dies giving birth to a boy. The father does not want to see the "little killer" of his wife and falls victim to a depression of several years. Till finally the beautiful little boy, his mother's image, and the estranged father reunite. - I liked the deep humanity and strong emotions of the story. The camera work is exquisite "poetical realism".

    The little boy who once chased trains across paddy fields with his elder sister now lives next to a bustling train track in grimy Calcutta. The central imagery of the Apu series has to be the Great Indian Railway. The last installment of the life of Apu, strings together many such visual ironies, that revealed to me at different phases of my life so far. I intend to watch it many more times because it has such an endearing quality to it. Apu, having grown up as an orphan without much income is very much his father from Pather Panchali. He dreams of making it big which he does confess in his autobiography/novel that is never materialised.The story of Apu is that of transitions.The last chapter is not glorified. It leaves a lot to the imagination for endless possibilities. Where does Apu go from here? Having lost most of his close ones, his sister, his father and his wife, it leaves you with a worry whether he would lose his son as well? But I am not an optimist, and thank God, there has not been a sequeal to this. I had watched Shyam Benegal question Ray about his conventional editing technique in one of his documentaries. I think Ray has used quite a few intelligent transitions/ morphs. One that comes to mind is the morph of the cinema screen into the window of the horse carriage where Apu and his wife enjoy an evening together as a couple. It is apparently legend that Ray carefully storyboarded every scene in the film but the strength of the film lies in its mundane everyday moments, sometimes making you wonder how difficult it must be to choreograph them and yet make them seem effortlessly natural? You never notice the camera in the film except at moments of confrontation. The rest of the film seems to be you living the life with Apu.

    The more times I watch this film it gets better and better. The story continues very much where the last one ends. Here we see Apu at University, getting very drunk, and shouting poetry late at night, and by happy accident, getting married. The early married scene are the best in the film. The circumstance of the marriage are hard to believe but with the magic of "Ray's India Cinema" the love between Apu and his beautiful young wife grows by then day. A child is born. And this is the spoiler, but, anyone who watches India films will know there is a death. I watch this film on DVD which I like because it gives me intimacy with the screen, but I know it should be watched in a packed out picture palace. You will not regard watching this film.

    This is the third and last entry into the Apu-trilogy and I must say that's definitely the strongest and most emotionally involving one. Things definitely get full circle in this movie, which makes the whole trilogy as a whole complete and this movie forms a fitting ending to it all. Thing that I really like and admire about this trilogy, is that all three movies basically tell a different story, even though it features the same main characters and it does very little else than simply following his life span. In the first movie he was only growing up, the second one was a coming of age story, while in this movie Apu truly becomes a man and has to start to take responsibility for his own life and that of his newly wed wife. For most part the movie is being a quite cute love-story, in which Apu and his wife truly start to fall in love with each other, only after they already got married, which had happened by pure 'chance', or faith if you will. It helps to make the movie a pleasant and emotionally involving one, in which you start to care for the characters, which was just not always the case with the previous movies. It makes the movie as a whole such a good and powerful one to follow. It's also a nicely paced movie, which is also not something I can really say about the previous movies as well. It's actually also being the shortest movie out of the trilogy, so perhaps this also has something to do with it as well. But of course you also have to give the director credit for that. When director Satyajit Ray started working on the trilogy, he was still a very inexperienced one but by the time of this movie, he had obviously gained more experience and also had the funding to back his movies up, which also must have helped him a lot. A really great ending to one fine Indian trilogy. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Apur Sansar is a film that delights in little things. In the beginning of the film Apu's apartment is a disheveled mess, like most bachelors'. But, within a few scenes of her appearance there, Aparna transforms it into a place where a woman calls home, by subtle decor. Yet, Ray never calls attention to this. It just happens naturally, and only an astute observer would notice; such as a scene where he is teaching her English, because that is the language that allows Bengalis to escape poverty. At other times, he lets romantic intimacy lead one to a change in Apu: there is a deft scene where Apu finds a hairpin between pillows, and then he sees his wife doing cleaning in a hallway, and tries to light a cigarette, only to find a note from her inside his cigarette pack stating that he promised to only smoke after eating.
