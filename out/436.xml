    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here.

In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here.

In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

    John Landis directs this popular horror/comedy about two backpacking Americans who are attacked on the moors of England by a werewolf. One dies, but the other survives, only to discover to his horror that he is now cursed with being a werewolf himself, and his friend really isn't all that dead... Released the same year as "The Howling", this does have impressive makeup F/X, but almost nothing else to recommend it, being an exceptionally violent, crass, and heartless film, that keeps everyone at arm's length throughout, entirely dependent on the F/X and shock sequences to keep the viewer interested, which didn't work on me. It ends so abruptly that, even though you're glad this unsavory film is over, you still can't quite believe it.

    Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. "An American Werewolf In London" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for "fish out of water" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass. The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like "The Wolfman". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in "The Howling". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO. As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. "An American Werewolf In London" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.

    Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind. David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.

So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away. There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two. Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion. And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one. I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.

    I don't know what I expected from this film, but I will say I found it somewhat surprising. Perhaps I just expected a much cheesier, more over- the-top violent, very crazy werewolf film. But not really. I mean, the violence doesn't start until an hour into the film, and the fact that it was able to make the four before it very well done, done with the images David would see, was very well done. The transformation scene was absolutely amazing, as is the last act. The make-up is incredible as well, making it seem incredibly well done and orchestrated. The acting is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, this is definitely recommended and lives up to the hype.

    American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!

    This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the "The Wolfman" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in "An American Werewolf in London". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.

    I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the resultas we've seen in recent yearsis often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all. And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true "emotion" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing. After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friendswho are backpacking across Europestumble upon a shady pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the clich&eacute; turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other. The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair. Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night. As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly "proper" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario. The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story quite simplylags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise. If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.

    David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.

    From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres. An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work. And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot. An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.

    ...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon "Animal House" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man." The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after. Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior release of Joe Dante's "The Howling" and Michael Wadleigh's "Wolfen," but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for "Heartbeeps"), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often. Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David "I'm a Pepper!" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin "After Hours" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny "Logan's Run" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John "Fatherland" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian "Alien3" Glover and David "Pirates of the Caribbean" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank "The Dark Crystal" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only "bad" actors are the ones in "See You Next Wednesday," the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means. Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer "too many to pick just one" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick "you have to ask?" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert "Thriller" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Moon" to the edgy jangle of CCR's "Bad Moon Rising" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop "Blue Moon" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about "American Werewolf in London." I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do. You won't regret it.
