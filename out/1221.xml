    I've always appreciated this film for its honest look at how insidious alcoholism is and how it devastates those around the addict. I watched it again on a lazy Saturday afternoon and, despite its flaws, its an excellent film and a great look at how alcoholism is a family disease. Meg Ryan's Alice is an alcoholic in a comfortable though unhealthy marriage with Andy Garcia's Michael, an enabler and rescuer. Alice hits rock bottom and heads off to detox. The family struggles while she is away, but still struggles when Alice gets back and fights to stay clean and sober. This is one of the greatest strengths of the film. Becoming sober is not the hard part. Staying sober is. Learning to live life sober is incredibly challenging. Meg Ryan gives a masterful performance in this. However, on re-viewing, I really appreciated the nuances of Andy Garcia's performance. Michael clearly finds meaning in helping and fixing all the problems around him. However, when Alice is sober and he finds he doesn't need to rescue her anymore, he is lost, angry, disappointed, and hurt. His speech at the Al Anon meeting when he admits that he feels pain seeing his wife doing so well without his help is powerful. The child actresses are great, particularly Tina Majorino. I wish they would have delved a bit more into how mom's alcoholism affected the kids. Also, Michael's speech at the very end is cringeworthy, sugarcoating what is otherwise an honest and very real portrayal of addiction and recovery.

    OK it is hard for me to see such a masterpiece with an average rating because these kind of performances don't come along everyday. Personally I think this picture should have been nominated for best film of the year. All the performances in the film were top notch even the kids. When I watch this movie, I almost feel like I am in the theater watching a play. The interaction is so intense and skillful. Andy Garcia also should have gotten just as much praise as Meg Ryan both performances were outstanding. Sometimes I think he gets overlooked because he's so hot but yes this man's acting was amazing especially in the main argument scene. In any case, so sickening when a film like this isn't recognized to the full extent of it's greatness. Such a powerful and beautiful contribution to the art of film.

    Just saw this movie for the first time and it had me cry so much. I know drama makes better impact on people's thoughts about a movie, but I truly never likes drama as it makes me feel sad about life. The degree that Garcia loves Ryan just terrifies the theory of letting love go. He never gives up in the end but we are not supposed to pursue love like that. Hollywood movies most go with happy endings although it's predictable but it does not break my heart over and over again and does not tear my belief about goods always deserves the best. no more drama...

    In my 40 years of active involvement with recovery programs for family members either addicted to alcohol, or adversely affected by someone else's drinking, this movie 'tells it like it is' better than the majority of other movies I've seen that dealt with similar issues - "I'll Cry Tomorrow'(Susan Hayward),'Days of Wine and Roses'(Lee Remick/Jack Lemmon), 'Bill's Story' (James Gardner) and the Hallmark production of "Love is Never Enough" (Lois Wilson story) left a lot out of the real impact of physical, emotional, psychological and social abuse or damage suffered by alcoholic relationships. This movie depicted a superb example of the pain, confusion, guilt, denial and resistance to change by both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic . . . and the damaging impact to the children and other close associates. The acting by the cast, and especially the children, was phenomenal. The mention and portrayal of an Al-Anon Family Group meeting for the family being affected by either the actively drinking or the new sobriety of an alcoholic was well revealed for the viewer. The final scene was the only part that was 'out of character' for an AA or Al-Anon person at a meeting. All else was 'on target'. 'Thanks for letting me share.' V

    Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a "closet" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the "party mood" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a "Betty Ford" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a "good cry", for it has wonderful cathartic elements.

    I really hated this film. I quite liked the beginning when Meg Ryan descended from bubbly to downright alcoholic but then the rest of the film was just completely lost on me. First and foremost, I find it a failure in the script that the story focused entirely on the relationship between the two grown ups and neglected the children. Personally, I think this would have been the more interesting story. But secondly, I just didn't get what Garcia's character was supposed to have done wrong. I honestly didn't although I was prepared to. So he may have been a macho but I saw him as being portrayed as supportive and a victim of her alcoholism just as the rest of the family. Why he should be partly responsible for it is beyond me as it was never properly explained.

    WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a searing and emotional look at how alcoholism manages to leave a family in shreds and how they struggle to put themselves back together again. Meg Ryan, in the performance of her career, dominates the screen with her powerhouse portrayal of Alice, a wife, mother, and career woman whose secret drinking is slowly and methodically destroying her life. The film chronicles Alice's journey as she hits her bottom, enters rehab, finishes rehab, and then tries to resume the life she left before rehab and discovers it's not as simple as she thinks. Andy Garcia is equally solid as Michael, Alice's sensitive and loving husband who finds out what real powerlessness is as he watches Alice fall apart and is introduced to a new kind of powerlessness when Alice returns home with a new attitude and new friends she made during her recovery process. Lots of great films have been made over the years about alcoholism but what makes this one stand out is that it not only deals with the alcoholism and the rehabilitation process, but it more importantly shows what happens when the alcoholic tries to resume their old life, slowing coming to the realization that it is no longer their old life anymore because they now have to face it sober. It also approaches the subject from the angle of the alcoholic's loved ones as we see Garcia's Michael struggle with the new person Alice has become and finds his only outlet for his frustration in Al-Anon meetings, where he finally realizes he is not alone. Luis Madoki's sensitive direction is also an asset but this film works mainly thanks to a well-rounded screenplay and the sterling performances by Andy Garcia and especially Meg Ryan, in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Don't miss this one.

    Less than powerful film about the traumas a young family experiences when one of the adults becomes an alcoholic and goes through the very demanding de-toxication program. Meg Ryan expands her repertoire with a solid performance as alcoholic Alice Green, a young woman who knows that her addiction is tearing her family apart, as she feels helpless to do anything at all. Andy Garcia is not as convincing though, and just doesn't sit right as the leading man, a husband who, however concerned, can't seem to prevent his marriage from self destructing. Luis Mandoki does manage some strong emotional scenes as director especially when the family's two young daughters are involved, yet he is unable to create a consistent and moving drama with Ronald Bass and Al Franken's script. "When a Man Loves a Woman" has a weak beginning, and unfortunately tends to lapse back into the uninspired groove too often. A harsher, more realistic ending may also have helped. Certainly not a complete waste of time, but never constantly hard hitting or disturbing enough to have the desired effect. Also known in the U.S. as "Significant Other". PS I personally struggled with much of the enunciation throughout the movie and consequently missed several lines. Saturday August 13, 1994 - Greater Union Melbourne

    I have to disagree with the critics once again. This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan). Andy Garcia on the other hand was totally miss-cast for the role in my opinion (come on critics, before giving up all those stars, can't you imagine the acting in such a movie by let's say... Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics). This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser... How politically correct can you get? No, definitely not for me...

The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser... How politically correct can you get? No, definitely not for me...

    I've always appreciated this film for its honest look at how insidious alcoholism is and how it devastates those around the addict. I watched it again on a lazy Saturday afternoon and, despite its flaws, its an excellent film and a great look at how alcoholism is a family disease. Meg Ryan's Alice is an alcoholic in a comfortable though unhealthy marriage with Andy Garcia's Michael, an enabler and rescuer. Alice hits rock bottom and heads off to detox. The family struggles while she is away, but still struggles when Alice gets back and fights to stay clean and sober. This is one of the greatest strengths of the film. Becoming sober is not the hard part. Staying sober is. Learning to live life sober is incredibly challenging. Meg Ryan gives a masterful performance in this. However, on re-viewing, I really appreciated the nuances of Andy Garcia's performance. Michael clearly finds meaning in helping and fixing all the problems around him. However, when Alice is sober and he finds he doesn't need to rescue her anymore, he is lost, angry, disappointed, and hurt. His speech at the Al Anon meeting when he admits that he feels pain seeing his wife doing so well without his help is powerful. The child actresses are great, particularly Tina Majorino. I wish they would have delved a bit more into how mom's alcoholism affected the kids. Also, Michael's speech at the very end is cringeworthy, sugarcoating what is otherwise an honest and very real portrayal of addiction and recovery.

    OK it is hard for me to see such a masterpiece with an average rating because these kind of performances don't come along everyday. Personally I think this picture should have been nominated for best film of the year. All the performances in the film were top notch even the kids. When I watch this movie, I almost feel like I am in the theater watching a play. The interaction is so intense and skillful. Andy Garcia also should have gotten just as much praise as Meg Ryan both performances were outstanding. Sometimes I think he gets overlooked because he's so hot but yes this man's acting was amazing especially in the main argument scene. In any case, so sickening when a film like this isn't recognized to the full extent of it's greatness. Such a powerful and beautiful contribution to the art of film.

    Just saw this movie for the first time and it had me cry so much. I know drama makes better impact on people's thoughts about a movie, but I truly never likes drama as it makes me feel sad about life. The degree that Garcia loves Ryan just terrifies the theory of letting love go. He never gives up in the end but we are not supposed to pursue love like that. Hollywood movies most go with happy endings although it's predictable but it does not break my heart over and over again and does not tear my belief about goods always deserves the best. no more drama...

    In my 40 years of active involvement with recovery programs for family members either addicted to alcohol, or adversely affected by someone else's drinking, this movie 'tells it like it is' better than the majority of other movies I've seen that dealt with similar issues - "I'll Cry Tomorrow'(Susan Hayward),'Days of Wine and Roses'(Lee Remick/Jack Lemmon), 'Bill's Story' (James Gardner) and the Hallmark production of "Love is Never Enough" (Lois Wilson story) left a lot out of the real impact of physical, emotional, psychological and social abuse or damage suffered by alcoholic relationships. This movie depicted a superb example of the pain, confusion, guilt, denial and resistance to change by both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic . . . and the damaging impact to the children and other close associates. The acting by the cast, and especially the children, was phenomenal. The mention and portrayal of an Al-Anon Family Group meeting for the family being affected by either the actively drinking or the new sobriety of an alcoholic was well revealed for the viewer. The final scene was the only part that was 'out of character' for an AA or Al-Anon person at a meeting. All else was 'on target'. 'Thanks for letting me share.' V

    Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a "closet" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the "party mood" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a "Betty Ford" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a "good cry", for it has wonderful cathartic elements.

    I really hated this film. I quite liked the beginning when Meg Ryan descended from bubbly to downright alcoholic but then the rest of the film was just completely lost on me. First and foremost, I find it a failure in the script that the story focused entirely on the relationship between the two grown ups and neglected the children. Personally, I think this would have been the more interesting story. But secondly, I just didn't get what Garcia's character was supposed to have done wrong. I honestly didn't although I was prepared to. So he may have been a macho but I saw him as being portrayed as supportive and a victim of her alcoholism just as the rest of the family. Why he should be partly responsible for it is beyond me as it was never properly explained.

    WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a searing and emotional look at how alcoholism manages to leave a family in shreds and how they struggle to put themselves back together again. Meg Ryan, in the performance of her career, dominates the screen with her powerhouse portrayal of Alice, a wife, mother, and career woman whose secret drinking is slowly and methodically destroying her life. The film chronicles Alice's journey as she hits her bottom, enters rehab, finishes rehab, and then tries to resume the life she left before rehab and discovers it's not as simple as she thinks. Andy Garcia is equally solid as Michael, Alice's sensitive and loving husband who finds out what real powerlessness is as he watches Alice fall apart and is introduced to a new kind of powerlessness when Alice returns home with a new attitude and new friends she made during her recovery process. Lots of great films have been made over the years about alcoholism but what makes this one stand out is that it not only deals with the alcoholism and the rehabilitation process, but it more importantly shows what happens when the alcoholic tries to resume their old life, slowing coming to the realization that it is no longer their old life anymore because they now have to face it sober. It also approaches the subject from the angle of the alcoholic's loved ones as we see Garcia's Michael struggle with the new person Alice has become and finds his only outlet for his frustration in Al-Anon meetings, where he finally realizes he is not alone. Luis Madoki's sensitive direction is also an asset but this film works mainly thanks to a well-rounded screenplay and the sterling performances by Andy Garcia and especially Meg Ryan, in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Don't miss this one.

    Less than powerful film about the traumas a young family experiences when one of the adults becomes an alcoholic and goes through the very demanding de-toxication program. Meg Ryan expands her repertoire with a solid performance as alcoholic Alice Green, a young woman who knows that her addiction is tearing her family apart, as she feels helpless to do anything at all. Andy Garcia is not as convincing though, and just doesn't sit right as the leading man, a husband who, however concerned, can't seem to prevent his marriage from self destructing. Luis Mandoki does manage some strong emotional scenes as director especially when the family's two young daughters are involved, yet he is unable to create a consistent and moving drama with Ronald Bass and Al Franken's script. "When a Man Loves a Woman" has a weak beginning, and unfortunately tends to lapse back into the uninspired groove too often. A harsher, more realistic ending may also have helped. Certainly not a complete waste of time, but never constantly hard hitting or disturbing enough to have the desired effect. Also known in the U.S. as "Significant Other". PS I personally struggled with much of the enunciation throughout the movie and consequently missed several lines. Saturday August 13, 1994 - Greater Union Melbourne

    I have to disagree with the critics once again. This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan). Andy Garcia on the other hand was totally miss-cast for the role in my opinion (come on critics, before giving up all those stars, can't you imagine the acting in such a movie by let's say... Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics). This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation.

Meg Ryan's Alice is an alcoholic in a comfortable though unhealthy marriage with Andy Garcia's Michael, an enabler and rescuer. Alice hits rock bottom and heads off to detox. The family struggles while she is away, but still struggles when Alice gets back and fights to stay clean and sober. This is one of the greatest strengths of the film. Becoming sober is not the hard part. Staying sober is. Learning to live life sober is incredibly challenging. Meg Ryan gives a masterful performance in this. However, on re-viewing, I really appreciated the nuances of Andy Garcia's performance. Michael clearly finds meaning in helping and fixing all the problems around him. However, when Alice is sober and he finds he doesn't need to rescue her anymore, he is lost, angry, disappointed, and hurt. His speech at the Al Anon meeting when he admits that he feels pain seeing his wife doing so well without his help is powerful. The child actresses are great, particularly Tina Majorino. I wish they would have delved a bit more into how mom's alcoholism affected the kids. Also, Michael's speech at the very end is cringeworthy, sugarcoating what is otherwise an honest and very real portrayal of addiction and recovery.

    OK it is hard for me to see such a masterpiece with an average rating because these kind of performances don't come along everyday. Personally I think this picture should have been nominated for best film of the year. All the performances in the film were top notch even the kids. When I watch this movie, I almost feel like I am in the theater watching a play. The interaction is so intense and skillful. Andy Garcia also should have gotten just as much praise as Meg Ryan both performances were outstanding. Sometimes I think he gets overlooked because he's so hot but yes this man's acting was amazing especially in the main argument scene. In any case, so sickening when a film like this isn't recognized to the full extent of it's greatness. Such a powerful and beautiful contribution to the art of film.

    Just saw this movie for the first time and it had me cry so much. I know drama makes better impact on people's thoughts about a movie, but I truly never likes drama as it makes me feel sad about life. The degree that Garcia loves Ryan just terrifies the theory of letting love go. He never gives up in the end but we are not supposed to pursue love like that. Hollywood movies most go with happy endings although it's predictable but it does not break my heart over and over again and does not tear my belief about goods always deserves the best. no more drama...

    In my 40 years of active involvement with recovery programs for family members either addicted to alcohol, or adversely affected by someone else's drinking, this movie 'tells it like it is' better than the majority of other movies I've seen that dealt with similar issues - "I'll Cry Tomorrow'(Susan Hayward),'Days of Wine and Roses'(Lee Remick/Jack Lemmon), 'Bill's Story' (James Gardner) and the Hallmark production of "Love is Never Enough" (Lois Wilson story) left a lot out of the real impact of physical, emotional, psychological and social abuse or damage suffered by alcoholic relationships. This movie depicted a superb example of the pain, confusion, guilt, denial and resistance to change by both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic . . . and the damaging impact to the children and other close associates. The acting by the cast, and especially the children, was phenomenal. The mention and portrayal of an Al-Anon Family Group meeting for the family being affected by either the actively drinking or the new sobriety of an alcoholic was well revealed for the viewer. The final scene was the only part that was 'out of character' for an AA or Al-Anon person at a meeting. All else was 'on target'. 'Thanks for letting me share.' V

    Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a "closet" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the "party mood" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a "Betty Ford" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a "good cry", for it has wonderful cathartic elements.

    I really hated this film. I quite liked the beginning when Meg Ryan descended from bubbly to downright alcoholic but then the rest of the film was just completely lost on me. First and foremost, I find it a failure in the script that the story focused entirely on the relationship between the two grown ups and neglected the children. Personally, I think this would have been the more interesting story. But secondly, I just didn't get what Garcia's character was supposed to have done wrong. I honestly didn't although I was prepared to. So he may have been a macho but I saw him as being portrayed as supportive and a victim of her alcoholism just as the rest of the family. Why he should be partly responsible for it is beyond me as it was never properly explained.

    WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a searing and emotional look at how alcoholism manages to leave a family in shreds and how they struggle to put themselves back together again. Meg Ryan, in the performance of her career, dominates the screen with her powerhouse portrayal of Alice, a wife, mother, and career woman whose secret drinking is slowly and methodically destroying her life. The film chronicles Alice's journey as she hits her bottom, enters rehab, finishes rehab, and then tries to resume the life she left before rehab and discovers it's not as simple as she thinks. Andy Garcia is equally solid as Michael, Alice's sensitive and loving husband who finds out what real powerlessness is as he watches Alice fall apart and is introduced to a new kind of powerlessness when Alice returns home with a new attitude and new friends she made during her recovery process. Lots of great films have been made over the years about alcoholism but what makes this one stand out is that it not only deals with the alcoholism and the rehabilitation process, but it more importantly shows what happens when the alcoholic tries to resume their old life, slowing coming to the realization that it is no longer their old life anymore because they now have to face it sober. It also approaches the subject from the angle of the alcoholic's loved ones as we see Garcia's Michael struggle with the new person Alice has become and finds his only outlet for his frustration in Al-Anon meetings, where he finally realizes he is not alone. Luis Madoki's sensitive direction is also an asset but this film works mainly thanks to a well-rounded screenplay and the sterling performances by Andy Garcia and especially Meg Ryan, in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Don't miss this one.

    Less than powerful film about the traumas a young family experiences when one of the adults becomes an alcoholic and goes through the very demanding de-toxication program. Meg Ryan expands her repertoire with a solid performance as alcoholic Alice Green, a young woman who knows that her addiction is tearing her family apart, as she feels helpless to do anything at all. Andy Garcia is not as convincing though, and just doesn't sit right as the leading man, a husband who, however concerned, can't seem to prevent his marriage from self destructing. Luis Mandoki does manage some strong emotional scenes as director especially when the family's two young daughters are involved, yet he is unable to create a consistent and moving drama with Ronald Bass and Al Franken's script. "When a Man Loves a Woman" has a weak beginning, and unfortunately tends to lapse back into the uninspired groove too often. A harsher, more realistic ending may also have helped. Certainly not a complete waste of time, but never constantly hard hitting or disturbing enough to have the desired effect. Also known in the U.S. as "Significant Other". PS I personally struggled with much of the enunciation throughout the movie and consequently missed several lines. Saturday August 13, 1994 - Greater Union Melbourne

    I have to disagree with the critics once again. This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan). Andy Garcia on the other hand was totally miss-cast for the role in my opinion (come on critics, before giving up all those stars, can't you imagine the acting in such a movie by let's say... Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics). This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser... How politically correct can you get? No, definitely not for me...

    OK it is hard for me to see such a masterpiece with an average rating because these kind of performances don't come along everyday. Personally I think this picture should have been nominated for best film of the year. All the performances in the film were top notch even the kids. When I watch this movie, I almost feel like I am in the theater watching a play. The interaction is so intense and skillful. Andy Garcia also should have gotten just as much praise as Meg Ryan both performances were outstanding. Sometimes I think he gets overlooked because he's so hot but yes this man's acting was amazing especially in the main argument scene. In any case, so sickening when a film like this isn't recognized to the full extent of it's greatness. Such a powerful and beautiful contribution to the art of film.

    Just saw this movie for the first time and it had me cry so much. I know drama makes better impact on people's thoughts about a movie, but I truly never likes drama as it makes me feel sad about life. The degree that Garcia loves Ryan just terrifies the theory of letting love go. He never gives up in the end but we are not supposed to pursue love like that. Hollywood movies most go with happy endings although it's predictable but it does not break my heart over and over again and does not tear my belief about goods always deserves the best. no more drama...

    In my 40 years of active involvement with recovery programs for family members either addicted to alcohol, or adversely affected by someone else's drinking, this movie 'tells it like it is' better than the majority of other movies I've seen that dealt with similar issues - "I'll Cry Tomorrow'(Susan Hayward),'Days of Wine and Roses'(Lee Remick/Jack Lemmon), 'Bill's Story' (James Gardner) and the Hallmark production of "Love is Never Enough" (Lois Wilson story) left a lot out of the real impact of physical, emotional, psychological and social abuse or damage suffered by alcoholic relationships. This movie depicted a superb example of the pain, confusion, guilt, denial and resistance to change by both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic . . . and the damaging impact to the children and other close associates. The acting by the cast, and especially the children, was phenomenal. The mention and portrayal of an Al-Anon Family Group meeting for the family being affected by either the actively drinking or the new sobriety of an alcoholic was well revealed for the viewer. The final scene was the only part that was 'out of character' for an AA or Al-Anon person at a meeting. All else was 'on target'. 'Thanks for letting me share.' V

    Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a "closet" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the "party mood" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a "Betty Ford" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a "good cry", for it has wonderful cathartic elements.

    I really hated this film. I quite liked the beginning when Meg Ryan descended from bubbly to downright alcoholic but then the rest of the film was just completely lost on me. First and foremost, I find it a failure in the script that the story focused entirely on the relationship between the two grown ups and neglected the children. Personally, I think this would have been the more interesting story. But secondly, I just didn't get what Garcia's character was supposed to have done wrong. I honestly didn't although I was prepared to. So he may have been a macho but I saw him as being portrayed as supportive and a victim of her alcoholism just as the rest of the family. Why he should be partly responsible for it is beyond me as it was never properly explained.

    WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a searing and emotional look at how alcoholism manages to leave a family in shreds and how they struggle to put themselves back together again. Meg Ryan, in the performance of her career, dominates the screen with her powerhouse portrayal of Alice, a wife, mother, and career woman whose secret drinking is slowly and methodically destroying her life. The film chronicles Alice's journey as she hits her bottom, enters rehab, finishes rehab, and then tries to resume the life she left before rehab and discovers it's not as simple as she thinks. Andy Garcia is equally solid as Michael, Alice's sensitive and loving husband who finds out what real powerlessness is as he watches Alice fall apart and is introduced to a new kind of powerlessness when Alice returns home with a new attitude and new friends she made during her recovery process. Lots of great films have been made over the years about alcoholism but what makes this one stand out is that it not only deals with the alcoholism and the rehabilitation process, but it more importantly shows what happens when the alcoholic tries to resume their old life, slowing coming to the realization that it is no longer their old life anymore because they now have to face it sober. It also approaches the subject from the angle of the alcoholic's loved ones as we see Garcia's Michael struggle with the new person Alice has become and finds his only outlet for his frustration in Al-Anon meetings, where he finally realizes he is not alone. Luis Madoki's sensitive direction is also an asset but this film works mainly thanks to a well-rounded screenplay and the sterling performances by Andy Garcia and especially Meg Ryan, in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Don't miss this one.

    Less than powerful film about the traumas a young family experiences when one of the adults becomes an alcoholic and goes through the very demanding de-toxication program. Meg Ryan expands her repertoire with a solid performance as alcoholic Alice Green, a young woman who knows that her addiction is tearing her family apart, as she feels helpless to do anything at all. Andy Garcia is not as convincing though, and just doesn't sit right as the leading man, a husband who, however concerned, can't seem to prevent his marriage from self destructing. Luis Mandoki does manage some strong emotional scenes as director especially when the family's two young daughters are involved, yet he is unable to create a consistent and moving drama with Ronald Bass and Al Franken's script. "When a Man Loves a Woman" has a weak beginning, and unfortunately tends to lapse back into the uninspired groove too often. A harsher, more realistic ending may also have helped. Certainly not a complete waste of time, but never constantly hard hitting or disturbing enough to have the desired effect. Also known in the U.S. as "Significant Other". PS I personally struggled with much of the enunciation throughout the movie and consequently missed several lines. Saturday August 13, 1994 - Greater Union Melbourne

    I have to disagree with the critics once again. This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan). Andy Garcia on the other hand was totally miss-cast for the role in my opinion (come on critics, before giving up all those stars, can't you imagine the acting in such a movie by let's say... Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics). This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser... How politically correct can you get? No, definitely not for me...

    I've always appreciated this film for its honest look at how insidious alcoholism is and how it devastates those around the addict. I watched it again on a lazy Saturday afternoon and, despite its flaws, its an excellent film and a great look at how alcoholism is a family disease. Meg Ryan's Alice is an alcoholic in a comfortable though unhealthy marriage with Andy Garcia's Michael, an enabler and rescuer. Alice hits rock bottom and heads off to detox. The family struggles while she is away, but still struggles when Alice gets back and fights to stay clean and sober. This is one of the greatest strengths of the film. Becoming sober is not the hard part. Staying sober is. Learning to live life sober is incredibly challenging. Meg Ryan gives a masterful performance in this. However, on re-viewing, I really appreciated the nuances of Andy Garcia's performance. Michael clearly finds meaning in helping and fixing all the problems around him. However, when Alice is sober and he finds he doesn't need to rescue her anymore, he is lost, angry, disappointed, and hurt. His speech at the Al Anon meeting when he admits that he feels pain seeing his wife doing so well without his help is powerful. The child actresses are great, particularly Tina Majorino. I wish they would have delved a bit more into how mom's alcoholism affected the kids. Also, Michael's speech at the very end is cringeworthy, sugarcoating what is otherwise an honest and very real portrayal of addiction and recovery.

I know drama makes better impact on people's thoughts about a movie, but I truly never likes drama as it makes me feel sad about life. The degree that Garcia loves Ryan just terrifies the theory of letting love go. He never gives up in the end but we are not supposed to pursue love like that. Hollywood movies most go with happy endings although it's predictable but it does not break my heart over and over again and does not tear my belief about goods always deserves the best. no more drama...

    In my 40 years of active involvement with recovery programs for family members either addicted to alcohol, or adversely affected by someone else's drinking, this movie 'tells it like it is' better than the majority of other movies I've seen that dealt with similar issues - "I'll Cry Tomorrow'(Susan Hayward),'Days of Wine and Roses'(Lee Remick/Jack Lemmon), 'Bill's Story' (James Gardner) and the Hallmark production of "Love is Never Enough" (Lois Wilson story) left a lot out of the real impact of physical, emotional, psychological and social abuse or damage suffered by alcoholic relationships. This movie depicted a superb example of the pain, confusion, guilt, denial and resistance to change by both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic . . . and the damaging impact to the children and other close associates. The acting by the cast, and especially the children, was phenomenal. The mention and portrayal of an Al-Anon Family Group meeting for the family being affected by either the actively drinking or the new sobriety of an alcoholic was well revealed for the viewer. The final scene was the only part that was 'out of character' for an AA or Al-Anon person at a meeting. All else was 'on target'. 'Thanks for letting me share.' V

    Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife, Alice (Meg Ryan) are living the good life in San Francisco. They are both professionals, they live in a lovely home, and they have two beautiful daughters (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman). But, they also have a secret. Alice is a "closet" alcoholic, who is on the verge of showing it to the world and Michael is doing his best to cover for her to everyone. Things are complicated, for Alice seems happier when she is in the "party mood" and Michael loves her so much that he actually appears to relish his role as the one Alice calls on to put herself back together. Yet, even a vacation to Mexico does not help Alice find the self-happiness she needs to lose the bottle. Also, Alice injures herself at home, scaring the girls beyond measure and they are suffering from neglect, too. Therefore, Alice has to enter a "Betty Ford" type clinic. But, will Michael and Alice both like and love each other when Alice is sober? This is a great movie for its honest portrayal of the effects an alcoholic has on the family he or she loves and on the long climb out of the world of alcoholism. Alice and Michael are not really living the American dream but the American nightmare, because of Alice's need for one drink after another. Both Ryan and Garcia are truly wonderful in roles that call upon them to be both lovable and repugnant, at the same time. The other cast members, including Ellen Burstyn and the two lovely little girl-actresses, are also just perfect. Naturally, the settings in San Fran and Mexico are great, especially the Green's beautiful old house. Costumes, too, are very well-chosen and all other other productions values of direction, photography and story are most worthy, too. Then, too, the film also has great value as a movie to show the realities of alcoholism to any audience that could benefit from such a view. In summary, if you are a man or woman who loves movies that tell a tale well, with gorgeous stars, even if it might result in a few shed tears, this is a great choice. You might even pop it in when you need a "good cry", for it has wonderful cathartic elements.

    I really hated this film. I quite liked the beginning when Meg Ryan descended from bubbly to downright alcoholic but then the rest of the film was just completely lost on me. First and foremost, I find it a failure in the script that the story focused entirely on the relationship between the two grown ups and neglected the children. Personally, I think this would have been the more interesting story. But secondly, I just didn't get what Garcia's character was supposed to have done wrong. I honestly didn't although I was prepared to. So he may have been a macho but I saw him as being portrayed as supportive and a victim of her alcoholism just as the rest of the family. Why he should be partly responsible for it is beyond me as it was never properly explained.

    WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a searing and emotional look at how alcoholism manages to leave a family in shreds and how they struggle to put themselves back together again. Meg Ryan, in the performance of her career, dominates the screen with her powerhouse portrayal of Alice, a wife, mother, and career woman whose secret drinking is slowly and methodically destroying her life. The film chronicles Alice's journey as she hits her bottom, enters rehab, finishes rehab, and then tries to resume the life she left before rehab and discovers it's not as simple as she thinks. Andy Garcia is equally solid as Michael, Alice's sensitive and loving husband who finds out what real powerlessness is as he watches Alice fall apart and is introduced to a new kind of powerlessness when Alice returns home with a new attitude and new friends she made during her recovery process. Lots of great films have been made over the years about alcoholism but what makes this one stand out is that it not only deals with the alcoholism and the rehabilitation process, but it more importantly shows what happens when the alcoholic tries to resume their old life, slowing coming to the realization that it is no longer their old life anymore because they now have to face it sober. It also approaches the subject from the angle of the alcoholic's loved ones as we see Garcia's Michael struggle with the new person Alice has become and finds his only outlet for his frustration in Al-Anon meetings, where he finally realizes he is not alone. Luis Madoki's sensitive direction is also an asset but this film works mainly thanks to a well-rounded screenplay and the sterling performances by Andy Garcia and especially Meg Ryan, in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Don't miss this one.

    Less than powerful film about the traumas a young family experiences when one of the adults becomes an alcoholic and goes through the very demanding de-toxication program. Meg Ryan expands her repertoire with a solid performance as alcoholic Alice Green, a young woman who knows that her addiction is tearing her family apart, as she feels helpless to do anything at all. Andy Garcia is not as convincing though, and just doesn't sit right as the leading man, a husband who, however concerned, can't seem to prevent his marriage from self destructing. Luis Mandoki does manage some strong emotional scenes as director especially when the family's two young daughters are involved, yet he is unable to create a consistent and moving drama with Ronald Bass and Al Franken's script. "When a Man Loves a Woman" has a weak beginning, and unfortunately tends to lapse back into the uninspired groove too often. A harsher, more realistic ending may also have helped. Certainly not a complete waste of time, but never constantly hard hitting or disturbing enough to have the desired effect. Also known in the U.S. as "Significant Other". PS I personally struggled with much of the enunciation throughout the movie and consequently missed several lines. Saturday August 13, 1994 - Greater Union Melbourne

    I have to disagree with the critics once again. This was nothing more than a below average movie. It might have deserved a rating a little higher than 2 stars, but the ending definitely ruined whatever good was seen in the movie beforehand. I found the script was too simplistic, and the acting nothing more than average (even though I am a huge Meg Ryan fan). Andy Garcia on the other hand was totally miss-cast for the role in my opinion (come on critics, before giving up all those stars, can't you imagine the acting in such a movie by let's say... Merryl Streep and William Hurt? Just think about it... The general public on IMDb had much more sense and gave it a lower average score than the critics). This is a film with no real emotions in my opinion. We never really get the feel of the relationship between Ryan and Garcia in the beginning. We never really get to sympathize or feel for the characters as the movie moves along. None of it ever seems real... and everything seems too obvious. In order to compensate for this, the movie resolves itself in the typically Hollywoodian feel-good manner. The film is based on the currently very much in vogue culture of permissiveness; everybody can do anything and it's OK: the wife can trash a car parked on the curb and that's OK, the kids can half demolish the house, that's OK, etc. How very typical of the '68 generation. Furthermore, building on this concept, the film shows how it is OK to be weak, positive to be a loser, but if you are strong, have values and principles, live according to a set of rules, you are out, almost as if you where sick, you have to be 'healed' so that you too can become a loser... How politically correct can you get? No, definitely not for me...

    I've always appreciated this film for its honest look at how insidious alcoholism is and how it devastates those around the addict. I watched it again on a lazy Saturday afternoon and, despite its flaws, its an excellent film and a great look at how alcoholism is a family disease. Meg Ryan's Alice is an alcoholic in a comfortable though unhealthy marriage with Andy Garcia's Michael, an enabler and rescuer. Alice hits rock bottom and heads off to detox. The family struggles while she is away, but still struggles when Alice gets back and fights to stay clean and sober. This is one of the greatest strengths of the film. Becoming sober is not the hard part. Staying sober is. Learning to live life sober is incredibly challenging. Meg Ryan gives a masterful performance in this. However, on re-viewing, I really appreciated the nuances of Andy Garcia's performance. Michael clearly finds meaning in helping and fixing all the problems around him. However, when Alice is sober and he finds he doesn't need to rescue her anymore, he is lost, angry, disappointed, and hurt. His speech at the Al Anon meeting when he admits that he feels pain seeing his wife doing so well without his help is powerful. The child actresses are great, particularly Tina Majorino. I wish they would have delved a bit more into how mom's alcoholism affected the kids. Also, Michael's speech at the very end is cringeworthy, sugarcoating what is otherwise an honest and very real portrayal of addiction and recovery.

    OK it is hard for me to see such a masterpiece with an average rating because these kind of performances don't come along everyday. Personally I think this picture should have been nominated for best film of the year. All the performances in the film were top notch even the kids. When I watch this movie, I almost feel like I am in the theater watching a play. The interaction is so intense and skillful. Andy Garcia also should have gotten just as much praise as Meg Ryan both performances were outstanding. Sometimes I think he gets overlooked because he's so hot but yes this man's acting was amazing especially in the main argument scene. In any case, so sickening when a film like this isn't recognized to the full extent of it's greatness. Such a powerful and beautiful contribution to the art of film.
