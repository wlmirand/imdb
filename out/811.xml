  Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould
 </titulo>
 <rating>
  7.2
 </rating>
 <sinopse>
  A collection of vignettes highlighting different aspects of the life, work, and character of the acclaimed Canadian classical pianist.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As the title suggests, this dramatised documentary about the eccentric Canadian pianist Glenn Gould is broken up into thirty-two short films (mirroring the thirty-two part structure of Bach's 'Goldberg Variations', the recording that Gould made famous), each giving us an insight into some aspect of Gould's life and career. Out of respect for the music lead actor Colm Feore is never seen playing the piano, merely reacting to Gould's own recordings, which are extensively featured

    Glenn Gould was a classical pianist of the first order. Made famous for his recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variation's, first in 1955 and then in 1981. As the short films show, Gould was an oddball with tremendous talent. He hummed along while playing, and was totally unaware of this quirk. The recording engineers were driven insane by this habit which can be heard on the final product. He was also a hypochondriac, constantly taking his own blood pressure and several medications simultaneously, which he chronicled in a diary. Some of the one to six minute segments are recreations, and others are interviews with people who knew him. The soundtrack is magnificent, for Gould's technique is breathtaking. Thirty Two Short Films is the story of a true genius whose life ended much too soon at the age of fifty, an almost self fulfilling prophecy, given the man's obsessive behavior. I loved this sad and beautiful movie.

    Let me preface this review by saying: the music of Bach permeates my existence. Over the years, I've listened to nearly every recording there is, repeatedly. That said, I had trouble watching this movie. The first time I tried, I quit after five minutes. Last evening, I made it all the way through. While at times moving, the film disturbs. For one, it does not do visual justice to the music. Bach's compositions are not about waving hands in the air, geometry animations, or men walking off into infinity. They're complex literary statements. This variety of music is akin to the best silent cinema; it says volumes, but without words. Like pantomime, it tells a nuanced story, weaving multiple plot lines together into an evocative fabric. Few of the 32 vignettes approached that ideal. Could it be that some of Bach's greatest admirers fail to grasp the deeper meaning within the music? In addition, Gould's personal faults grate on the nerves. It's clear he wasn't an ideal specimen. He mistook music for life. Music is a condiment, a catalyst perhaps. It frames life, drawing attention to worthy matters. It spices and enlivens life, making it savory. But it is not life. His mind was filled with picture frames, but no pictures. He fell in love with music in the same way that parrots sometimes mistakenly bond with their human owners. They are not parrots, and music is not a woman. One wonders how Bach might greet Gould in heaven: "So, the bachelor thinks he understands the man with two wives and twenty children? Let's see what kind of music you'll play after we give you a well-rounded life."

    This is a great film, and it goes into territories that few films even recognize, let alone approach. It does start a little slow, and the first few 'shorts' can come off as a bit ... well, pretentious, to be blunt. But past that, it's a fantastic portrait of an interesting character, and one which satisfies on a number of levels --- creatively, intellectually, and even emotionally. What sets this film aside from many others are two main elements; the first is the novelty by which the film is presented: 32 short films, some of which are quite the same, but many of which are unexpected blasts of what can only be called 'experimental film'--- some of which seems almost silly, given how far technology and special effects have come since 1993. The 'films' really are quite short, and many of them are almost like small 'puzzles' which unfold so quickly that it's not until a second viewing that their underlying message becomes a bit more obvious, and it becomes clear how well-tied together all the shorts are. This is not short-attention span theatre, but it moves quick enough that once you get into the film, it's difficult to stop watching. The other element which makes this film so great is the basic premise, and the way in which it refuses to be dumbed down for the audience. This is the rare case of a movie that respects it's audience, even at the expense of losing half an audience by not being bombastic and overly obvious. The first few shorts are the weakest, but they establish the basic character and 'backstory' of Gould quite well" He's a piano virtuoso who has become so amazing at playing piano that calling him 'genius' is a bit of an understatement. And while his character has a definite surplus of eccentricities and quirks, this film doesn't focus on his genius as we're used to seeing films treat the subject. Whereas most films make out a person;s genius to be a heavy burden to carry, which always seems to come at a high cost and lead to a desire for normalacy (to make we in the audience feel better for not being geniuses, I suppose), 32 Short Films goes in another direction: Here's a genius who enjoys being who he is, who makes the most of his mostly self-imposed loneliness by turning it into art, who enjoys the intellectual challenge of his own conflicts with intellectual society. Rather than the familiar portrait of genius as a soul-crippling condition which becomes almost indistinguishable from minor autism, we see a full human being, realized and thoughtful, able to confuse the sometimes-adoring, sometimes-confrontational media by admitting that he doesn't think it's worth talking about music--- how about talking about Indian rights, or the supernatural, or something that has no ostensible connection to music or anything piano-related? If you play music, or if you are an aficionado of classical music, there's a whole depth to this film which you'll enjoy, although it's not as at the forefront of the film as you might suspect. This is not a film about music, but the sort of person who plays music, recognizable as a character APART from the skill which defines him so much for everyone else. This movie is a bit dated. That's really one thing it has working against it in some sense--- it feels at times like a movie from the 80's, and not in a 'cool 80's' way. Nonetheless, there's a certain air to the film which seems to disregard any particular age entirely, and this makes sense in a way, because Gould was clearly not one to feel confined to the age, and the ways in which things were being done. There are so many things that are tempting to say about this film, which are probably just my own interpretations and conclusions, which it's probably better not to go into, simply because half the enjoyment of this film is developing those realizations yourself. Even if you can't stand classical music, you'll find this film rewarding. Highly recommended.

    "32 Short Films About Glenn Gould" gets my vote for the year's Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Director, and as my friend David said, "Best thing since sliced bread." Glenn Gould was a Canadian concert pianist. When he was thirty-two he announced he would no longer perform live concerts. Instead he would record and broadcast only, as he saw the performance hall as an elitist and obsolete means of presenting music. He was the first noted classical performer to abandon formal performance attire, something radical at the time, opting for a business suit rather the traditional black tie and tails. But his ideas extended beyond performance sites and attire to the very nature of art, challenging the hierarchical distinction between "artist" and "audience." He wanted creative listening as well as creative performing. And like many geniuses he was full of peculiarities and paradoxes. He would usually grant interviews only over the phone, and as Yehudi Menuhin said, created his own life and led it to the exclusion of the rest of the world, doing nothing but applying himself to his physical and intellectual work. He was a perfectionist in his recording and his music, yet would hum as he played and record with little regard for things like a squeaky chair or pianos with noisy works. He was a man who cherished solitude, but would talk for hours on the phone and is remembered as a kind and compassionate man. He disdained violence and competition. As a child he serenaded cows in a pasture; upon his death he left half his estate to the SPCA, the other half to the Salvation Army. One of the many things this movie does well is to integrate actors portraying people, incidents and possibilities with real people speaking their own thoughts. A piano tuner, a chambermaid, an agent, cousin Jessie Norman and others talk about Glenn Gould. In one segment we see the depiction of the final moments before his last concert. Immediately following, Yehudi Menuhin speaks insightfully about Gould's reasoning behind discontinuing public concerts and elaborates on Gould's mindset. Menuhin's appearance makes the previous dramatization seem as real as cinema verit&eacute;. A Sociologist recalled being interviewed on the Canadian radio system by Glenn Gould. "It was a very penetrating interview, the most intelligent questions I think I've heard about the North, from experts, laymen, or anything else ... questions that required rather long answers and as I would start to speak or make a point, he would register his feelings not by voice, but by a smile ... All the time he was using his hands and conducting. And this was perhaps slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts, because I had no idea what this was all about. He was continuously waving his hands, sort of as if to bring up this idea or so on ... I was his orchestra for that hour." And throughout the "32 Films", we see that conducting the sound in his world is no affectation, but an indication of how deeply attentive Gould's perceptions and musical sensibilities run. In "Truck Stop" we witness Glenn Gould listening in on ambient conversations at the diner, subtly and almost surreptitiously moving a forefinger in concert with a conversation as it swells, subsides and blends with the other conversations and sounds throughout the highway restaurant. Such is just one example of the film's subtle yet magnificently effective structure, linking several of the "short films," in this case by displaying Glenn Gould's compulsion to conduct sound, whether while listening to an interviewee, a Beethoven sonata, or to the conversations at a truck stop. Glenn Gould seemed to focus on sound as intently as a Zen monk would attend to his breath during meditating. As a child he listened voraciously to the radio. As an adult he played the radio even while he slept; in fact he could not sleep without the radio turned on. He was always listening. We know that sound conveyed extra meaning to Glenn Gould. After watching this movie it seems to me that he heard so much, he was compelled to organize it into music at least in part because he could not ignore it. He seemed to hear no sound in isolation. I have to believe he could hear no silence. One of Gould's driving passions was solitude. He considered it to be a necessary element in the human equation and an important condition for nurturing the creative process. He linked the idea of solitude with the far North and explored it in an innovative radio format, a sound documentary, called, "The Idea of North." In the movie, the short film "The Idea of North" immediately follows "Truck Stop," showing us some of the inspirational link to the radio production. As in "Truck Stop," we first hear a single voice talking, which is then joined by other voices that mingle and intertwine as musically as a string quintet of voices. This movie may not change your life, but it made me more elated and optimistic about the world than any movie I can remember. It woke up some of my curiosities and gave me a renewed shot of vitality. It made me think about how a person can use his capabilities and ingenuity to a creative purpose and how much better we all are for it. It reminded me that solitude need not be dark and lonely but can be fodder for the joy of creative imagination; that we need not have the artistic genius of a Glenn Gould to justify our efforts, nor a Bach cantata every Sunday morning to hear music. We have our own eyes and ears to use and our own curiosity to explore. Many drops make an ocean, and as Shakespeare said, "Sweet are the uses of adversity."

    It is notoriously difficult to make a compelling film about the life of an artist. Directors usually resort to depicting those troubled geniuses, such as Van Gogh and Michelangelo, who had vivid and turbulent lives, even then the resulting film is often lamentable. Glenn Gould may have been a genius, and may have had more than his fair share of eccentricities but it requires something special to make a powerful and strange film about an over-intellectual pianist. Francois Girard's 'Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould' is certainly special, and often dazzling. Of course it will not appeal to those who like blockbuster type films, or to those who can't read without moving their lips, it requires an intelligent, informed and attentive audience (which pretty much rules out the vast majority of the cinema-going public) but not one that is especially interested in classical music. Anyone who is interested in the creative spirit in man or in experimental film-making will I think find this a wonderful film. Just fifteen years after its release the film now seems to have been completely forgotten. The fact that, at the time of writing, it is not yet available in Europe on a DVD seems a terrible indictment of the current state of the money-obsessed, Hollywood-driven film marketing industry. If you have a brain - and a soul  go search this little gem out.

    Each of these 32 separate miniatures occurs in a structure meant to emulate the structure of the Goldberg variations, the musical piece Gould is most closely associated with. Colm Feore does a wonderful job conveying the Canadian genius in all his eccentricities, whether musical, social or personal. His portrayal of Gould is as well across a range of ages. For a man who did "not like the piano" we can only be astonished at the impact he had on the music and media world, a world he left early in his professional life and a wider world he departed from early by his death at the age of fifty.

    This week we watch a non-linear film tilted Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. This film took thirty-two vignettes that concern some aspect of Glenn Gould's life. Vignette is that in theatre and script writing, these are short, impressionistic, scenes that focus on one moment or gives one impression about a character, an idea or a setting. Each of these thirty-two shorts are glimpses into the life of Gould, they are like puzzle pieces that we, because of the non-linear aspects, are forced to piece together the life of Gould. It was 32 shorts that were all different from each other, which helped to bring out the theme. It is possibly named after a musical piece that Gould did an interpretation on, Bach's Goldberg Variations. Because these vignettes are broken up into various sections it was more interested than if it were linear. The shorts demand out attention in order to make connections between the disassociation of these clips. In order for us to understand the irrational we must use the irrational thought to explain it. I think that this was done beautifully in Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. We are drawn in to the film by the various clips and the beautiful music that we hear. The beat of the video draws us to want to learn about this man who in this documentary tells his own story. This man seems to interview himself. He holds his interviews by telephone. While he is on a phone conversation he talks through out the night to himself while the person on the other side of the line has fallen asleep. On a play of what was going on, he would introduce his own thoughts by asking himself a question, and then he acted out the answer. This helped us to understand who he was and helped us look at him subjectively. This man was a genius, in his musical abilities many were awed. It could be said that isolation can breed genius but genius can breed isolation. Is it possible that this is what happened to Gould? Who knows what could have been going on in his mind? An outward appearance that we get of him is his clothes. He would wear layers of clothes even in the summer time to prevent from catching a cold. There is a short where we see all the various pills Gould was taking trying to balance each other out shown in various shapes, sizes, and color. The music that we hear is what connected Gould to the rest of the world but at the same time it kept him separated from it. Technology was able to help Gould perfect his music. There is a clip where Gould is in a recording studio and we are listening to a play back of a recording he just made. He says that after listening to it that it is almost good. The recording seems to takes the soul out of music. He decides that he wants to re-record the track, so he prepares to play, but we don't see him play. The show is about a piano player but we never saw him playing the piano. It is possible that he hated the instrument that he is most known for. You would think that since this is a documentary about a piano player that you would get to see him play, but you don't. Is this out of respect for him, he is so into his music that it was about him and not his music. It could also be that the film is not about him but about who he was. A genius mind is very complex and often difficult or hard to understand. I think the film does well to try and portray the randomness of a genius mind in the style of non-linear film where we are forced to use our own minds to make the connections in the life of Glenn Gould.

    I for one loved the film. At first, I thought that the non-linear bit would wind up just being a gimmick, but I am happy to say my assumption was quite incorrect. If one is willing to put some effort into the film, rather than simply viewing it and really think about each film and its connection to the next short, there is some great content. My personal favorite was "Hamburg." It's all about the closing line in that one. If you haven't seen it, stop and think about this one in particular if you do. When you understand it, you'll get a great feel of how the film works. At times, though, it did get a bit tedious. Some shorts were not as interesting to watch--interesting to think about, though. All in all, I recommend it to anyone who has a little bit of time to think about it afterward, because that's where the satisfaction comes from.

    I'll admit, I'm a sucker for films about artists-- especially troubled eccentrics. Canadian Glenn Gould, one of the most celebrated and controversial pianists in history, is honored in this brilliant cinematic portrait. Rather than travel the middle-of-the-road, as did last year's biopic "Ray", director Francois Girard and screenwriter Don McKellar offer thirty-two vibrant, momentary glimpses of Gould's life, which combine, like the facets of a prism-- or the notes of a melody. Each short film is a piece of a puzzle that spans childhood to old age. While the styles vary from narrative to abstract, one constant is the hypnotic beat of Gould's genius fingers across the keyboard. Though I don't know a lot about classical music, this film made me hungry to learn more. There's a lovely scene where a hotel chambermaid falls spell to one of Gould's dazzling recordings. At that moment, so did I. Actor Colm Feore respectfully portrays the perfectionism, idealism, and anguish that eventually unraveled Gould's career. Oh, but what a career it was!

    the concept works. i like how the film is composed of individual films, yet the individual films do an excellent job of telling a singular, cohesive story. the best aspect is that we don't have to deal with the boring plot proceedings- we just fill in the blanks ourselves. learning about gould's personality through the dialogue kept my interest, but looking back, it was actually the strictly instrumental pieces that really kept my interest. fortunately gould's actual performances are mesmerizing enough on their own to really supplement the visuals. a couple of favorites off the top of my head are "man sitting in chair" and "a day's journal" (sorry, not the exact titles i think). colm feore, i've seen you in about a dozen pictures, but this is the one that made me really notice your name.

    Glenn Gould was a classical pianist of the first order. Made famous for his recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variation's, first in 1955 and then in 1981. As the short films show, Gould was an oddball with tremendous talent. He hummed along while playing, and was totally unaware of this quirk. The recording engineers were driven insane by this habit which can be heard on the final product. He was also a hypochondriac, constantly taking his own blood pressure and several medications simultaneously, which he chronicled in a diary. Some of the one to six minute segments are recreations, and others are interviews with people who knew him. The soundtrack is magnificent, for Gould's technique is breathtaking. Thirty Two Short Films is the story of a true genius whose life ended much too soon at the age of fifty, an almost self fulfilling prophecy, given the man's obsessive behavior.

Instead he would record and broadcast only, as he saw the performance hall as an elitist and obsolete means of presenting music. He was the first noted classical performer to abandon formal performance attire, something radical at the time, opting for a business suit rather the traditional black tie and tails. But his ideas extended beyond performance sites and attire to the very nature of art, challenging the hierarchical distinction between "artist" and "audience." He wanted creative listening as well as creative performing. And like many geniuses he was full of peculiarities and paradoxes. He would usually grant interviews only over the phone, and as Yehudi Menuhin said, created his own life and led it to the exclusion of the rest of the world, doing nothing but applying himself to his physical and intellectual work. He was a perfectionist in his recording and his music, yet would hum as he played and record with little regard for things like a squeaky chair or pianos with noisy works. He was a man who cherished solitude, but would talk for hours on the phone and is remembered as a kind and compassionate man. He disdained violence and competition. As a child he serenaded cows in a pasture; upon his death he left half his estate to the SPCA, the other half to the Salvation Army. One of the many things this movie does well is to integrate actors portraying people, incidents and possibilities with real people speaking their own thoughts. A piano tuner, a chambermaid, an agent, cousin Jessie Norman and others talk about Glenn Gould. In one segment we see the depiction of the final moments before his last concert. Immediately following, Yehudi Menuhin speaks insightfully about Gould's reasoning behind discontinuing public concerts and elaborates on Gould's mindset. Menuhin's appearance makes the previous dramatization seem as real as cinema verit&eacute;. A Sociologist recalled being interviewed on the Canadian radio system by Glenn Gould. "It was a very penetrating interview, the most intelligent questions I think I've heard about the North, from experts, laymen, or anything else ... questions that required rather long answers and as I would start to speak or make a point, he would register his feelings not by voice, but by a smile ... All the time he was using his hands and conducting. And this was perhaps slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts, because I had no idea what this was all about. He was continuously waving his hands, sort of as if to bring up this idea or so on ... I was his orchestra for that hour." And throughout the "32 Films", we see that conducting the sound in his world is no affectation, but an indication of how deeply attentive Gould's perceptions and musical sensibilities run. In "Truck Stop" we witness Glenn Gould listening in on ambient conversations at the diner, subtly and almost surreptitiously moving a forefinger in concert with a conversation as it swells, subsides and blends with the other conversations and sounds throughout the highway restaurant. Such is just one example of the film's subtle yet magnificently effective structure, linking several of the "short films," in this case by displaying Glenn Gould's compulsion to conduct sound, whether while listening to an interviewee, a Beethoven sonata, or to the conversations at a truck stop. Glenn Gould seemed to focus on sound as intently as a Zen monk would attend to his breath during meditating. As a child he listened voraciously to the radio. As an adult he played the radio even while he slept; in fact he could not sleep without the radio turned on. He was always listening. We know that sound conveyed extra meaning to Glenn Gould. After watching this movie it seems to me that he heard so much, he was compelled to organize it into music at least in part because he could not ignore it. He seemed to hear no sound in isolation. I have to believe he could hear no silence. One of Gould's driving passions was solitude. He considered it to be a necessary element in the human equation and an important condition for nurturing the creative process. He linked the idea of solitude with the far North and explored it in an innovative radio format, a sound documentary, called, "The Idea of North." In the movie, the short film "The Idea of North" immediately follows "Truck Stop," showing us some of the inspirational link to the radio production. As in "Truck Stop," we first hear a single voice talking, which is then joined by other voices that mingle and intertwine as musically as a string quintet of voices. This movie may not change your life, but it made me more elated and optimistic about the world than any movie I can remember. It woke up some of my curiosities and gave me a renewed shot of vitality. It made me think about how a person can use his capabilities and ingenuity to a creative purpose and how much better we all are for it. It reminded me that solitude need not be dark and lonely but can be fodder for the joy of creative imagination; that we need not have the artistic genius of a Glenn Gould to justify our efforts, nor a Bach cantata every Sunday morning to hear music. We have our own eyes and ears to use and our own curiosity to explore. Many drops make an ocean, and as Shakespeare said, "Sweet are the uses of adversity."

    It is notoriously difficult to make a compelling film about the life of an artist. Directors usually resort to depicting those troubled geniuses, such as Van Gogh and Michelangelo, who had vivid and turbulent lives, even then the resulting film is often lamentable. Glenn Gould may have been a genius, and may have had more than his fair share of eccentricities but it requires something special to make a powerful and strange film about an over-intellectual pianist. Francois Girard's 'Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould' is certainly special, and often dazzling. Of course it will not appeal to those who like blockbuster type films, or to those who can't read without moving their lips, it requires an intelligent, informed and attentive audience (which pretty much rules out the vast majority of the cinema-going public) but not one that is especially interested in classical music. Anyone who is interested in the creative spirit in man or in experimental film-making will I think find this a wonderful film. Just fifteen years after its release the film now seems to have been completely forgotten. The fact that, at the time of writing, it is not yet available in Europe on a DVD seems a terrible indictment of the current state of the money-obsessed, Hollywood-driven film marketing industry. If you have a brain - and a soul  go search this little gem out.

    Each of these 32 separate miniatures occurs in a structure meant to emulate the structure of the Goldberg variations, the musical piece Gould is most closely associated with. Colm Feore does a wonderful job conveying the Canadian genius in all his eccentricities, whether musical, social or personal. His portrayal of Gould is as well across a range of ages. For a man who did "not like the piano" we can only be astonished at the impact he had on the music and media world, a world he left early in his professional life and a wider world he departed from early by his death at the age of fifty.

    This week we watch a non-linear film tilted Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. This film took thirty-two vignettes that concern some aspect of Glenn Gould's life. Vignette is that in theatre and script writing, these are short, impressionistic, scenes that focus on one moment or gives one impression about a character, an idea or a setting. Each of these thirty-two shorts are glimpses into the life of Gould, they are like puzzle pieces that we, because of the non-linear aspects, are forced to piece together the life of Gould. It was 32 shorts that were all different from each other, which helped to bring out the theme. It is possibly named after a musical piece that Gould did an interpretation on, Bach's Goldberg Variations. Because these vignettes are broken up into various sections it was more interested than if it were linear. The shorts demand out attention in order to make connections between the disassociation of these clips. In order for us to understand the irrational we must use the irrational thought to explain it. I think that this was done beautifully in Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. We are drawn in to the film by the various clips and the beautiful music that we hear. The beat of the video draws us to want to learn about this man who in this documentary tells his own story. This man seems to interview himself. He holds his interviews by telephone. While he is on a phone conversation he talks through out the night to himself while the person on the other side of the line has fallen asleep. On a play of what was going on, he would introduce his own thoughts by asking himself a question, and then he acted out the answer. This helped us to understand who he was and helped us look at him subjectively. This man was a genius, in his musical abilities many were awed. It could be said that isolation can breed genius but genius can breed isolation. Is it possible that this is what happened to Gould? Who knows what could have been going on in his mind? An outward appearance that we get of him is his clothes. He would wear layers of clothes even in the summer time to prevent from catching a cold. There is a short where we see all the various pills Gould was taking trying to balance each other out shown in various shapes, sizes, and color. The music that we hear is what connected Gould to the rest of the world but at the same time it kept him separated from it. Technology was able to help Gould perfect his music. There is a clip where Gould is in a recording studio and we are listening to a play back of a recording he just made. He says that after listening to it that it is almost good. The recording seems to takes the soul out of music. He decides that he wants to re-record the track, so he prepares to play, but we don't see him play. The show is about a piano player but we never saw him playing the piano. It is possible that he hated the instrument that he is most known for. You would think that since this is a documentary about a piano player that you would get to see him play, but you don't. Is this out of respect for him, he is so into his music that it was about him and not his music. It could also be that the film is not about him but about who he was. A genius mind is very complex and often difficult or hard to understand. I think the film does well to try and portray the randomness of a genius mind in the style of non-linear film where we are forced to use our own minds to make the connections in the life of Glenn Gould.

    I for one loved the film. At first, I thought that the non-linear bit would wind up just being a gimmick, but I am happy to say my assumption was quite incorrect. If one is willing to put some effort into the film, rather than simply viewing it and really think about each film and its connection to the next short, there is some great content. My personal favorite was "Hamburg." It's all about the closing line in that one. If you haven't seen it, stop and think about this one in particular if you do. When you understand it, you'll get a great feel of how the film works. At times, though, it did get a bit tedious. Some shorts were not as interesting to watch--interesting to think about, though. All in all, I recommend it to anyone who has a little bit of time to think about it afterward, because that's where the satisfaction comes from.

    I'll admit, I'm a sucker for films about artists-- especially troubled eccentrics. Canadian Glenn Gould, one of the most celebrated and controversial pianists in history, is honored in this brilliant cinematic portrait. Rather than travel the middle-of-the-road, as did last year's biopic "Ray", director Francois Girard and screenwriter Don McKellar offer thirty-two vibrant, momentary glimpses of Gould's life, which combine, like the facets of a prism-- or the notes of a melody. Each short film is a piece of a puzzle that spans childhood to old age. While the styles vary from narrative to abstract, one constant is the hypnotic beat of Gould's genius fingers across the keyboard. Though I don't know a lot about classical music, this film made me hungry to learn more. There's a lovely scene where a hotel chambermaid falls spell to one of Gould's dazzling recordings. At that moment, so did I. Actor Colm Feore respectfully portrays the perfectionism, idealism, and anguish that eventually unraveled Gould's career. Oh, but what a career it was!

    the concept works. i like how the film is composed of individual films, yet the individual films do an excellent job of telling a singular, cohesive story. the best aspect is that we don't have to deal with the boring plot proceedings- we just fill in the blanks ourselves. learning about gould's personality through the dialogue kept my interest, but looking back, it was actually the strictly instrumental pieces that really kept my interest. fortunately gould's actual performances are mesmerizing enough on their own to really supplement the visuals. a couple of favorites off the top of my head are "man sitting in chair" and "a day's journal" (sorry, not the exact titles i think). colm feore, i've seen you in about a dozen pictures, but this is the one that made me really notice your name.

    Glenn Gould was a classical pianist of the first order. Made famous for his recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variation's, first in 1955 and then in 1981. As the short films show, Gould was an oddball with tremendous talent. He hummed along while playing, and was totally unaware of this quirk. The recording engineers were driven insane by this habit which can be heard on the final product. He was also a hypochondriac, constantly taking his own blood pressure and several medications simultaneously, which he chronicled in a diary. Some of the one to six minute segments are recreations, and others are interviews with people who knew him. The soundtrack is magnificent, for Gould's technique is breathtaking. Thirty Two Short Films is the story of a true genius whose life ended much too soon at the age of fifty, an almost self fulfilling prophecy, given the man's obsessive behavior. I loved this sad and beautiful movie.

    Let me preface this review by saying: the music of Bach permeates my existence. Over the years, I've listened to nearly every recording there is, repeatedly. That said, I had trouble watching this movie. The first time I tried, I quit after five minutes. Last evening, I made it all the way through. While at times moving, the film disturbs. For one, it does not do visual justice to the music. Bach's compositions are not about waving hands in the air, geometry animations, or men walking off into infinity. They're complex literary statements. This variety of music is akin to the best silent cinema; it says volumes, but without words. Like pantomime, it tells a nuanced story, weaving multiple plot lines together into an evocative fabric. Few of the 32 vignettes approached that ideal. Could it be that some of Bach's greatest admirers fail to grasp the deeper meaning within the music? In addition, Gould's personal faults grate on the nerves. It's clear he wasn't an ideal specimen. He mistook music for life. Music is a condiment, a catalyst perhaps. It frames life, drawing attention to worthy matters. It spices and enlivens life, making it savory. But it is not life. His mind was filled with picture frames, but no pictures. He fell in love with music in the same way that parrots sometimes mistakenly bond with their human owners. They are not parrots, and music is not a woman. One wonders how Bach might greet Gould in heaven: "So, the bachelor thinks he understands the man with two wives and twenty children? Let's see what kind of music you'll play after we give you a well-rounded life."

    This is a great film, and it goes into territories that few films even recognize, let alone approach. It does start a little slow, and the first few 'shorts' can come off as a bit ... well, pretentious, to be blunt. But past that, it's a fantastic portrait of an interesting character, and one which satisfies on a number of levels --- creatively, intellectually, and even emotionally. What sets this film aside from many others are two main elements; the first is the novelty by which the film is presented: 32 short films, some of which are quite the same, but many of which are unexpected blasts of what can only be called 'experimental film'--- some of which seems almost silly, given how far technology and special effects have come since 1993. The 'films' really are quite short, and many of them are almost like small 'puzzles' which unfold so quickly that it's not until a second viewing that their underlying message becomes a bit more obvious, and it becomes clear how well-tied together all the shorts are. This is not short-attention span theatre, but it moves quick enough that once you get into the film, it's difficult to stop watching. The other element which makes this film so great is the basic premise, and the way in which it refuses to be dumbed down for the audience. This is the rare case of a movie that respects it's audience, even at the expense of losing half an audience by not being bombastic and overly obvious. The first few shorts are the weakest, but they establish the basic character and 'backstory' of Gould quite well" He's a piano virtuoso who has become so amazing at playing piano that calling him 'genius' is a bit of an understatement. And while his character has a definite surplus of eccentricities and quirks, this film doesn't focus on his genius as we're used to seeing films treat the subject. Whereas most films make out a person;s genius to be a heavy burden to carry, which always seems to come at a high cost and lead to a desire for normalacy (to make we in the audience feel better for not being geniuses, I suppose), 32 Short Films goes in another direction: Here's a genius who enjoys being who he is, who makes the most of his mostly self-imposed loneliness by turning it into art, who enjoys the intellectual challenge of his own conflicts with intellectual society. Rather than the familiar portrait of genius as a soul-crippling condition which becomes almost indistinguishable from minor autism, we see a full human being, realized and thoughtful, able to confuse the sometimes-adoring, sometimes-confrontational media by admitting that he doesn't think it's worth talking about music--- how about talking about Indian rights, or the supernatural, or something that has no ostensible connection to music or anything piano-related? If you play music, or if you are an aficionado of classical music, there's a whole depth to this film which you'll enjoy, although it's not as at the forefront of the film as you might suspect. This is not a film about music, but the sort of person who plays music, recognizable as a character APART from the skill which defines him so much for everyone else. This movie is a bit dated. That's really one thing it has working against it in some sense--- it feels at times like a movie from the 80's, and not in a 'cool 80's' way. Nonetheless, there's a certain air to the film which seems to disregard any particular age entirely, and this makes sense in a way, because Gould was clearly not one to feel confined to the age, and the ways in which things were being done. There are so many things that are tempting to say about this film, which are probably just my own interpretations and conclusions, which it's probably better not to go into, simply because half the enjoyment of this film is developing those realizations yourself. Even if you can't stand classical music, you'll find this film rewarding. Highly recommended.

The recording seems to takes the soul out of music. He decides that he wants to re-record the track, so he prepares to play, but we don't see him play. The show is about a piano player but we never saw him playing the piano. It is possible that he hated the instrument that he is most known for. You would think that since this is a documentary about a piano player that you would get to see him play, but you don't. Is this out of respect for him, he is so into his music that it was about him and not his music. It could also be that the film is not about him but about who he was. A genius mind is very complex and often difficult or hard to understand. I think the film does well to try and portray the randomness of a genius mind in the style of non-linear film where we are forced to use our own minds to make the connections in the life of Glenn Gould.

    I for one loved the film. At first, I thought that the non-linear bit would wind up just being a gimmick, but I am happy to say my assumption was quite incorrect. If one is willing to put some effort into the film, rather than simply viewing it and really think about each film and its connection to the next short, there is some great content. My personal favorite was "Hamburg." It's all about the closing line in that one. If you haven't seen it, stop and think about this one in particular if you do. When you understand it, you'll get a great feel of how the film works. At times, though, it did get a bit tedious. Some shorts were not as interesting to watch--interesting to think about, though. All in all, I recommend it to anyone who has a little bit of time to think about it afterward, because that's where the satisfaction comes from.

    I'll admit, I'm a sucker for films about artists-- especially troubled eccentrics. Canadian Glenn Gould, one of the most celebrated and controversial pianists in history, is honored in this brilliant cinematic portrait. Rather than travel the middle-of-the-road, as did last year's biopic "Ray", director Francois Girard and screenwriter Don McKellar offer thirty-two vibrant, momentary glimpses of Gould's life, which combine, like the facets of a prism-- or the notes of a melody. Each short film is a piece of a puzzle that spans childhood to old age. While the styles vary from narrative to abstract, one constant is the hypnotic beat of Gould's genius fingers across the keyboard. Though I don't know a lot about classical music, this film made me hungry to learn more. There's a lovely scene where a hotel chambermaid falls spell to one of Gould's dazzling recordings. At that moment, so did I. Actor Colm Feore respectfully portrays the perfectionism, idealism, and anguish that eventually unraveled Gould's career. Oh, but what a career it was!

    the concept works. i like how the film is composed of individual films, yet the individual films do an excellent job of telling a singular, cohesive story. the best aspect is that we don't have to deal with the boring plot proceedings- we just fill in the blanks ourselves. learning about gould's personality through the dialogue kept my interest, but looking back, it was actually the strictly instrumental pieces that really kept my interest. fortunately gould's actual performances are mesmerizing enough on their own to really supplement the visuals. a couple of favorites off the top of my head are "man sitting in chair" and "a day's journal" (sorry, not the exact titles i think). colm feore, i've seen you in about a dozen pictures, but this is the one that made me really notice your name.
