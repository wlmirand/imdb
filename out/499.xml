 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The fifth Tennessee Williams play to reach the screen, wealthy Mississippi plantation owner Big Daddy Pollitt, unaware that he's dying of cancer and disturbed by the strained and childless marriage of his favored alcoholic son Brick and his other son, Gooper, whose wife is about to bring forth another in the endless line of little "no-neck monsters," celebrates his sixty-fifth birthday with his family. Brick's wife, Maggie, beautiful and desirable, tries unsuccessfully to coax her husband away from the bottle, while alternately enticing him and taunting him about his obsession with his deceased best friend and the guilt about their relationship. The seamy tensions reach a climax when the truth of Big Daddy's health is revealed, and he and Brick manage to resolve their differences.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension.

It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today.

A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

    Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates. The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk! Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether. Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves. Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least. www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in

    Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player, drinks his days away and resists the affections of his wife, Maggie. His reunion with his father, Big Daddy, who is dying of cancer, jogs a host of memories and revelations for both father and son. First, I have to say it is a shame that Hollywood had to whitewash this film and remove the homosexual references from the script. While I feel Brick's homosexuality is still strongly hinted at (his affection for Skipper is a bit extreme), it does change the entire love triangle aspect of the film. I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision. Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.

    The "Actors Studio" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the "method acting" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get "inside their characters" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied..."you will never catch him ACTING". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that "method" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)

    They don't make 'em like they used to. I know, I know; that's a hoary old clich&eacute;. But it's also true. This is a movie about disaffected relationships and the deceits employed to sustain them. Newman is at his disaffected best and I think you can see where the inspiration for 'Cool Hand Luke' derived. Each opens with the antics of a drunken misfit who goes on to denounce every expectation levied upon him. Taylor is at the height of both her physical and acting prowess, securing her second Oscar as his wife Maggie. But Burl Ives almost upstages the pair with a demonstration of pompous vulnerability that is mesmerizing to see. Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell. For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity. If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.

    Perhaps the original "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae ("Sister Woman") in her battle with "Maggie the Cat". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was hot. From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy "sister woman" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own "Big Daddy" type on "Guiding Light") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little "Bad Seed" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton. Fans of "The Flying Nun" will be shocked to see the future "Reverand Mother" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for "The Big Country" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of "Mendacity!" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them. Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.

    A perfect play to film adaptation. Simple yet sophisticated, its one of those movies that you simply watch not for its fancy effects or dazzling action but by the quality and perfection of the actors and plot. A genuine drama film to the bone marrow. A true masterpiece that glitters as a beacon of the mid 20th century I feel this movie defines the charisma of the films of the time, a plain set a small cast and yet a wonderfully charming film. Paul Newman was certainly the most powerful actor followed by Burl Ives and then Liz Taylor. Truly a spotlight of their careers these actors deliver marvelous performance. Without me being mendacious(like Brick Pollitt would have said), I would like to mention Jack Carson who delivers a fine supporting act. As such o believe this film deserves an 9/10. Quality above quantity, this movie might not be a full on cinematographic wonder or have amusing effects but it certainly replaces those with powerful acting and quality dialogs.

    Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks. Set in the American South, "Cat" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate. Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot. The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being "emotionally confused." As filmed theatre, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's "Ran", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic. 7.5/10 Â– Worth one viewing.

    "The truth? You can't handle the truth." ~Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men "There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!" ~Burl Ives as Big Daddy Last week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Burl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early. Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie. Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had "big time" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart. Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the "Big Daddy" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up. In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either. The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned. The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey. As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal. They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge. This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with. If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play. As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.

If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects. Here's as good a reason as any. Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away. I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time. Story is something that happens to people we can care about, and I cared about all these characters by the end.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is based off of a play. As with any great play, it will have a different fluidity to it then just a normal film, that's not based off of a play, will. The Delineation of any great play is to always keep discovering things and to keep the story going, to keep it going forward, discovering, and discovering. On the other hand, with any normal film not based off of a play, there really are no rules, a film can go anywhere it pleases. So with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it is based off of a Tennessee Williams Play and it will play on film like a play as well. It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though. Burl Ives, in my opinion, really stood out, but he unfortunately got snubbed an academy award nomination for this film. Overall, a good solid film though.

    Depressing story of "southern misery." Quite dated sensuality.

    I knew this movie was considered a classic because of Ms. Taylor's work. However, I was totally unaware of the gist of the story. After watching about half of the movie I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters are, bluntly, all in misery. Big Daddy abhors his wife, as does Brick, who lives only to drink. Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me. I was amazed at what this story could possibly contribute to what would be considered 'entertainment.' Luckily I spent only one dollar at the thrift store and spent only about 30 minutes in watching it.
