    Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends co-workers. They thought they discovered a serious discrepancy in some payouts to life insurances by the company. They show it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), but they didn't know that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud. When Bernie ask the mob to kill the two clueless fools, they instead had Bernie killed. When Larry and Richard finds Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the fun party going. It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. It is stupid but there's enough cute moments to allow me to watch it.

    Weekend at Bernie's Realistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate. However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction. After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter. But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive. Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time. While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated. Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of "Hampton Island" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities. As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.

    Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company. When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women. But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women..... First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear. But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish. A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky. The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable. It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.

    Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about... This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.

    Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain. Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living. Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is "playing" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown. The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings. Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him. They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him. The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies. What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent. Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right. Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.

    Both McCarthy and Silverman were brat-packer b-s who never quite made it all the way. Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible. For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast. I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.

    A couple of cute, rambunctious, big city insurance hackers get invited to a swinging beach party, only to find their host dead of an apparent drug overdose. The End. There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.

    Much like the billybrown review, I loved this movie too. I know it got slammed by critics, but if you watch purely for the slapstick humor, there should be no reason you aren't satisfied. Yes, there are some unbelievable parts to the movie, but you get that with slapstick humor. For instance, when Bernie's dead body gets washed out to sea, it gets washed up again only minutes later a few hundred yards down the beach. Anyone who knows anything about high and low tides will tell you this is virtually impossible. But like I said, if you ignore the mechanics of the plot, it is a hysterically funny movie. By far my favorite part is when Bernie falls out of the boat and is dragged behind, repeatedly hitting the large metal channel markers with a loud thud. Even though this movie is now 20 years old and I've seen it dozens of times, I still laugh to the point of nearly wetting myself every time that scene comes on.

    "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those classic 80's movies that has a fan following. This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny. Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend. It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead. Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house. Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film. "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

    "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those classic 80's movies that has a fan following. This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny. Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend. It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead. Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house. Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film. "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

    Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends co-workers. They thought they discovered a serious discrepancy in some payouts to life insurances by the company. They show it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), but they didn't know that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud. When Bernie ask the mob to kill the two clueless fools, they instead had Bernie killed. When Larry and Richard finds Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the fun party going. It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. It is stupid but there's enough cute moments to allow me to watch it.

    Weekend at Bernie's Realistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate. However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction. After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter. But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive. Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time. While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated. Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of "Hampton Island" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities. As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.

    Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company. When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women. But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women..... First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear. But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish. A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky. The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable. It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.

    Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about... This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.

    Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain. Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living. Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is "playing" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown. The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings. Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him. They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him. The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies. What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent. Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right. Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.

    Both McCarthy and Silverman were brat-packer b-s who never quite made it all the way. Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible. For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast. I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.

    A couple of cute, rambunctious, big city insurance hackers get invited to a swinging beach party, only to find their host dead of an apparent drug overdose. The End. There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.

    Much like the billybrown review, I loved this movie too. I know it got slammed by critics, but if you watch purely for the slapstick humor, there should be no reason you aren't satisfied. Yes, there are some unbelievable parts to the movie, but you get that with slapstick humor. For instance, when Bernie's dead body gets washed out to sea, it gets washed up again only minutes later a few hundred yards down the beach. Anyone who knows anything about high and low tides will tell you this is virtually impossible. But like I said, if you ignore the mechanics of the plot, it is a hysterically funny movie. By far my favorite part is when Bernie falls out of the boat and is dragged behind, repeatedly hitting the large metal channel markers with a loud thud. Even though this movie is now 20 years old and I've seen it dozens of times, I still laugh to the point of nearly wetting myself every time that scene comes on.

    "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those classic 80's movies that has a fan following. This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny. Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend. It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead. Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house. Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film. "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

    Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends co-workers. They thought they discovered a serious discrepancy in some payouts to life insurances by the company. They show it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), but they didn't know that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud. When Bernie ask the mob to kill the two clueless fools, they instead had Bernie killed. When Larry and Richard finds Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the fun party going. It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. It is stupid but there's enough cute moments to allow me to watch it.

    Weekend at Bernie's Realistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate. However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction. After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter. But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive. Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time. While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated. Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of "Hampton Island" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities. As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.

    Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company. When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women. But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women..... First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear. But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish. A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky. The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable. It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.

    Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about... This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.

    Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain. Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living. Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is "playing" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown. The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings. Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him. They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him. The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies. What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent. Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right. Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.

    Both McCarthy and Silverman were brat-packer b-s who never quite made it all the way. Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible. For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast. I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.

    A couple of cute, rambunctious, big city insurance hackers get invited to a swinging beach party, only to find their host dead of an apparent drug overdose. The End. There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.

    Much like the billybrown review, I loved this movie too. I know it got slammed by critics, but if you watch purely for the slapstick humor, there should be no reason you aren't satisfied. Yes, there are some unbelievable parts to the movie, but you get that with slapstick humor. For instance, when Bernie's dead body gets washed out to sea, it gets washed up again only minutes later a few hundred yards down the beach. Anyone who knows anything about high and low tides will tell you this is virtually impossible. But like I said, if you ignore the mechanics of the plot, it is a hysterically funny movie. By far my favorite part is when Bernie falls out of the boat and is dragged behind, repeatedly hitting the large metal channel markers with a loud thud. Even though this movie is now 20 years old and I've seen it dozens of times, I still laugh to the point of nearly wetting myself every time that scene comes on.

This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny. Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend. It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead. Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house. Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film. "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

    Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends co-workers. They thought they discovered a serious discrepancy in some payouts to life insurances by the company. They show it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), but they didn't know that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud. When Bernie ask the mob to kill the two clueless fools, they instead had Bernie killed. When Larry and Richard finds Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the fun party going. It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. It is stupid but there's enough cute moments to allow me to watch it.

    Weekend at Bernie's Realistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate. However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction. After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter. But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive. Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time. While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated. Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of "Hampton Island" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities. As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.

    Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company. When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women. But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women..... First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear. But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish. A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky. The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable. It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.

    Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about... This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.

    Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain. Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living. Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is "playing" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown. The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings. Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him. They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him. The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies. What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent. Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right. Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.

    Both McCarthy and Silverman were brat-packer b-s who never quite made it all the way. Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible. For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast. I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.

    A couple of cute, rambunctious, big city insurance hackers get invited to a swinging beach party, only to find their host dead of an apparent drug overdose. The End. There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.

    Much like the billybrown review, I loved this movie too. I know it got slammed by critics, but if you watch purely for the slapstick humor, there should be no reason you aren't satisfied. Yes, there are some unbelievable parts to the movie, but you get that with slapstick humor. For instance, when Bernie's dead body gets washed out to sea, it gets washed up again only minutes later a few hundred yards down the beach. Anyone who knows anything about high and low tides will tell you this is virtually impossible. But like I said, if you ignore the mechanics of the plot, it is a hysterically funny movie. By far my favorite part is when Bernie falls out of the boat and is dragged behind, repeatedly hitting the large metal channel markers with a loud thud. Even though this movie is now 20 years old and I've seen it dozens of times, I still laugh to the point of nearly wetting myself every time that scene comes on.

This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny. Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend. It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead. Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house. Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film. "Weekend at Bernie's" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

    Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends co-workers. They thought they discovered a serious discrepancy in some payouts to life insurances by the company. They show it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), but they didn't know that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud. When Bernie ask the mob to kill the two clueless fools, they instead had Bernie killed. When Larry and Richard finds Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the fun party going. It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. It is stupid but there's enough cute moments to allow me to watch it.

    Weekend at Bernie's Realistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate. However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction. After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter. But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive. Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time. While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated. Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of "Hampton Island" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities. As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.

    Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company. When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women. But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women..... First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear. But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish. A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky. The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable. It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.

    Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about... This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.

    Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain. Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living. Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is "playing" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown. The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings. Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him. They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him. The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies. What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent. Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right. Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.

    Both McCarthy and Silverman were brat-packer b-s who never quite made it all the way. Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible. For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast. I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.

    A couple of cute, rambunctious, big city insurance hackers get invited to a swinging beach party, only to find their host dead of an apparent drug overdose. The End. There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.

    Much like the billybrown review, I loved this movie too. I know it got slammed by critics, but if you watch purely for the slapstick humor, there should be no reason you aren't satisfied. Yes, there are some unbelievable parts to the movie, but you get that with slapstick humor. For instance, when Bernie's dead body gets washed out to sea, it gets washed up again only minutes later a few hundred yards down the beach. Anyone who knows anything about high and low tides will tell you this is virtually impossible. But like I said, if you ignore the mechanics of the plot, it is a hysterically funny movie. By far my favorite part is when Bernie falls out of the boat and is dragged behind, repeatedly hitting the large metal channel markers with a loud thud. Even though this movie is now 20 years old and I've seen it dozens of times, I still laugh to the point of nearly wetting myself every time that scene comes on.
