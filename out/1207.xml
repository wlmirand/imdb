    A wealthy art collector (and admirer of world leaders Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard M. Nixon) is murdered in his San Francisco mansion. Due to repeated chops with a hatchet, there is an abundance of blood. Along with many pricey artifacts, the dead man has an amply supply of sex paraphernalia. His most prized possession appears to be a collection of his partners' pubic hair. Four hours later, red-haired assistant district attorney David Caruso (as David Corelli) is at a dance attended by still sexy old flame Linda Fiorentino (as Anna Katrina "Trina" Maxwell). He still longs for her, but she married best friend Chazz Palminteri (as Matt Gavin), a rich defense lawyer. Employed to investigate, Mr. Caruso finds a cuff-link at the murder scene. Curiously, he decides to withhold it from other collected evidence... The cuff-link is from "The Golden Bay Club" where Caruso and Mr. Palminteri are members. Also discovered is the murder victim's collection of pornographic pictures. Most importantly, there are photographs of California Governor Richard Crenna (as Lew Edwards) with a young prostitute. Caruso confronts Mr. Crenna with the dirty pictures and is threateningly told he has a future in State politics comparable to Jerry Brown - a line they must regret, as Mr. Brown is presently serving an historic term as Governor. Everything seems to come together in an intriguing web of sex, mystery and murder. But, by the end, "Jade" proves looks can be deceiving. This is a puzzle with pieces shoved into place, by director William Friedkin. He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent. ***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna

    Well, everybody probably knows how erotic suspenseful thrillers used to be in 90's, and this movie is no exception. As every movie with such specific subject, "Jade" begins with a main suspect of committing a murderer. In this kind of movie, sometimes he turns out to be the real killer, whilst in other times, it is someone we'd never expect. Trina had everything to be the murder out there; I strongly thought so when she said "ask that girl if I'm jade", since I believed she already knew that girl was dead and was playing fool. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have tension scenes to develop a remarkable movie, being too light most of the time. In the last scenes we have a distinct reference to 1980's "The Shining", whether William Friedkin admits it or not. It is, all in all, an entertaining film in every aspect, but never truly gives what you might wish for a suspenseful night.

    Although Jade has interesting stars and high production values, not to mention a famous director and a screenwriter who knew the terrain, its flaws are really quite basic  "Basic Instinct" in fact. It is hard to see "Jade" as anything other than a repackaging of "Basic Instinct" made two years before. Both have scripts by Joe Eszterhas  and it's much the same script. That is to say the basic formula is much the same. Both "Basic Instinct" and "Jade" feature women who have a dark side, which they can barely control. Much pseudo psychological claptrap is woven through both films. The telling difference is in the direction. Paul Veerhoven's "Basic Instinct" had a fluid style, which combined with a seductive Jerry Goldsmith score gave it surprising depth. Friedkin was less successful in disguising the thinness of the material. The movie begins with the murder of a well-known art collector, Kyle Medford. District attorney, David Corelli, played by David Caruso, is called to the crime scene. Kyle Medford has been hacked to death with an antique hatchet and crucified to a wall. "This is rage", says Corelli as he inspects the corpse. David Caruso incorporates a great deal of body language into his roles. In fact, he often contorts his posture to the point where he almost seems to be trying out for the part of Richard III. The mannerisms he brought to full flower as Horatio Caine in "CSI Miami", can be seen in the developmental stage in "Jade" including the loose stance with hands on the hips, the head slightly cocked or turned to the side indicating deep thought, and the Caruso specialty  the slow boil with his words delivered in measured tones as he struggles to control his emotions. As the story unfolds, it appears that Kyle Medford filmed prominent citizens in compromising situations and kept the pictures. Corelli discovers that these men, including the governor, all wanted a woman called Jade. As far as the governor is concerned, "Jade really rocked his world". Pictures found at Medford's beach house show Trina Gavin, played by Linda Fiorentino, having sex with a man. Trina Gavin is a leading clinical psychologist. In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men  she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri. Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in "The French Connection", tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in "Jade" but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets. After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed  although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's "Rites of Spring", and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness. The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

    Sleazy, lurid, and kinky. A murder mystery in the trashy tradition of paperbacks and post censorship Hollywood done with a glossy style and a bit of swagger that befits this type of thing. The confusing plot does not allow for too much intellectual intrigue but has enough of a thread to keep things moving from one set piece to another. The Director reaches into his briefcase of blue and sets off a series of sexually oriented, rather raunchy rants, counterpointed by some exciting, offbeat violence and chases. It is a bit too clever for its own good and the complexity is confrontational to the B-movie charm that is the best of this. Visually stunning in parts, but if you are prudish or turned-off by soft-core sex and uncomfortable discourse about intercourse, this may not be for you.

    Jade is the kind of cinema where the director who has some genuine talent and vision, if not consistently then strong when the iron hits, has to try and make something out of hackwork. Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all. Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing. So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable. Maybe I'll even revisit it at 3 in the morning on cable.

    When the assistant district attorney of San Francisco investigates the mysterious death of an important millionaire he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his who is married to an important lawyer. Now it is difficult for him to distinguish between what is reality and what should be reality.... Yes there are many similarities to this, Basic Instinct, and even Body of Evidence, but is that really a bad thing? This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat. Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film. There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

    Ignoring a plot line that is recycled, a climax that is a bit shaky with a twist that is strangely predictable, I'd say Jade could pass for an entertaining neo-noir. Starting with a delicious title sequence, the movie is stepped mostly in style. Something about it recalls Brian de Palma. Within the frame, it is staged quite theatrically, and it works. Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

    This is a Basic Instict rehash plain and simple, actually it's a pre draft of basic instict. The directing is a mess, I can't believe this guy shot the french connection. But now he's old and where he tries to be different here, he is instead just plainly bad...Tight close ups for no reasons, boring set scenes, saturated photography...the cast is decent but with such a trite script...the dialog is worse than trivial. Its only saving grace is an unintended one, and maybe with that meditation in mind this can actually become a good film: Because the grotesqueness, blandness and stupidity in the realisation and script of this film reflects the world of powerless unsexual morons acting all powerful and sexual. Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I 've never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility. A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. It could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind.

    ***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and totally confusing thriller that has assistant D.A David Carelli, David Caruso, on the hunt for those who brutally sliced up and murdered a serial blackmailer who got way over his head in those he was blackmailing. Found cut to shreds in his mansion among his very expensive antiques, mostly from the Orient, Kyle Medford, Ron Ulsatd, sleazy and secret life as a master blackmailer hit the front pages of the local as well as national newspapers. It's Corelli who takes a very personal interest in Medford's murder only because his ex-girlfriend Trina Gavin, Linda Fiorentino,was one of the last persons to see him alive. This doesn't sit well with Trina's husband high powered defense attorney Matt Gavin, Chazz Palminteri,who feels that Corelli is using Medford's murder in making a play for his wife. Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast. It's there where Medford ran a prostitution ring, right out of his beach front house, that he used to attract very important people in the state to engage in. Getting the goods on the unsuspecting John's Medford would film them in action and use the photos and video tapes to blackmail them. The movies disjointed storyline has Corelli uncover a plot to blackmail the states top executive Governor Gov. Lew Edwards, Richard Crenna, by having him photographed in action with a hooker at Medford's beach house. When Corelli finally tracks down the hooker who "The Gov" was partying with-Patrice Jacinto played by Angie Evenhart-she clams up and refuses to give him anything but her name and occupation. Slowly putting the pieces together Corelli soon realizes that there was a lot more going on then just simple blackmail! It's murder for both power and profit on the highest order. And possibly Even higher then the governor of the state of California himself! And it's Corelli, by sticking his nose into the matter, who's next on the killer or killer's hit list! The film "Jade" was so badly mishandled by its director William Friedkin that its screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tried to get his name off the movie's credits. As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising, after the far more superior "Kiss of Death", movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows. The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in "The French Connection". There was also a number of X-rated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green, Robin Thomas, who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him. ***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer, that Corelli illegally audio taped, for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.

This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable. Maybe I'll even revisit it at 3 in the morning on cable.

    When the assistant district attorney of San Francisco investigates the mysterious death of an important millionaire he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his who is married to an important lawyer. Now it is difficult for him to distinguish between what is reality and what should be reality.... Yes there are many similarities to this, Basic Instinct, and even Body of Evidence, but is that really a bad thing? This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat. Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film. There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

    Ignoring a plot line that is recycled, a climax that is a bit shaky with a twist that is strangely predictable, I'd say Jade could pass for an entertaining neo-noir. Starting with a delicious title sequence, the movie is stepped mostly in style. Something about it recalls Brian de Palma. Within the frame, it is staged quite theatrically, and it works. Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

    This is a Basic Instict rehash plain and simple, actually it's a pre draft of basic instict. The directing is a mess, I can't believe this guy shot the french connection. But now he's old and where he tries to be different here, he is instead just plainly bad...Tight close ups for no reasons, boring set scenes, saturated photography...the cast is decent but with such a trite script...the dialog is worse than trivial. Its only saving grace is an unintended one, and maybe with that meditation in mind this can actually become a good film: Because the grotesqueness, blandness and stupidity in the realisation and script of this film reflects the world of powerless unsexual morons acting all powerful and sexual. Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I 've never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility. A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. It could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind.

    ***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and totally confusing thriller that has assistant D.A David Carelli, David Caruso, on the hunt for those who brutally sliced up and murdered a serial blackmailer who got way over his head in those he was blackmailing. Found cut to shreds in his mansion among his very expensive antiques, mostly from the Orient, Kyle Medford, Ron Ulsatd, sleazy and secret life as a master blackmailer hit the front pages of the local as well as national newspapers. It's Corelli who takes a very personal interest in Medford's murder only because his ex-girlfriend Trina Gavin, Linda Fiorentino,was one of the last persons to see him alive. This doesn't sit well with Trina's husband high powered defense attorney Matt Gavin, Chazz Palminteri,who feels that Corelli is using Medford's murder in making a play for his wife. Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast. It's there where Medford ran a prostitution ring, right out of his beach front house, that he used to attract very important people in the state to engage in. Getting the goods on the unsuspecting John's Medford would film them in action and use the photos and video tapes to blackmail them. The movies disjointed storyline has Corelli uncover a plot to blackmail the states top executive Governor Gov. Lew Edwards, Richard Crenna, by having him photographed in action with a hooker at Medford's beach house. When Corelli finally tracks down the hooker who "The Gov" was partying with-Patrice Jacinto played by Angie Evenhart-she clams up and refuses to give him anything but her name and occupation. Slowly putting the pieces together Corelli soon realizes that there was a lot more going on then just simple blackmail! It's murder for both power and profit on the highest order. And possibly Even higher then the governor of the state of California himself! And it's Corelli, by sticking his nose into the matter, who's next on the killer or killer's hit list! The film "Jade" was so badly mishandled by its director William Friedkin that its screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tried to get his name off the movie's credits. As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising, after the far more superior "Kiss of Death", movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows. The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in "The French Connection". There was also a number of X-rated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green, Robin Thomas, who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him. ***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer, that Corelli illegally audio taped, for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.

    A wealthy art collector (and admirer of world leaders Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard M. Nixon) is murdered in his San Francisco mansion. Due to repeated chops with a hatchet, there is an abundance of blood. Along with many pricey artifacts, the dead man has an amply supply of sex paraphernalia. His most prized possession appears to be a collection of his partners' pubic hair. Four hours later, red-haired assistant district attorney David Caruso (as David Corelli) is at a dance attended by still sexy old flame Linda Fiorentino (as Anna Katrina "Trina" Maxwell). He still longs for her, but she married best friend Chazz Palminteri (as Matt Gavin), a rich defense lawyer. Employed to investigate, Mr. Caruso finds a cuff-link at the murder scene. Curiously, he decides to withhold it from other collected evidence... The cuff-link is from "The Golden Bay Club" where Caruso and Mr. Palminteri are members. Also discovered is the murder victim's collection of pornographic pictures. Most importantly, there are photographs of California Governor Richard Crenna (as Lew Edwards) with a young prostitute. Caruso confronts Mr. Crenna with the dirty pictures and is threateningly told he has a future in State politics comparable to Jerry Brown - a line they must regret, as Mr. Brown is presently serving an historic term as Governor. Everything seems to come together in an intriguing web of sex, mystery and murder. But, by the end, "Jade" proves looks can be deceiving. This is a puzzle with pieces shoved into place, by director William Friedkin. He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent. ***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna

    Well, everybody probably knows how erotic suspenseful thrillers used to be in 90's, and this movie is no exception. As every movie with such specific subject, "Jade" begins with a main suspect of committing a murderer. In this kind of movie, sometimes he turns out to be the real killer, whilst in other times, it is someone we'd never expect. Trina had everything to be the murder out there; I strongly thought so when she said "ask that girl if I'm jade", since I believed she already knew that girl was dead and was playing fool. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have tension scenes to develop a remarkable movie, being too light most of the time. In the last scenes we have a distinct reference to 1980's "The Shining", whether William Friedkin admits it or not. It is, all in all, an entertaining film in every aspect, but never truly gives what you might wish for a suspenseful night.

    Although Jade has interesting stars and high production values, not to mention a famous director and a screenwriter who knew the terrain, its flaws are really quite basic  "Basic Instinct" in fact. It is hard to see "Jade" as anything other than a repackaging of "Basic Instinct" made two years before. Both have scripts by Joe Eszterhas  and it's much the same script. That is to say the basic formula is much the same. Both "Basic Instinct" and "Jade" feature women who have a dark side, which they can barely control. Much pseudo psychological claptrap is woven through both films. The telling difference is in the direction. Paul Veerhoven's "Basic Instinct" had a fluid style, which combined with a seductive Jerry Goldsmith score gave it surprising depth. Friedkin was less successful in disguising the thinness of the material. The movie begins with the murder of a well-known art collector, Kyle Medford. District attorney, David Corelli, played by David Caruso, is called to the crime scene. Kyle Medford has been hacked to death with an antique hatchet and crucified to a wall. "This is rage", says Corelli as he inspects the corpse. David Caruso incorporates a great deal of body language into his roles. In fact, he often contorts his posture to the point where he almost seems to be trying out for the part of Richard III. The mannerisms he brought to full flower as Horatio Caine in "CSI Miami", can be seen in the developmental stage in "Jade" including the loose stance with hands on the hips, the head slightly cocked or turned to the side indicating deep thought, and the Caruso specialty  the slow boil with his words delivered in measured tones as he struggles to control his emotions. As the story unfolds, it appears that Kyle Medford filmed prominent citizens in compromising situations and kept the pictures. Corelli discovers that these men, including the governor, all wanted a woman called Jade. As far as the governor is concerned, "Jade really rocked his world". Pictures found at Medford's beach house show Trina Gavin, played by Linda Fiorentino, having sex with a man. Trina Gavin is a leading clinical psychologist. In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men  she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri. Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in "The French Connection", tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in "Jade" but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets. After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed  although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's "Rites of Spring", and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness. The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

    Sleazy, lurid, and kinky. A murder mystery in the trashy tradition of paperbacks and post censorship Hollywood done with a glossy style and a bit of swagger that befits this type of thing. The confusing plot does not allow for too much intellectual intrigue but has enough of a thread to keep things moving from one set piece to another. The Director reaches into his briefcase of blue and sets off a series of sexually oriented, rather raunchy rants, counterpointed by some exciting, offbeat violence and chases. It is a bit too clever for its own good and the complexity is confrontational to the B-movie charm that is the best of this. Visually stunning in parts, but if you are prudish or turned-off by soft-core sex and uncomfortable discourse about intercourse, this may not be for you.

    Jade is the kind of cinema where the director who has some genuine talent and vision, if not consistently then strong when the iron hits, has to try and make something out of hackwork. Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all. Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing. So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

    A wealthy art collector (and admirer of world leaders Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard M. Nixon) is murdered in his San Francisco mansion. Due to repeated chops with a hatchet, there is an abundance of blood. Along with many pricey artifacts, the dead man has an amply supply of sex paraphernalia. His most prized possession appears to be a collection of his partners' pubic hair. Four hours later, red-haired assistant district attorney David Caruso (as David Corelli) is at a dance attended by still sexy old flame Linda Fiorentino (as Anna Katrina "Trina" Maxwell). He still longs for her, but she married best friend Chazz Palminteri (as Matt Gavin), a rich defense lawyer. Employed to investigate, Mr. Caruso finds a cuff-link at the murder scene. Curiously, he decides to withhold it from other collected evidence... The cuff-link is from "The Golden Bay Club" where Caruso and Mr. Palminteri are members. Also discovered is the murder victim's collection of pornographic pictures. Most importantly, there are photographs of California Governor Richard Crenna (as Lew Edwards) with a young prostitute. Caruso confronts Mr. Crenna with the dirty pictures and is threateningly told he has a future in State politics comparable to Jerry Brown - a line they must regret, as Mr. Brown is presently serving an historic term as Governor. Everything seems to come together in an intriguing web of sex, mystery and murder. But, by the end, "Jade" proves looks can be deceiving. This is a puzzle with pieces shoved into place, by director William Friedkin. He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent. ***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna

    Well, everybody probably knows how erotic suspenseful thrillers used to be in 90's, and this movie is no exception. As every movie with such specific subject, "Jade" begins with a main suspect of committing a murderer. In this kind of movie, sometimes he turns out to be the real killer, whilst in other times, it is someone we'd never expect. Trina had everything to be the murder out there; I strongly thought so when she said "ask that girl if I'm jade", since I believed she already knew that girl was dead and was playing fool. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have tension scenes to develop a remarkable movie, being too light most of the time. In the last scenes we have a distinct reference to 1980's "The Shining", whether William Friedkin admits it or not. It is, all in all, an entertaining film in every aspect, but never truly gives what you might wish for a suspenseful night.

    Although Jade has interesting stars and high production values, not to mention a famous director and a screenwriter who knew the terrain, its flaws are really quite basic  "Basic Instinct" in fact. It is hard to see "Jade" as anything other than a repackaging of "Basic Instinct" made two years before. Both have scripts by Joe Eszterhas  and it's much the same script. That is to say the basic formula is much the same. Both "Basic Instinct" and "Jade" feature women who have a dark side, which they can barely control. Much pseudo psychological claptrap is woven through both films. The telling difference is in the direction. Paul Veerhoven's "Basic Instinct" had a fluid style, which combined with a seductive Jerry Goldsmith score gave it surprising depth. Friedkin was less successful in disguising the thinness of the material. The movie begins with the murder of a well-known art collector, Kyle Medford. District attorney, David Corelli, played by David Caruso, is called to the crime scene. Kyle Medford has been hacked to death with an antique hatchet and crucified to a wall. "This is rage", says Corelli as he inspects the corpse. David Caruso incorporates a great deal of body language into his roles. In fact, he often contorts his posture to the point where he almost seems to be trying out for the part of Richard III. The mannerisms he brought to full flower as Horatio Caine in "CSI Miami", can be seen in the developmental stage in "Jade" including the loose stance with hands on the hips, the head slightly cocked or turned to the side indicating deep thought, and the Caruso specialty  the slow boil with his words delivered in measured tones as he struggles to control his emotions. As the story unfolds, it appears that Kyle Medford filmed prominent citizens in compromising situations and kept the pictures. Corelli discovers that these men, including the governor, all wanted a woman called Jade. As far as the governor is concerned, "Jade really rocked his world". Pictures found at Medford's beach house show Trina Gavin, played by Linda Fiorentino, having sex with a man. Trina Gavin is a leading clinical psychologist. In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men  she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri. Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in "The French Connection", tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in "Jade" but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets. After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed  although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's "Rites of Spring", and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness. The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

    Sleazy, lurid, and kinky. A murder mystery in the trashy tradition of paperbacks and post censorship Hollywood done with a glossy style and a bit of swagger that befits this type of thing. The confusing plot does not allow for too much intellectual intrigue but has enough of a thread to keep things moving from one set piece to another. The Director reaches into his briefcase of blue and sets off a series of sexually oriented, rather raunchy rants, counterpointed by some exciting, offbeat violence and chases. It is a bit too clever for its own good and the complexity is confrontational to the B-movie charm that is the best of this. Visually stunning in parts, but if you are prudish or turned-off by soft-core sex and uncomfortable discourse about intercourse, this may not be for you.

    Jade is the kind of cinema where the director who has some genuine talent and vision, if not consistently then strong when the iron hits, has to try and make something out of hackwork. Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all. Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing. So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable. Maybe I'll even revisit it at 3 in the morning on cable.

    When the assistant district attorney of San Francisco investigates the mysterious death of an important millionaire he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his who is married to an important lawyer. Now it is difficult for him to distinguish between what is reality and what should be reality.... Yes there are many similarities to this, Basic Instinct, and even Body of Evidence, but is that really a bad thing? This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat. Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film. There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

    Ignoring a plot line that is recycled, a climax that is a bit shaky with a twist that is strangely predictable, I'd say Jade could pass for an entertaining neo-noir. Starting with a delicious title sequence, the movie is stepped mostly in style. Something about it recalls Brian de Palma. Within the frame, it is staged quite theatrically, and it works. Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

    This is a Basic Instict rehash plain and simple, actually it's a pre draft of basic instict. The directing is a mess, I can't believe this guy shot the french connection. But now he's old and where he tries to be different here, he is instead just plainly bad...Tight close ups for no reasons, boring set scenes, saturated photography...the cast is decent but with such a trite script...the dialog is worse than trivial. Its only saving grace is an unintended one, and maybe with that meditation in mind this can actually become a good film: Because the grotesqueness, blandness and stupidity in the realisation and script of this film reflects the world of powerless unsexual morons acting all powerful and sexual. Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I 've never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility. A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. It could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind.

    ***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and totally confusing thriller that has assistant D.A David Carelli, David Caruso, on the hunt for those who brutally sliced up and murdered a serial blackmailer who got way over his head in those he was blackmailing. Found cut to shreds in his mansion among his very expensive antiques, mostly from the Orient, Kyle Medford, Ron Ulsatd, sleazy and secret life as a master blackmailer hit the front pages of the local as well as national newspapers. It's Corelli who takes a very personal interest in Medford's murder only because his ex-girlfriend Trina Gavin, Linda Fiorentino,was one of the last persons to see him alive. This doesn't sit well with Trina's husband high powered defense attorney Matt Gavin, Chazz Palminteri,who feels that Corelli is using Medford's murder in making a play for his wife. Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast. It's there where Medford ran a prostitution ring, right out of his beach front house, that he used to attract very important people in the state to engage in. Getting the goods on the unsuspecting John's Medford would film them in action and use the photos and video tapes to blackmail them. The movies disjointed storyline has Corelli uncover a plot to blackmail the states top executive Governor Gov. Lew Edwards, Richard Crenna, by having him photographed in action with a hooker at Medford's beach house. When Corelli finally tracks down the hooker who "The Gov" was partying with-Patrice Jacinto played by Angie Evenhart-she clams up and refuses to give him anything but her name and occupation. Slowly putting the pieces together Corelli soon realizes that there was a lot more going on then just simple blackmail! It's murder for both power and profit on the highest order. And possibly Even higher then the governor of the state of California himself! And it's Corelli, by sticking his nose into the matter, who's next on the killer or killer's hit list! The film "Jade" was so badly mishandled by its director William Friedkin that its screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tried to get his name off the movie's credits. As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising, after the far more superior "Kiss of Death", movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows. The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in "The French Connection". There was also a number of X-rated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green, Robin Thomas, who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him. ***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer, that Corelli illegally audio taped, for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.

    A wealthy art collector (and admirer of world leaders Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard M. Nixon) is murdered in his San Francisco mansion. Due to repeated chops with a hatchet, there is an abundance of blood. Along with many pricey artifacts, the dead man has an amply supply of sex paraphernalia. His most prized possession appears to be a collection of his partners' pubic hair. Four hours later, red-haired assistant district attorney David Caruso (as David Corelli) is at a dance attended by still sexy old flame Linda Fiorentino (as Anna Katrina "Trina" Maxwell). He still longs for her, but she married best friend Chazz Palminteri (as Matt Gavin), a rich defense lawyer. Employed to investigate, Mr. Caruso finds a cuff-link at the murder scene. Curiously, he decides to withhold it from other collected evidence... The cuff-link is from "The Golden Bay Club" where Caruso and Mr. Palminteri are members. Also discovered is the murder victim's collection of pornographic pictures. Most importantly, there are photographs of California Governor Richard Crenna (as Lew Edwards) with a young prostitute. Caruso confronts Mr. Crenna with the dirty pictures and is threateningly told he has a future in State politics comparable to Jerry Brown - a line they must regret, as Mr. Brown is presently serving an historic term as Governor. Everything seems to come together in an intriguing web of sex, mystery and murder. But, by the end, "Jade" proves looks can be deceiving. This is a puzzle with pieces shoved into place, by director William Friedkin. He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent. ***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna

Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

    This is a Basic Instict rehash plain and simple, actually it's a pre draft of basic instict. The directing is a mess, I can't believe this guy shot the french connection. But now he's old and where he tries to be different here, he is instead just plainly bad...Tight close ups for no reasons, boring set scenes, saturated photography...the cast is decent but with such a trite script...the dialog is worse than trivial. Its only saving grace is an unintended one, and maybe with that meditation in mind this can actually become a good film: Because the grotesqueness, blandness and stupidity in the realisation and script of this film reflects the world of powerless unsexual morons acting all powerful and sexual. Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I 've never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility. A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. It could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind.

    ***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and totally confusing thriller that has assistant D.A David Carelli, David Caruso, on the hunt for those who brutally sliced up and murdered a serial blackmailer who got way over his head in those he was blackmailing. Found cut to shreds in his mansion among his very expensive antiques, mostly from the Orient, Kyle Medford, Ron Ulsatd, sleazy and secret life as a master blackmailer hit the front pages of the local as well as national newspapers. It's Corelli who takes a very personal interest in Medford's murder only because his ex-girlfriend Trina Gavin, Linda Fiorentino,was one of the last persons to see him alive. This doesn't sit well with Trina's husband high powered defense attorney Matt Gavin, Chazz Palminteri,who feels that Corelli is using Medford's murder in making a play for his wife. Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast. It's there where Medford ran a prostitution ring, right out of his beach front house, that he used to attract very important people in the state to engage in. Getting the goods on the unsuspecting John's Medford would film them in action and use the photos and video tapes to blackmail them. The movies disjointed storyline has Corelli uncover a plot to blackmail the states top executive Governor Gov. Lew Edwards, Richard Crenna, by having him photographed in action with a hooker at Medford's beach house. When Corelli finally tracks down the hooker who "The Gov" was partying with-Patrice Jacinto played by Angie Evenhart-she clams up and refuses to give him anything but her name and occupation. Slowly putting the pieces together Corelli soon realizes that there was a lot more going on then just simple blackmail! It's murder for both power and profit on the highest order. And possibly Even higher then the governor of the state of California himself! And it's Corelli, by sticking his nose into the matter, who's next on the killer or killer's hit list! The film "Jade" was so badly mishandled by its director William Friedkin that its screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tried to get his name off the movie's credits. As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising, after the far more superior "Kiss of Death", movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows. The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in "The French Connection". There was also a number of X-rated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green, Robin Thomas, who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him. ***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer, that Corelli illegally audio taped, for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.

    A wealthy art collector (and admirer of world leaders Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard M. Nixon) is murdered in his San Francisco mansion. Due to repeated chops with a hatchet, there is an abundance of blood. Along with many pricey artifacts, the dead man has an amply supply of sex paraphernalia. His most prized possession appears to be a collection of his partners' pubic hair. Four hours later, red-haired assistant district attorney David Caruso (as David Corelli) is at a dance attended by still sexy old flame Linda Fiorentino (as Anna Katrina "Trina" Maxwell). He still longs for her, but she married best friend Chazz Palminteri (as Matt Gavin), a rich defense lawyer. Employed to investigate, Mr. Caruso finds a cuff-link at the murder scene. Curiously, he decides to withhold it from other collected evidence... The cuff-link is from "The Golden Bay Club" where Caruso and Mr. Palminteri are members. Also discovered is the murder victim's collection of pornographic pictures. Most importantly, there are photographs of California Governor Richard Crenna (as Lew Edwards) with a young prostitute. Caruso confronts Mr. Crenna with the dirty pictures and is threateningly told he has a future in State politics comparable to Jerry Brown - a line they must regret, as Mr. Brown is presently serving an historic term as Governor. Everything seems to come together in an intriguing web of sex, mystery and murder. But, by the end, "Jade" proves looks can be deceiving. This is a puzzle with pieces shoved into place, by director William Friedkin. He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent. ***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna

    Well, everybody probably knows how erotic suspenseful thrillers used to be in 90's, and this movie is no exception. As every movie with such specific subject, "Jade" begins with a main suspect of committing a murderer. In this kind of movie, sometimes he turns out to be the real killer, whilst in other times, it is someone we'd never expect. Trina had everything to be the murder out there; I strongly thought so when she said "ask that girl if I'm jade", since I believed she already knew that girl was dead and was playing fool. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have tension scenes to develop a remarkable movie, being too light most of the time. In the last scenes we have a distinct reference to 1980's "The Shining", whether William Friedkin admits it or not. It is, all in all, an entertaining film in every aspect, but never truly gives what you might wish for a suspenseful night.

    Although Jade has interesting stars and high production values, not to mention a famous director and a screenwriter who knew the terrain, its flaws are really quite basic  "Basic Instinct" in fact. It is hard to see "Jade" as anything other than a repackaging of "Basic Instinct" made two years before. Both have scripts by Joe Eszterhas  and it's much the same script. That is to say the basic formula is much the same. Both "Basic Instinct" and "Jade" feature women who have a dark side, which they can barely control. Much pseudo psychological claptrap is woven through both films. The telling difference is in the direction. Paul Veerhoven's "Basic Instinct" had a fluid style, which combined with a seductive Jerry Goldsmith score gave it surprising depth. Friedkin was less successful in disguising the thinness of the material. The movie begins with the murder of a well-known art collector, Kyle Medford. District attorney, David Corelli, played by David Caruso, is called to the crime scene. Kyle Medford has been hacked to death with an antique hatchet and crucified to a wall. "This is rage", says Corelli as he inspects the corpse. David Caruso incorporates a great deal of body language into his roles. In fact, he often contorts his posture to the point where he almost seems to be trying out for the part of Richard III. The mannerisms he brought to full flower as Horatio Caine in "CSI Miami", can be seen in the developmental stage in "Jade" including the loose stance with hands on the hips, the head slightly cocked or turned to the side indicating deep thought, and the Caruso specialty  the slow boil with his words delivered in measured tones as he struggles to control his emotions. As the story unfolds, it appears that Kyle Medford filmed prominent citizens in compromising situations and kept the pictures. Corelli discovers that these men, including the governor, all wanted a woman called Jade. As far as the governor is concerned, "Jade really rocked his world". Pictures found at Medford's beach house show Trina Gavin, played by Linda Fiorentino, having sex with a man. Trina Gavin is a leading clinical psychologist. In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men  she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri. Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in "The French Connection", tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in "Jade" but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets. After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed  although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's "Rites of Spring", and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness. The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

    Sleazy, lurid, and kinky. A murder mystery in the trashy tradition of paperbacks and post censorship Hollywood done with a glossy style and a bit of swagger that befits this type of thing. The confusing plot does not allow for too much intellectual intrigue but has enough of a thread to keep things moving from one set piece to another. The Director reaches into his briefcase of blue and sets off a series of sexually oriented, rather raunchy rants, counterpointed by some exciting, offbeat violence and chases. It is a bit too clever for its own good and the complexity is confrontational to the B-movie charm that is the best of this. Visually stunning in parts, but if you are prudish or turned-off by soft-core sex and uncomfortable discourse about intercourse, this may not be for you.

    Jade is the kind of cinema where the director who has some genuine talent and vision, if not consistently then strong when the iron hits, has to try and make something out of hackwork. Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all. Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing. So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable. Maybe I'll even revisit it at 3 in the morning on cable.

    When the assistant district attorney of San Francisco investigates the mysterious death of an important millionaire he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his who is married to an important lawyer. Now it is difficult for him to distinguish between what is reality and what should be reality.... Yes there are many similarities to this, Basic Instinct, and even Body of Evidence, but is that really a bad thing? This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat. Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film. There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men  she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri. Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in "The French Connection", tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in "Jade" but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets. After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed  although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's "Rites of Spring", and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness. The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

    Sleazy, lurid, and kinky. A murder mystery in the trashy tradition of paperbacks and post censorship Hollywood done with a glossy style and a bit of swagger that befits this type of thing. The confusing plot does not allow for too much intellectual intrigue but has enough of a thread to keep things moving from one set piece to another. The Director reaches into his briefcase of blue and sets off a series of sexually oriented, rather raunchy rants, counterpointed by some exciting, offbeat violence and chases. It is a bit too clever for its own good and the complexity is confrontational to the B-movie charm that is the best of this. Visually stunning in parts, but if you are prudish or turned-off by soft-core sex and uncomfortable discourse about intercourse, this may not be for you.

    Jade is the kind of cinema where the director who has some genuine talent and vision, if not consistently then strong when the iron hits, has to try and make something out of hackwork. Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all. Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing. So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey! What happens then in this story of backstabbing and murder and "deviant" sex and politics and so on, real pulpy - nay, just pot-boiler material - is that the simple style of it, how the direction is oddly elegant and experimental in some small ways, makes what is otherwise crap watchable. Maybe I'll even revisit it at 3 in the morning on cable.

    When the assistant district attorney of San Francisco investigates the mysterious death of an important millionaire he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his who is married to an important lawyer. Now it is difficult for him to distinguish between what is reality and what should be reality.... Yes there are many similarities to this, Basic Instinct, and even Body of Evidence, but is that really a bad thing? This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat. Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film. There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

    In the stock market most people buy long with the hope the price of their stock will go up. Others buy short, which is the opposite of long. Many of the reviews of this movie are long. I see this movie as short. A well acted poorly written/directed story. Several examples follow. One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

    Ignoring a plot line that is recycled, a climax that is a bit shaky with a twist that is strangely predictable, I'd say Jade could pass for an entertaining neo-noir. Starting with a delicious title sequence, the movie is stepped mostly in style. Something about it recalls Brian de Palma. Within the frame, it is staged quite theatrically, and it works. Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

    This is a Basic Instict rehash plain and simple, actually it's a pre draft of basic instict. The directing is a mess, I can't believe this guy shot the french connection. But now he's old and where he tries to be different here, he is instead just plainly bad...Tight close ups for no reasons, boring set scenes, saturated photography...the cast is decent but with such a trite script...the dialog is worse than trivial. Its only saving grace is an unintended one, and maybe with that meditation in mind this can actually become a good film: Because the grotesqueness, blandness and stupidity in the realisation and script of this film reflects the world of powerless unsexual morons acting all powerful and sexual. Obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy, erotic and smart. It tries to be a murder mystery, a who done it on coke a la BI, but it ends up being a who gives a ..., I 've never been so emotionally detached at the end of any mystery. But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility. A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level. It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence. It could even be quite a good sobering experience, even weirdly lyrical if one watches it with that in mind.

    ***SPOILERS*** Overly plotted and totally confusing thriller that has assistant D.A David Carelli, David Caruso, on the hunt for those who brutally sliced up and murdered a serial blackmailer who got way over his head in those he was blackmailing. Found cut to shreds in his mansion among his very expensive antiques, mostly from the Orient, Kyle Medford, Ron Ulsatd, sleazy and secret life as a master blackmailer hit the front pages of the local as well as national newspapers. It's Corelli who takes a very personal interest in Medford's murder only because his ex-girlfriend Trina Gavin, Linda Fiorentino,was one of the last persons to see him alive. This doesn't sit well with Trina's husband high powered defense attorney Matt Gavin, Chazz Palminteri,who feels that Corelli is using Medford's murder in making a play for his wife. Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast. It's there where Medford ran a prostitution ring, right out of his beach front house, that he used to attract very important people in the state to engage in. Getting the goods on the unsuspecting John's Medford would film them in action and use the photos and video tapes to blackmail them. The movies disjointed storyline has Corelli uncover a plot to blackmail the states top executive Governor Gov. Lew Edwards, Richard Crenna, by having him photographed in action with a hooker at Medford's beach house. When Corelli finally tracks down the hooker who "The Gov" was partying with-Patrice Jacinto played by Angie Evenhart-she clams up and refuses to give him anything but her name and occupation. Slowly putting the pieces together Corelli soon realizes that there was a lot more going on then just simple blackmail! It's murder for both power and profit on the highest order. And possibly Even higher then the governor of the state of California himself! And it's Corelli, by sticking his nose into the matter, who's next on the killer or killer's hit list! The film "Jade" was so badly mishandled by its director William Friedkin that its screenwriter Joe Eszterhas tried to get his name off the movie's credits. As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising, after the far more superior "Kiss of Death", movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows. The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in "The French Connection". There was also a number of X-rated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green, Robin Thomas, who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him. ***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer, that Corelli illegally audio taped, for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.
