    At least we all now know which film Gus van Sant watched over and over again prior to heading into production on his ill-disciplined 2005 film Last Days; itself a wondering, pondering piece about fumbling, mumbling characters (one of whom was perilously near to death) occupying a space which wasn't quite a jungle but carried with it an eerie humidity that didn't have it feel like a straight up forest. Like Aleksandr Sokurov's 1998 film Mother and Son, it even has an extended take of its character standing before a train track as a train rumbles past, said Russian picture a film I wanted to like more than I did, in that despite the overpowering atmosphere of dread; the distinct style its director applies to such an idea and the generally affecting content, it is quite remarkable how little Mother and Son actually amounts to. It is a frustrating film, straddling the line between feature and short, which still doesn't quite go down as well as you'd like but isn't entirely indigestible  you gnaw at it, searching for the flavour and the taste which has excited many others but eventually just end up with a bit of an ache and a sense of bafflement. The exploration of the ties of the titular mother and son begins with the opening shots and will continue on through to the last; both parties initially occupying a bedroom and laying down beside one another. They are Aleksei Ananishnov's character, simply named 'Son' and his similarly simplistically named 'Mother', payed by Gudrun Geyer. Given this first sighting of them, we sense they're close; the speaking over of one another in murmured tones about each of their respective dreams at once insinuating that this is perhaps how it is they sleep come the evenings since they may very well have just awoken; while the idea that either of them speak over one another dismisses what would commonly be highlighted as rude, instead suggesting a deeply rooted bond that sees them acknowledge one another through verbal confirmations that are played unorthodoxly. The film's bulk is a collection of sequences seeing them stick together through the thickest and the thinnest, the recognition of Mother's slowly decaying health and Son's acknowledgement that he will be here for its now seemingly short duration. Where it is they are both based for the duration of the film is at Mother's residence; a small, wooded house which has been overtaken by the greenery around it. She is a woman whom possesses very little; a shed not so far away housing a few other items the only other structure in the area. They occupy a world which looks as if it has just fallen out of a nuclear war; the skies constantly greyed out by rolling clouds, vast fields of grass and pastures of nothingness playing host to the majority of what's on the ground as rumbles of thunder plague the above. Mother's home even looks as if it has taken the odd shelling, its worn and decrepit state seemingly uninhabitable and yet they stay on, leading one to wonder if it is one of very few structures left. Sokurov even goes to further lengths to disorientate the audience by capturing the majority of the compositions of the surrounding area through an array of lens' not always fit for the crispest of focus. Most of the film will consist of the pair of them speaking to one another on issues of a highly philosophical and rather theological nature, jarring given the spaced out timbre of both the piece and their mannerisms; the item which sticks out the most is just how little the majority of it seems to refer or indeed contribute to anything else. He must provide her with medicine and for the most part of the film, must carry her around as they journey from place to place, all the while speaking in hushed and mournful bleats. Most of Mother and Son is indeed surface, but what a surface packed full of drained cinematography; the acknowledgement from two lonely parties that an immense bond of many-a decade is on the verge of ending and a really downcast, incoming doom-laden sensation as everything appears to play out in a post-apocalyptic world; a mythical backdrop somewhat unnecessarily destroyed by the odd background shot of the rest of civilisation operating. I read it is a part of an ongoing trilogy, the sorts of trilogies filmmakers rather than studios produce; proper trilogies, that are linked by thematics and undercurrents rather than continuations of slight stories and protagonist misadventures. Oddly, and admittedly in hindsight, the film appears to have more in common with a recent 2008 Sokurov effort entitled Aleksandra. Said film was about a bond between a young man and an elderly female relative whom appears worn and withered by life, but where Aleksandra followed a woman whom had travelled to meet with her grandson whose job might see him precariously close to death on occasion, the premise here is reversed: Ananishnov's character the outsider travelling to his mother's rural and cut-off place of dwelling to spend time with her as she nears her respective 'time'. Aleksandra eventually had both characters come to inhabit a locale in which instruments of warfare such as tanks and rifles were lined up in rows of a dozen-or-so, but made to look quite beautiful or poetic by way of composition despite their purpose - in Mother and Son, extended shots of items more commonly associated with the peaceful or tranquil are given an uncanny edge in the form of expansive fields and woodland rendered quite unnerving through cinematography and such. There just seems to be a core idea here that Sokurov has left out; there is very little meat on the bone which inexplicably in turn, leads to a gristly experience; something which is easy to admire but difficult to recommend nor get overly excited about.

    Russian screenwriter and director Alexandr Sokurov started his career by making several documentaries and made his feature film debut in 1987 with "The Lonely Human Voice" which he dedicated to his friend Andrei Tarkovsky. "Mother and Son" became his international breakthrough, and in 2002 he directed "Russian Ark" which was the first film in the history of cinema that was shot in one singular take. In 1999 he began a biographical trilogy about three of the 19th century's most powerful political leaders with "Molokh", which was succeeded by "Telets" (2001) and "The Sun" (2005). These three films regarded Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Lenin and Japanese emperor Hirohito. This Russian-German co-production which was produced by German producer Thomas Kufus, was screened in the Panorama section at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, in the Masters section at the 22nd Toronto International Film Festival in 1997 and is the eight feature film by one of the most innovating and experimental filmmakers through time. It tells the story about a son and his mother who is suffering from a failing heart. The son adores his mother and is dependent on her. They are located at an unknown place on a long and hot day which is surrounded by wide landscapes, and in what seems to be an attempt to bring his mother to someone who can help her, the son carries her in his arms through a long road leading towards an unknown destination. This remarkable movie experience is told with a cogent narrative structure, minimal dialog and filmed with long takes. The time, the place and the characters are nameless, and it may seem as the two main characters are the only people existing in this film's universe. The unusually quiet pace creates a feeling of watching the film in slow-motion, and this feeling becomes hypnotic when one sees the lingering cinematography which is incomparable. The vitality of nature contrasts the grieving characters, the actors versatile and emotional expressions are performed with great realism by Aleksei Ananishnov and Gudrun Geyer, in their debut feature film roles, and their internal acting performances are captivating. Alexandr Sokurov examines themes such as grief, longing, maternal love, redemption, loneliness, loss, time and faith. Considering the poetic aura that the camera movements and the cinematography radiates, this film can be perceived as an allegorical poem. Due to it's subtle pace, nostalgic atmosphere and unique film language, this contemplative film can be quite a challenge. The story demands that the viewers completes the story and thereby forms their own individual interpretation. I've rarely seen a film with so little use of dialog manage to create such strong emotions. The sight of the two inseparable human beings who little by little are torn apart and in their grief appears as naked souls, is an unforgettable and moving experience. By only focusing on the truest expressions of human beings and nature's colorfulness, force and symbolism, Alexandr Sokurov manages to convey that there is nothing more important in this life than the people we love. Moments of affectionate caresses, endless silence and nostalgia is distinctly filmed by Alexandr Sokurov who creates diverse perspectives in this reflective, lyrical and picturesque masterpiece which gained, among several other awards, the Special Silver St.George Award at the 34th Moscow International Film Festival in 1997.

    This movie was tragically bad. Why anyone would compare this mess to the works of Tarkovsky or Terrence Malick is completely baffling to me and probably will be to you, too. I loved Russian Ark, but this was simply a poorly made student film with no passion, no zeal, and no interesting qualities whatsoever. Some of the silent and slow moments were rather meditative, but I would've much rather have seen this as a short film. The story was dull and trite, and frankly I didn't appreciate the message or idea at all. A mother who loved her son that much should let him go into the world and be his own man. That's the definition of true love, not keeping him around to wilt along with she. And if the young man loved his mother, he would "let her go" rather than allow her to suffer and strain in such pain. Maybe it's a philosophy conflict between myself and this director, but I did not see this movie as a love poem, but rather an example of true selfishness on the part of both characters. And the cinematography. Oy vey! This is where I was most confused, as already suggested. When I saw the box for the DVD, I was already a bit surprised to see the description of the film (which concentrated almost solely on how beautiful the movie looked). From the pictures, it looked like a made-for-TV movie in some backwater E. European town... ... and indeed, when I put the movie on, that's exactly what it looked like. Such splendid landscapes, to be sure, but sullied completely by ridiculous filters that distorted each view and that put a faded greenish brown tincture to everything. This did not represent a dream or a hallucination or the "act of decay" for me. It just looked bad. Really bad. And even beyond the silly, obfuscating filters and the like, the compositions were horrendous. There was no semblance of aesthetic responsibility in the creation of the shots. Looked like they just randomly set the actors in various places and blindly left the camera wherever it would stand. If Lars von Trier were to try yet again to make "the crappiest film ever" as he tends to joke about doing, he couldn't make something that looked this awful. For people to excuse the terrible narrative concept for the cinematography is just strange. Perhaps I need to see it on the big screen? Thank goodness this one is so short. Ugh. Avoid at all costs!

    It's so visually stimulating that it transcends reality. Sokurov subverts cinema by concentrating on each individual frame, as if we were watching a 24 frames by second succession of impeccable paintings in a hypnotic pinachoteca. It's like being in an art gallery where the paintings  and not the viewers  move. The Russian director skilfully exposes the grey and vacuous existence of an ailing mother and her doting son against the backdrop of verdant Russian summer. Death is overwhelming and yet comforting. The grainy images are dainty and delicate, as in the ephemerality of life. The dialogue is minimal. Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm. Mutter and Soh is beyond cinema: near-static images that speak for themselves, feeble lives that unravel into infinity, like grainy water-based paintings which quickly wear out.

    If this is not essentialist, utopian film-making, then it is at best simply implausible. Whilst its fundamental lack of content allows the viewer to substitute in their own fantasies and views  neither of which the film precludes  when stripped of these, what you have is 'blank canvas' film-making at its most obvious. If Sokurov wished to make a piece on rural Russia in a cinematically unique visual language, he needn't have gone to the trouble of hiring these two actors to flesh out such landscapes. As it is, the characters are actually distracting: Mother is an irksome shell of nothing, Son borders on the autistic; without a conscious engagement with reality, all we're left with is the tenuous would-be bond between the two, which can be read as perverse as it can natural.

    Director Alexander Sokurov turns life into art, and back again. He has control I haven't seen exercised so relentlessly over actors since Carl Dreyer was alive. Will it move you? I'm not sure. But you will marvel at a film so far out of our time. The story is about a young man and his dying mother who spend their remaining days together in a house in a forest close to the coast. Mother And Son is an amazingly delicate, barely hour-long evocation of final words and last gasps, full of sequences  ravishing landscapes, death bed pietas  that strive for the quality of portraiture; remarkable as it is, it belongs to that school of cinema that wants to be something else entirely, an aspiration that will strike some viewers as either admirable or antithetical. Alexei Fyodorov's cinematography is incredible, and combined with Vladimir Persov and Martin Steyer's impeccable sound design creates a visual and aural landscape of the soul that is unforgettable.

    This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia, as she lays dying. I am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "Mat I Syn" is cruel reality. On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves really too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" among them as a total bore. I guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. I surely see the beauty of it, but maybe I am not in the right state of mind.

    This film is exquisite: it was like looking through the lens of Constable or Turner. The world is seen in a new way and the action takes place within it.I have read critical views on "painterly" films but I don't agree with them. Cinema is a visual experience , essentially and the plot etc. is a given. Russian films do express a strange dark beauty and there are lines in the film worthy of any great Russian writers: The Father's love crucifies the Son , and the Son allows himself to be crucified from "Father and Son" the same director, Sukarov.Another example of brilliant Russian cinema!The mother son relationship is almost brutally fragile but the devotion of the son, carrying his mother into the landscape provided the focus. Brilliant

    The first impression one has upon viewing Sokurov's film is of formal aesthetic parallels with Tarkovsky's cinematography (long takes, his free use of natural sounds, and the unaffectedness of his actors). Both directors concern themselves with philosophical questions of the human existence and strive to express the inner reality of their beings. However, whereas Tarkovsky' main characters are spiritually oppressed, struggling to overcome and escape their fates, Sokurov's characters films are resigned to and accepting of their oppression. Tarkovsky's cinema is one of striving toward spiritual liberation, whereas Sukorov's cinema is one of enduring spiritual submission. In "Mother and Son," one is struck above all by the rather unusual cinematography, starting with the very first images following the credits. Many scenes have the flatness of a painting instead of the usual three-dimensionality of films. Indeed, "Mother and Son" is a "picture-film," where the images, the perspectives are routinely distorted and flattened to two dimensions. Sokurov's intentions are clear so far has he is striving to give his film the appearance of an icon or of a religious painting of the Quattro cento. I would also add that some of the indoor scenes, in particular the opening one, reminds one of the founder of the German expressionist school, Edvard Munch. The distortion of the characters' physiques and the claustrophobic atmosphere of the room reeking of death also contribute to this identification with Munch's most famous paintings and engravings. All through this production, Sokurov distorts his images in various ways, using panes of glass placed in front or to the side of the lens, mirrors, and even paint on the camera lens itself. Through these effects, the characters, objects, and nature appear "compressed" and distorted, which then serves as a metaphor for the turmoil of the soul. This turmoil is exacerbated further by the sense of a timelessness which permeates the film. Time seems suspended by the stillness of the characters. The long takes (there are fifty-eight shots in a film which runs for seventy-three minutes) also give a sense of stillness, which make us lose all sense of time. "Mother and Son" is almost a silent film. The silence which prevails for most of the film is deepened by discrete, natural sounds emanating from beyond the screen, accentuating the sense of isolation from the rest of the world: running water, thunder, wind, bird calls, etc. In this respect, Nature is an important character, visually as well as aurally. The appearance of a steaming train or of a sailboat far in the distance only serves to remind us of the isolation of these two characters. These natural sounds are mixed together with some very subtle original music by Mikhail Ivanovich, together with a few musical segments from Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio. The dialogue is spare, and these exchanges can hardly be considered conversation. The characters have gone beyond talking to express their thoughts and inner feelings to each other: they even have the same dreams. No philosophical discussions on the meaning of love or death ever arrive to reinforce what is evident through the imagery. Finally, one will notice that the two actors are non-professional: Alexei Ananishnov is "in real life" a mathematics professor, and it is the only film ever made by Gudrun Geyer, who had no previous acting experience. The characters in the film are present, but they are not acting. This is in keeping with Sokurov intentions to relate an experience and not a story. "Mother and Son"'s themes are about one of the deepest relationships which can exist on the Earth, the love between a mother and her son, and the solitude of the death experience. The film explores the remaining moments between the son and his mother on her unavoidable journey toward death. Nothing else exists for these two characters, about whom we know nothing. Sokurov does not reveal anything about their past, nor about their future. The present moment on their road together toward the doors of death is the only subject of importance. They are as one being in a strange, lonely, but beautiful world. But this intimate relationship will soon be rent asunder by Death, and Sokurov shows us that in spite of their close love relationship, in the end death is still a personal, private, isolating experience for both of them. As the mother drifts in and out of consciousness, the son's attitude as he faces the inescapable end goes from somewhat cheery and reassuring in front of his conscious mother, to total anguish and desperation when he is alone in the woods. If the journey of these characters is a mystical experience, it is not a religious one. God is never mentioned nor alluded to. Sokurov denies a deity, but not some indeterminate afterlife. The film's ending is still ambiguous, as Sokurov leaves open the possibility that the mother is still alive when the son returns from his walk. In the scene just before the son leaves the house, his mother lies in her bed-coffin, a white butterfly rests on her fingers. In many cultures, from the Christian Irish to the Baluba from central Zaire, the soul of a person emerges from the cocoon (the grave) and flies away in the form of a butterfly. Sokurov leaves us guessing at the end of the film: on the mother's gray, emaciated hand, the butterfly is still there. "Mother and Son" is an experience much more than it is a film. We are confronted with a continuum of painted scenes, as we would in any museum. We are drawn into each scene as we would be drawn into each painting, reflecting on content which raises in us a myriad of emotions -- some from long ago, forgotten -- or provokes new reflection. All of these emotions appear and disappear in dream-like fashion and in so doing, we partake in the mystery and complexity of the love between a mother and her son.

    The film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their living in very poor conditions. It shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). But what do we see further? After their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. It is not possible. A person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. He would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. Another thing. The author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see he learned many Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. Someone has compared this film with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.

"Mother and Son" became his international breakthrough, and in 2002 he directed "Russian Ark" which was the first film in the history of cinema that was shot in one singular take. In 1999 he began a biographical trilogy about three of the 19th century's most powerful political leaders with "Molokh", which was succeeded by "Telets" (2001) and "The Sun" (2005). These three films regarded Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Lenin and Japanese emperor Hirohito. This Russian-German co-production which was produced by German producer Thomas Kufus, was screened in the Panorama section at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, in the Masters section at the 22nd Toronto International Film Festival in 1997 and is the eight feature film by one of the most innovating and experimental filmmakers through time. It tells the story about a son and his mother who is suffering from a failing heart. The son adores his mother and is dependent on her. They are located at an unknown place on a long and hot day which is surrounded by wide landscapes, and in what seems to be an attempt to bring his mother to someone who can help her, the son carries her in his arms through a long road leading towards an unknown destination. This remarkable movie experience is told with a cogent narrative structure, minimal dialog and filmed with long takes. The time, the place and the characters are nameless, and it may seem as the two main characters are the only people existing in this film's universe. The unusually quiet pace creates a feeling of watching the film in slow-motion, and this feeling becomes hypnotic when one sees the lingering cinematography which is incomparable. The vitality of nature contrasts the grieving characters, the actors versatile and emotional expressions are performed with great realism by Aleksei Ananishnov and Gudrun Geyer, in their debut feature film roles, and their internal acting performances are captivating. Alexandr Sokurov examines themes such as grief, longing, maternal love, redemption, loneliness, loss, time and faith. Considering the poetic aura that the camera movements and the cinematography radiates, this film can be perceived as an allegorical poem. Due to it's subtle pace, nostalgic atmosphere and unique film language, this contemplative film can be quite a challenge. The story demands that the viewers completes the story and thereby forms their own individual interpretation. I've rarely seen a film with so little use of dialog manage to create such strong emotions. The sight of the two inseparable human beings who little by little are torn apart and in their grief appears as naked souls, is an unforgettable and moving experience. By only focusing on the truest expressions of human beings and nature's colorfulness, force and symbolism, Alexandr Sokurov manages to convey that there is nothing more important in this life than the people we love. Moments of affectionate caresses, endless silence and nostalgia is distinctly filmed by Alexandr Sokurov who creates diverse perspectives in this reflective, lyrical and picturesque masterpiece which gained, among several other awards, the Special Silver St.George Award at the 34th Moscow International Film Festival in 1997.

    This movie was tragically bad. Why anyone would compare this mess to the works of Tarkovsky or Terrence Malick is completely baffling to me and probably will be to you, too. I loved Russian Ark, but this was simply a poorly made student film with no passion, no zeal, and no interesting qualities whatsoever. Some of the silent and slow moments were rather meditative, but I would've much rather have seen this as a short film. The story was dull and trite, and frankly I didn't appreciate the message or idea at all. A mother who loved her son that much should let him go into the world and be his own man. That's the definition of true love, not keeping him around to wilt along with she. And if the young man loved his mother, he would "let her go" rather than allow her to suffer and strain in such pain. Maybe it's a philosophy conflict between myself and this director, but I did not see this movie as a love poem, but rather an example of true selfishness on the part of both characters. And the cinematography. Oy vey! This is where I was most confused, as already suggested. When I saw the box for the DVD, I was already a bit surprised to see the description of the film (which concentrated almost solely on how beautiful the movie looked). From the pictures, it looked like a made-for-TV movie in some backwater E. European town... ... and indeed, when I put the movie on, that's exactly what it looked like. Such splendid landscapes, to be sure, but sullied completely by ridiculous filters that distorted each view and that put a faded greenish brown tincture to everything. This did not represent a dream or a hallucination or the "act of decay" for me. It just looked bad. Really bad. And even beyond the silly, obfuscating filters and the like, the compositions were horrendous. There was no semblance of aesthetic responsibility in the creation of the shots. Looked like they just randomly set the actors in various places and blindly left the camera wherever it would stand. If Lars von Trier were to try yet again to make "the crappiest film ever" as he tends to joke about doing, he couldn't make something that looked this awful. For people to excuse the terrible narrative concept for the cinematography is just strange. Perhaps I need to see it on the big screen? Thank goodness this one is so short. Ugh. Avoid at all costs!

    It's so visually stimulating that it transcends reality. Sokurov subverts cinema by concentrating on each individual frame, as if we were watching a 24 frames by second succession of impeccable paintings in a hypnotic pinachoteca. It's like being in an art gallery where the paintings  and not the viewers  move. The Russian director skilfully exposes the grey and vacuous existence of an ailing mother and her doting son against the backdrop of verdant Russian summer. Death is overwhelming and yet comforting. The grainy images are dainty and delicate, as in the ephemerality of life. The dialogue is minimal. Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm. Mutter and Soh is beyond cinema: near-static images that speak for themselves, feeble lives that unravel into infinity, like grainy water-based paintings which quickly wear out.

    If this is not essentialist, utopian film-making, then it is at best simply implausible. Whilst its fundamental lack of content allows the viewer to substitute in their own fantasies and views  neither of which the film precludes  when stripped of these, what you have is 'blank canvas' film-making at its most obvious. If Sokurov wished to make a piece on rural Russia in a cinematically unique visual language, he needn't have gone to the trouble of hiring these two actors to flesh out such landscapes. As it is, the characters are actually distracting: Mother is an irksome shell of nothing, Son borders on the autistic; without a conscious engagement with reality, all we're left with is the tenuous would-be bond between the two, which can be read as perverse as it can natural.

    Director Alexander Sokurov turns life into art, and back again. He has control I haven't seen exercised so relentlessly over actors since Carl Dreyer was alive. Will it move you? I'm not sure. But you will marvel at a film so far out of our time. The story is about a young man and his dying mother who spend their remaining days together in a house in a forest close to the coast. Mother And Son is an amazingly delicate, barely hour-long evocation of final words and last gasps, full of sequences  ravishing landscapes, death bed pietas  that strive for the quality of portraiture; remarkable as it is, it belongs to that school of cinema that wants to be something else entirely, an aspiration that will strike some viewers as either admirable or antithetical. Alexei Fyodorov's cinematography is incredible, and combined with Vladimir Persov and Martin Steyer's impeccable sound design creates a visual and aural landscape of the soul that is unforgettable.

    This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia, as she lays dying. I am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "Mat I Syn" is cruel reality. On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves really too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" among them as a total bore. I guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. I surely see the beauty of it, but maybe I am not in the right state of mind.

    This film is exquisite: it was like looking through the lens of Constable or Turner. The world is seen in a new way and the action takes place within it.I have read critical views on "painterly" films but I don't agree with them. Cinema is a visual experience , essentially and the plot etc. is a given. Russian films do express a strange dark beauty and there are lines in the film worthy of any great Russian writers: The Father's love crucifies the Son , and the Son allows himself to be crucified from "Father and Son" the same director, Sukarov.Another example of brilliant Russian cinema!The mother son relationship is almost brutally fragile but the devotion of the son, carrying his mother into the landscape provided the focus. Brilliant

    The first impression one has upon viewing Sokurov's film is of formal aesthetic parallels with Tarkovsky's cinematography (long takes, his free use of natural sounds, and the unaffectedness of his actors). Both directors concern themselves with philosophical questions of the human existence and strive to express the inner reality of their beings. However, whereas Tarkovsky' main characters are spiritually oppressed, struggling to overcome and escape their fates, Sokurov's characters films are resigned to and accepting of their oppression. Tarkovsky's cinema is one of striving toward spiritual liberation, whereas Sukorov's cinema is one of enduring spiritual submission. In "Mother and Son," one is struck above all by the rather unusual cinematography, starting with the very first images following the credits. Many scenes have the flatness of a painting instead of the usual three-dimensionality of films. Indeed, "Mother and Son" is a "picture-film," where the images, the perspectives are routinely distorted and flattened to two dimensions. Sokurov's intentions are clear so far has he is striving to give his film the appearance of an icon or of a religious painting of the Quattro cento. I would also add that some of the indoor scenes, in particular the opening one, reminds one of the founder of the German expressionist school, Edvard Munch. The distortion of the characters' physiques and the claustrophobic atmosphere of the room reeking of death also contribute to this identification with Munch's most famous paintings and engravings. All through this production, Sokurov distorts his images in various ways, using panes of glass placed in front or to the side of the lens, mirrors, and even paint on the camera lens itself. Through these effects, the characters, objects, and nature appear "compressed" and distorted, which then serves as a metaphor for the turmoil of the soul. This turmoil is exacerbated further by the sense of a timelessness which permeates the film. Time seems suspended by the stillness of the characters. The long takes (there are fifty-eight shots in a film which runs for seventy-three minutes) also give a sense of stillness, which make us lose all sense of time. "Mother and Son" is almost a silent film. The silence which prevails for most of the film is deepened by discrete, natural sounds emanating from beyond the screen, accentuating the sense of isolation from the rest of the world: running water, thunder, wind, bird calls, etc. In this respect, Nature is an important character, visually as well as aurally. The appearance of a steaming train or of a sailboat far in the distance only serves to remind us of the isolation of these two characters. These natural sounds are mixed together with some very subtle original music by Mikhail Ivanovich, together with a few musical segments from Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio. The dialogue is spare, and these exchanges can hardly be considered conversation. The characters have gone beyond talking to express their thoughts and inner feelings to each other: they even have the same dreams. No philosophical discussions on the meaning of love or death ever arrive to reinforce what is evident through the imagery. Finally, one will notice that the two actors are non-professional: Alexei Ananishnov is "in real life" a mathematics professor, and it is the only film ever made by Gudrun Geyer, who had no previous acting experience. The characters in the film are present, but they are not acting. This is in keeping with Sokurov intentions to relate an experience and not a story. "Mother and Son"'s themes are about one of the deepest relationships which can exist on the Earth, the love between a mother and her son, and the solitude of the death experience. The film explores the remaining moments between the son and his mother on her unavoidable journey toward death. Nothing else exists for these two characters, about whom we know nothing. Sokurov does not reveal anything about their past, nor about their future. The present moment on their road together toward the doors of death is the only subject of importance. They are as one being in a strange, lonely, but beautiful world. But this intimate relationship will soon be rent asunder by Death, and Sokurov shows us that in spite of their close love relationship, in the end death is still a personal, private, isolating experience for both of them. As the mother drifts in and out of consciousness, the son's attitude as he faces the inescapable end goes from somewhat cheery and reassuring in front of his conscious mother, to total anguish and desperation when he is alone in the woods. If the journey of these characters is a mystical experience, it is not a religious one. God is never mentioned nor alluded to. Sokurov denies a deity, but not some indeterminate afterlife. The film's ending is still ambiguous, as Sokurov leaves open the possibility that the mother is still alive when the son returns from his walk. In the scene just before the son leaves the house, his mother lies in her bed-coffin, a white butterfly rests on her fingers. In many cultures, from the Christian Irish to the Baluba from central Zaire, the soul of a person emerges from the cocoon (the grave) and flies away in the form of a butterfly. Sokurov leaves us guessing at the end of the film: on the mother's gray, emaciated hand, the butterfly is still there. "Mother and Son" is an experience much more than it is a film. We are confronted with a continuum of painted scenes, as we would in any museum. We are drawn into each scene as we would be drawn into each painting, reflecting on content which raises in us a myriad of emotions -- some from long ago, forgotten -- or provokes new reflection. All of these emotions appear and disappear in dream-like fashion and in so doing, we partake in the mystery and complexity of the love between a mother and her son.

    The film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their living in very poor conditions. It shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). But what do we see further? After their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. It is not possible. A person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. He would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. Another thing. The author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see he learned many Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. Someone has compared this film with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.

    At least we all now know which film Gus van Sant watched over and over again prior to heading into production on his ill-disciplined 2005 film Last Days; itself a wondering, pondering piece about fumbling, mumbling characters (one of whom was perilously near to death) occupying a space which wasn't quite a jungle but carried with it an eerie humidity that didn't have it feel like a straight up forest. Like Aleksandr Sokurov's 1998 film Mother and Son, it even has an extended take of its character standing before a train track as a train rumbles past, said Russian picture a film I wanted to like more than I did, in that despite the overpowering atmosphere of dread; the distinct style its director applies to such an idea and the generally affecting content, it is quite remarkable how little Mother and Son actually amounts to. It is a frustrating film, straddling the line between feature and short, which still doesn't quite go down as well as you'd like but isn't entirely indigestible  you gnaw at it, searching for the flavour and the taste which has excited many others but eventually just end up with a bit of an ache and a sense of bafflement. The exploration of the ties of the titular mother and son begins with the opening shots and will continue on through to the last; both parties initially occupying a bedroom and laying down beside one another. They are Aleksei Ananishnov's character, simply named 'Son' and his similarly simplistically named 'Mother', payed by Gudrun Geyer. Given this first sighting of them, we sense they're close; the speaking over of one another in murmured tones about each of their respective dreams at once insinuating that this is perhaps how it is they sleep come the evenings since they may very well have just awoken; while the idea that either of them speak over one another dismisses what would commonly be highlighted as rude, instead suggesting a deeply rooted bond that sees them acknowledge one another through verbal confirmations that are played unorthodoxly. The film's bulk is a collection of sequences seeing them stick together through the thickest and the thinnest, the recognition of Mother's slowly decaying health and Son's acknowledgement that he will be here for its now seemingly short duration. Where it is they are both based for the duration of the film is at Mother's residence; a small, wooded house which has been overtaken by the greenery around it. She is a woman whom possesses very little; a shed not so far away housing a few other items the only other structure in the area. They occupy a world which looks as if it has just fallen out of a nuclear war; the skies constantly greyed out by rolling clouds, vast fields of grass and pastures of nothingness playing host to the majority of what's on the ground as rumbles of thunder plague the above. Mother's home even looks as if it has taken the odd shelling, its worn and decrepit state seemingly uninhabitable and yet they stay on, leading one to wonder if it is one of very few structures left. Sokurov even goes to further lengths to disorientate the audience by capturing the majority of the compositions of the surrounding area through an array of lens' not always fit for the crispest of focus. Most of the film will consist of the pair of them speaking to one another on issues of a highly philosophical and rather theological nature, jarring given the spaced out timbre of both the piece and their mannerisms; the item which sticks out the most is just how little the majority of it seems to refer or indeed contribute to anything else. He must provide her with medicine and for the most part of the film, must carry her around as they journey from place to place, all the while speaking in hushed and mournful bleats. Most of Mother and Son is indeed surface, but what a surface packed full of drained cinematography; the acknowledgement from two lonely parties that an immense bond of many-a decade is on the verge of ending and a really downcast, incoming doom-laden sensation as everything appears to play out in a post-apocalyptic world; a mythical backdrop somewhat unnecessarily destroyed by the odd background shot of the rest of civilisation operating. I read it is a part of an ongoing trilogy, the sorts of trilogies filmmakers rather than studios produce; proper trilogies, that are linked by thematics and undercurrents rather than continuations of slight stories and protagonist misadventures. Oddly, and admittedly in hindsight, the film appears to have more in common with a recent 2008 Sokurov effort entitled Aleksandra. Said film was about a bond between a young man and an elderly female relative whom appears worn and withered by life, but where Aleksandra followed a woman whom had travelled to meet with her grandson whose job might see him precariously close to death on occasion, the premise here is reversed: Ananishnov's character the outsider travelling to his mother's rural and cut-off place of dwelling to spend time with her as she nears her respective 'time'. Aleksandra eventually had both characters come to inhabit a locale in which instruments of warfare such as tanks and rifles were lined up in rows of a dozen-or-so, but made to look quite beautiful or poetic by way of composition despite their purpose - in Mother and Son, extended shots of items more commonly associated with the peaceful or tranquil are given an uncanny edge in the form of expansive fields and woodland rendered quite unnerving through cinematography and such. There just seems to be a core idea here that Sokurov has left out; there is very little meat on the bone which inexplicably in turn, leads to a gristly experience; something which is easy to admire but difficult to recommend nor get overly excited about.

    Mother And Son is quite literally a film unlike any other. Indeed, it may be more accurate to describe it as a cinematic experience rather than a film.

    Director Alexander Sokurov turns life into art, and back again. He has control I haven't seen exercised so relentlessly over actors since Carl Dreyer was alive. Will it move you? I'm not sure. But you will marvel at a film so far out of our time. The story is about a young man and his dying mother who spend their remaining days together in a house in a forest close to the coast. Mother And Son is an amazingly delicate, barely hour-long evocation of final words and last gasps, full of sequences  ravishing landscapes, death bed pietas  that strive for the quality of portraiture; remarkable as it is, it belongs to that school of cinema that wants to be something else entirely, an aspiration that will strike some viewers as either admirable or antithetical. Alexei Fyodorov's cinematography is incredible, and combined with Vladimir Persov and Martin Steyer's impeccable sound design creates a visual and aural landscape of the soul that is unforgettable.

    This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia, as she lays dying. I am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "Mat I Syn" is cruel reality. On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves really too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" among them as a total bore. I guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. I surely see the beauty of it, but maybe I am not in the right state of mind.

    This film is exquisite: it was like looking through the lens of Constable or Turner. The world is seen in a new way and the action takes place within it.I have read critical views on "painterly" films but I don't agree with them. Cinema is a visual experience , essentially and the plot etc. is a given. Russian films do express a strange dark beauty and there are lines in the film worthy of any great Russian writers: The Father's love crucifies the Son , and the Son allows himself to be crucified from "Father and Son" the same director, Sukarov.Another example of brilliant Russian cinema!The mother son relationship is almost brutally fragile but the devotion of the son, carrying his mother into the landscape provided the focus. Brilliant

    The first impression one has upon viewing Sokurov's film is of formal aesthetic parallels with Tarkovsky's cinematography (long takes, his free use of natural sounds, and the unaffectedness of his actors). Both directors concern themselves with philosophical questions of the human existence and strive to express the inner reality of their beings. However, whereas Tarkovsky' main characters are spiritually oppressed, struggling to overcome and escape their fates, Sokurov's characters films are resigned to and accepting of their oppression. Tarkovsky's cinema is one of striving toward spiritual liberation, whereas Sukorov's cinema is one of enduring spiritual submission. In "Mother and Son," one is struck above all by the rather unusual cinematography, starting with the very first images following the credits. Many scenes have the flatness of a painting instead of the usual three-dimensionality of films. Indeed, "Mother and Son" is a "picture-film," where the images, the perspectives are routinely distorted and flattened to two dimensions. Sokurov's intentions are clear so far has he is striving to give his film the appearance of an icon or of a religious painting of the Quattro cento. I would also add that some of the indoor scenes, in particular the opening one, reminds one of the founder of the German expressionist school, Edvard Munch. The distortion of the characters' physiques and the claustrophobic atmosphere of the room reeking of death also contribute to this identification with Munch's most famous paintings and engravings. All through this production, Sokurov distorts his images in various ways, using panes of glass placed in front or to the side of the lens, mirrors, and even paint on the camera lens itself. Through these effects, the characters, objects, and nature appear "compressed" and distorted, which then serves as a metaphor for the turmoil of the soul. This turmoil is exacerbated further by the sense of a timelessness which permeates the film. Time seems suspended by the stillness of the characters. The long takes (there are fifty-eight shots in a film which runs for seventy-three minutes) also give a sense of stillness, which make us lose all sense of time. "Mother and Son" is almost a silent film. The silence which prevails for most of the film is deepened by discrete, natural sounds emanating from beyond the screen, accentuating the sense of isolation from the rest of the world: running water, thunder, wind, bird calls, etc. In this respect, Nature is an important character, visually as well as aurally. The appearance of a steaming train or of a sailboat far in the distance only serves to remind us of the isolation of these two characters. These natural sounds are mixed together with some very subtle original music by Mikhail Ivanovich, together with a few musical segments from Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio. The dialogue is spare, and these exchanges can hardly be considered conversation. The characters have gone beyond talking to express their thoughts and inner feelings to each other: they even have the same dreams. No philosophical discussions on the meaning of love or death ever arrive to reinforce what is evident through the imagery. Finally, one will notice that the two actors are non-professional: Alexei Ananishnov is "in real life" a mathematics professor, and it is the only film ever made by Gudrun Geyer, who had no previous acting experience. The characters in the film are present, but they are not acting. This is in keeping with Sokurov intentions to relate an experience and not a story. "Mother and Son"'s themes are about one of the deepest relationships which can exist on the Earth, the love between a mother and her son, and the solitude of the death experience. The film explores the remaining moments between the son and his mother on her unavoidable journey toward death. Nothing else exists for these two characters, about whom we know nothing. Sokurov does not reveal anything about their past, nor about their future. The present moment on their road together toward the doors of death is the only subject of importance. They are as one being in a strange, lonely, but beautiful world. But this intimate relationship will soon be rent asunder by Death, and Sokurov shows us that in spite of their close love relationship, in the end death is still a personal, private, isolating experience for both of them. As the mother drifts in and out of consciousness, the son's attitude as he faces the inescapable end goes from somewhat cheery and reassuring in front of his conscious mother, to total anguish and desperation when he is alone in the woods. If the journey of these characters is a mystical experience, it is not a religious one. God is never mentioned nor alluded to. Sokurov denies a deity, but not some indeterminate afterlife. The film's ending is still ambiguous, as Sokurov leaves open the possibility that the mother is still alive when the son returns from his walk. In the scene just before the son leaves the house, his mother lies in her bed-coffin, a white butterfly rests on her fingers. In many cultures, from the Christian Irish to the Baluba from central Zaire, the soul of a person emerges from the cocoon (the grave) and flies away in the form of a butterfly. Sokurov leaves us guessing at the end of the film: on the mother's gray, emaciated hand, the butterfly is still there. "Mother and Son" is an experience much more than it is a film. We are confronted with a continuum of painted scenes, as we would in any museum. We are drawn into each scene as we would be drawn into each painting, reflecting on content which raises in us a myriad of emotions -- some from long ago, forgotten -- or provokes new reflection. All of these emotions appear and disappear in dream-like fashion and in so doing, we partake in the mystery and complexity of the love between a mother and her son.

    The film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their living in very poor conditions. It shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). But what do we see further? After their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. It is not possible. A person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. He would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. Another thing. The author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see he learned many Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. Someone has compared this film with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.
