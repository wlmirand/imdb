 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Hank Marshall is a tough, square-jawed, straitlaced Army engineer and nuclear science expert, assigned to help conduct weapons-testing in 1950's America. Hank has become a thorn in the side of the Army, though, for a couple of very different reasons. He is an outspoken opponent of atmospheric testing, though his superiors hold contrary views and want to squelch his concerns...and his reports. The other problem is his wife, Carly. She is voluptuous and volatile, wreaking havoc in his personal life and stirring up intrigue at each new Army base.

    Shot in the Fall/Spring of 1989-90, "Blue Sky" wasn't actually released until 1994. The story involves a military family in the early 60s who move to an Alabama base. The wife (Jessica Lange) is erratic & bipolar and behaves like a loony Marilyn Monroe while the husband (Tommy Lee Jones) is unshakably faithful. The two daughters lament their mother's disorder, but the family's strong nevertheless. When the father goes to Nevada to work with bomb testing the commander of the base (Powers Boothe) has his eyes on the sexpot wife. I don't follow film awards, but Jessica won an Oscar for her performance as the hysterical wife and she deserved it. For this reason many hail the first two acts of the film, and Tommy Lee as well. Unfortunately, her character comes across as unlikable and even scary. You start to feel sad for the daughters! Some people criticize Boothe as being too dastardly of a villain. Don't believe it. Do these critics really think there aren't any high-ranking military personnel with a Genghis Khan complex? Men who think they're above the rules and can get away with anything their arrogant butts' desire? Boothe's character comes across as a solid military leader who's tempted by a subordinate's sultry wife and then does everything he can to save himself. This type of behavior is older than David and Bathsheba. Some complain about how unbelievable the last act is. Two things: (1.) This is a movie and movies always amp up the dramatics. The filmmakers essentially have to do this because, well, it's a movie and they only have 2 hours to tell the story. (2.) Besides, the film's making a point about Lange's character and it's important to the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** It shows that, as erratic and unlikable as she is in the first two acts, she redeems herself by literally risking everything for her husband. It's a powerful and necessary point. ***END SPOILER*** This is also a good film about life on a military base, like "The Great Santini" with some similarities to "Desert Bloom", albeit not quite as good as either. The film was shot in Selma, Alabama, Florida and El Paso, Texas. It runs 101 minutes. GRADE: B

    Jessica Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance in 'Blue Sky', is Stunning! The 2-Time Academy-Award Winning Legendary Actress once again lights the screen on fire by delivering such a stunning performance. 'Blue Sky' is set in the 1960's, where a nuclear engineer faces a lot of difficulties in his professional & personal life. 'Blue Sky' is a depressing film. The journey its characters go through, the entire story, is very depressing. But, that's exactly how this story is supposed to be: Difficult & Unsettling. It's certainly not meant for the Faint-Hearted, as the drama in here is No-Holds-Barred. Rama Laurie Stagner, Arlene Sarner & Jerry Leichtling's Screenplay is devastating & very effective. Tony Richardson's Direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are nice. Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance is the prime reason to watch 'Blue Sky'. It's an unforgettable performance, that leaves an haunting impact. Also Terrific is Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the troubled husband, with great control & understanding. On the whole, 'Blue Sky' is depressing, but Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance makes it a must see. Strongly Recommended!

    Jessica Lang plays a crazy wife to an Army Officer (Tommy Lee Jones) with 2 daughters who is upset because they have been relocated to a Southern base for his latest assignment. Lang plays the role well and she is the highlight. Tommy Lee Jones is OK here but his best part of the film is early on. When they first get on the new base, Lang has a fit and Jones tries to shield the daughters from their mother. After this high point, his role starts to decline as Lang takes over the movie. The relationship between Lang and the daughters is strained at best, insane at it's worst. Meanwhile, Jones is sent away on the Blue Skies assignment. First her daughter and the son of the base commander raise a riot by accidentally detonating a Grenade by an abandoned hut. Then, they catch the base commander having relations with Lang there. The older daughter forces mom to call Jones and confess. The Base commander then sets up Jones by putting him (with Lang's permission) into the base hospital on drugs and helpless. Lang opens up her husband's Blue Sky notes and comes up with a plan to try and get her husband free. What is in his notes is the key to her plan. She is not as crazy as you might think. There are a couple of holes here, especially because since the kids catch Lang & the base commander, it is hard to understand why just taking dad out of action is going to protect their secret. The son's reaction, must less the daughter's to this seems wrong. While the plot is a little off, it is a pretty decent film to watch.

    "Blue Sky" might have made for a great night of television had it premiered on HBO or Showtime as a cable-film. With somewhat reduced expectations coupled with the intimacy of watching the movie on the small screen, one might be inclined to forgive the film for its lack of scope. Set in Alabama in the mid-1950s, Jessica Lange plays an Army Engineer's wife and the mother of two young girls who is tired of being dragged from one military home to the next. She harbors a dangerous, possibly manic-depressive side, and makes life difficult for everybody--leaving a trail of gossip and bad blood behind her. Tommy Lee Jones is her patient, loving husband, and Powers Boothe is Jones' newest Commanding Officer who sees only Lange's sexy externals and desires her. All three performances are very good (with Lange winning the Best Actress Oscar, possibly due to a slow year for women in film), however the picture takes a wrong turn in its third act and finishes limply. Wolfish Boothe becomes a deceitful villain (as if being a cheating husband wasn't quite enough), while Lange's volatile Carly is sent out on a limb to save her husband from the clutches of the ignorant, power-hungry government. Had the script stayed true to the character conflicts (which would have matched the film's modest budget), this may have been an effective little soaper. But there are too many ambitious ideas cranked out in the final stages, and the editing darts around trying to round off scenes which are squashy and dramatically unfulfilled. It isn't the fault of the actors; the movie becomes so hectic in its plotting that the puny returns we do get (and the overall lack of vision) are not enough to satisfy. "Blue Sky" bites off more than it can possibly chew. **1/2 from ****

    It is always a pleasure to watch giants in some film which is driven not by effects , explosions and rap-style language but by old-fashioned story and , simply , eye-popping acting , and two main actors , Mr T. Jones and , specially , Mme J. Lange deliver this in full . This smaller , cheaper film deals with the relationships between the military personnel and their spouses , where J. Lange portrays perfectly a lascivious southern belle with too grand illusions of an acting career, who with her sexual escapades becomes a sort of house-hold name in all the bases her husband is sent to , she being slightly neurotic , while tensions and constant arguments between the two are a norm , and their two beautiful daughters watch this in silence , being even more mature then their own mother . It is interesting to see Jones 's character always forgiving his wife , loving her completely , never hitting her , or calling her names .And when the viewer is almost certain that a typical and clich&eacute;d climax is inevitable , i.e. a fight between the couple with him stabbing his wife , the film takes a completely different turn , where Lange's character shows her southern true mettle and love for her husband, who becomes a victim of higher national interests . Briefly , a school of great , traditional acting ,light years away from today's self-proclaimed thespians with artificially rounded lips or feminine neurotic outbursts for no reasons , being on the same level as small children demanding a candy .

    The problem comes from the fact that I (and my wife) found it hard to watch Lang's performance and feel much, if any sympathy for her. Yeah, sure, she's bi-polar, but so what? She needs to be taking her meds, although being married to enabler Tommy Lee, who has seemingly never asked himself (or her). 'what the heck are you doin' and why?' has added to the problem. The film takes it's time setting up the crisis, then solves it easily and quickly. But, as they all ride off into the sunset, laughing, you have to ask yourself, 'when is this going to happen again?' And, when it does, what will happen then? No reason to suspect things will be any better, or any different. Which is also fine, but then, why are they laughing? Sorry, for me, it simply doesn't generate any sympathy or empathy for the lead characters. It may be good acting, but the director needed to take a hard look at the lack of empathy created and do something about it.

    In its only nomination in the Oscar sweepstakes for 1994 Jessica Lange won for Best Actress in Blue Sky. After watching Blue Sky I can certainly see why. Blue Sky is set in the years of the Kennedy Administration and it's plot concerns a dedicated Army Major, Tommy Lee Jones and his family consisting of wife Jessica Lange and daughters Amy Locane and Anna Klump. Jones is more than an army officer, he's a nuclear scientist and deeply concerned about the collateral effects of radiation on the population. I well remember the time. President Eisenhower in his second term of office made an unilateral executive decision to stop above ground nuclear testing, but the Russians continued. I well remember Premier Khrushchev in a bit of saber rattling, exploded a one hundred megaton hydrogen bomb. Anyway President Kennedy decided at one point to resume nuclear testing to get the Russians back to the bargaining table for a nuclear test ban treaty. That's the background for this story and we all know that the first thaw in the Cold War was that test ban treaty that was ratified during the summer of 1963. Anyway Jones is looking to ban it all, writing all kinds of reports that the army isn't taking too seriously and in fact transfers him from California to Alabama where he's told in no uncertain terms by his commander Powers Boothe to cool it. The military wasn't exactly thrilled with what Kennedy was trying to do. But Jones has some pressing concerns on the domestic front. Jessica Lange is a lusty woman with needs and her husband isn't doing right by her. She looks like Marilyn Monroe and really does have all the army polishing its brass for her. Including Powers Boothe who sends Jones away so they can play. It all ends in disaster, but Jessica summons up a lot more character than we would have first given her credit for to right the situation. It's in those last scenes that Jessica Lange brought home Oscar. Young Chris O'Donnell is in the cast as well as Carrie Snodgrass as the son and wife of Boothe and O'Donnell the young man about to go to West Point finds out just what kind of rat his father really is. And Boothe does very well as the rat. But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky

    This film had some really interesting scenes that made me watch the movie twice but that was enough. The story overall is a bit too messy. Jessica Lange was a hoot as the manic-depressive flirtatious wife of Army Major "Hank Marshall." Boy, poor Hank had his hands full with "Carly" as his wife. Lange plays the role a little over-the-top but that's what makes her interesting here. It turns out to be a military soap opera film, if there is such a thing. The soap angle came in not just between the Major trying to control his out-of- control wife, but the couple's poor daughters who had to live with this under their roof. Amy Klempp and Amy Locane played the sympathetic daughters. There's more to the story, such as incidental things like nuclear bomb testing but, believe-it-or-not, that takes a back seat to Jones and Lange's marital woes. Frankly. when I write this, over 10 years after seeing the film, I wonder why I bothered watching this twice. I was a big fan of Jones, and maybe that was it, plus Lange looked good back then playing the blonde bombshell. This is one of the last films in which she looked this good as her "Tootsie" days were starting to wan.

    This movie proves one important thing, a wonderful performance can save the whole movie. And Jessica Lange won her second Oscar by this film. I think the plot is fine, it could be made better, but if consider it's Tony Richardson's last film, maybe we cannot be too picky. A desperate wife had an affair with his officer husband's military colleague, after her husband was framed o be responsible for a nuclear experiment failure by the colleague, and sent to a mental hospital. She finally realized what was most important in her life and she managed to rescue her husband from the wrong accusation. Jessica acted a beautiful married woman whose husband was a military officer, they had to move from here to there. Their life is unstable because Jessica had become tired of this kind of living, and she could not let her life end like other officers' wives', spiritless, boring and charmless. She released her own enchantment, became outstanding among others, caused a love affair with a man, but eventually she woke up when she would lose her husband forever. The relationship between husband and wife is the main core of this film, and thanks to Jessica's incredible performance, the change of her character is so convincing and touching in some level, although the rescue part was too hasty and questionable. Jessica is definitely the only star of this film, so adorable and beautiful at that age. Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe are just okay. I think this film can be re-maked but I do have no idea which actress can make it better!

    There is an old Calypso ditty that states "If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never take a pretty woman to be your wife." If you want to have a career in the Army, you might also want to avoid bi-polar women. Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) was an Army Major, a nuclear engineer working on atomic tests, that had a gorgeous wife who was a little crazy. Jessica Lange (Broken Flowers) was awesome as his wife and won every award that year for her performance. She deserved every win in a movie that was a testament to love. No matter how crazy, Major Marshall (Jones) was there for her because of his love. And her love brought her out of her disorder long enough to save him. This was director Tony Richardson's last film and he made it a winner all the way.

That's the background for this story and we all know that the first thaw in the Cold War was that test ban treaty that was ratified during the summer of 1963. Anyway Jones is looking to ban it all, writing all kinds of reports that the army isn't taking too seriously and in fact transfers him from California to Alabama where he's told in no uncertain terms by his commander Powers Boothe to cool it. The military wasn't exactly thrilled with what Kennedy was trying to do. But Jones has some pressing concerns on the domestic front. Jessica Lange is a lusty woman with needs and her husband isn't doing right by her. She looks like Marilyn Monroe and really does have all the army polishing its brass for her. Including Powers Boothe who sends Jones away so they can play. It all ends in disaster, but Jessica summons up a lot more character than we would have first given her credit for to right the situation. It's in those last scenes that Jessica Lange brought home Oscar. Young Chris O'Donnell is in the cast as well as Carrie Snodgrass as the son and wife of Boothe and O'Donnell the young man about to go to West Point finds out just what kind of rat his father really is. And Boothe does very well as the rat. But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky

    This film had some really interesting scenes that made me watch the movie twice but that was enough. The story overall is a bit too messy. Jessica Lange was a hoot as the manic-depressive flirtatious wife of Army Major "Hank Marshall." Boy, poor Hank had his hands full with "Carly" as his wife. Lange plays the role a little over-the-top but that's what makes her interesting here. It turns out to be a military soap opera film, if there is such a thing. The soap angle came in not just between the Major trying to control his out-of- control wife, but the couple's poor daughters who had to live with this under their roof. Amy Klempp and Amy Locane played the sympathetic daughters. There's more to the story, such as incidental things like nuclear bomb testing but, believe-it-or-not, that takes a back seat to Jones and Lange's marital woes. Frankly. when I write this, over 10 years after seeing the film, I wonder why I bothered watching this twice. I was a big fan of Jones, and maybe that was it, plus Lange looked good back then playing the blonde bombshell. This is one of the last films in which she looked this good as her "Tootsie" days were starting to wan.

    This movie proves one important thing, a wonderful performance can save the whole movie. And Jessica Lange won her second Oscar by this film. I think the plot is fine, it could be made better, but if consider it's Tony Richardson's last film, maybe we cannot be too picky. A desperate wife had an affair with his officer husband's military colleague, after her husband was framed o be responsible for a nuclear experiment failure by the colleague, and sent to a mental hospital. She finally realized what was most important in her life and she managed to rescue her husband from the wrong accusation. Jessica acted a beautiful married woman whose husband was a military officer, they had to move from here to there. Their life is unstable because Jessica had become tired of this kind of living, and she could not let her life end like other officers' wives', spiritless, boring and charmless. She released her own enchantment, became outstanding among others, caused a love affair with a man, but eventually she woke up when she would lose her husband forever. The relationship between husband and wife is the main core of this film, and thanks to Jessica's incredible performance, the change of her character is so convincing and touching in some level, although the rescue part was too hasty and questionable. Jessica is definitely the only star of this film, so adorable and beautiful at that age. Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe are just okay. I think this film can be re-maked but I do have no idea which actress can make it better!

    There is an old Calypso ditty that states "If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never take a pretty woman to be your wife." If you want to have a career in the Army, you might also want to avoid bi-polar women. Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) was an Army Major, a nuclear engineer working on atomic tests, that had a gorgeous wife who was a little crazy. Jessica Lange (Broken Flowers) was awesome as his wife and won every award that year for her performance. She deserved every win in a movie that was a testament to love. No matter how crazy, Major Marshall (Jones) was there for her because of his love. And her love brought her out of her disorder long enough to save him. This was director Tony Richardson's last film and he made it a winner all the way.

    Shot in the Fall/Spring of 1989-90, "Blue Sky" wasn't actually released until 1994. The story involves a military family in the early 60s who move to an Alabama base. The wife (Jessica Lange) is erratic & bipolar and behaves like a loony Marilyn Monroe while the husband (Tommy Lee Jones) is unshakably faithful. The two daughters lament their mother's disorder, but the family's strong nevertheless. When the father goes to Nevada to work with bomb testing the commander of the base (Powers Boothe) has his eyes on the sexpot wife. I don't follow film awards, but Jessica won an Oscar for her performance as the hysterical wife and she deserved it. For this reason many hail the first two acts of the film, and Tommy Lee as well. Unfortunately, her character comes across as unlikable and even scary. You start to feel sad for the daughters! Some people criticize Boothe as being too dastardly of a villain. Don't believe it. Do these critics really think there aren't any high-ranking military personnel with a Genghis Khan complex? Men who think they're above the rules and can get away with anything their arrogant butts' desire? Boothe's character comes across as a solid military leader who's tempted by a subordinate's sultry wife and then does everything he can to save himself. This type of behavior is older than David and Bathsheba. Some complain about how unbelievable the last act is. Two things: (1.) This is a movie and movies always amp up the dramatics. The filmmakers essentially have to do this because, well, it's a movie and they only have 2 hours to tell the story. (2.) Besides, the film's making a point about Lange's character and it's important to the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** It shows that, as erratic and unlikable as she is in the first two acts, she redeems herself by literally risking everything for her husband. It's a powerful and necessary point. ***END SPOILER*** This is also a good film about life on a military base, like "The Great Santini" with some similarities to "Desert Bloom", albeit not quite as good as either. The film was shot in Selma, Alabama, Florida and El Paso, Texas. It runs 101 minutes. GRADE: B

    Jessica Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance in 'Blue Sky', is Stunning! The 2-Time Academy-Award Winning Legendary Actress once again lights the screen on fire by delivering such a stunning performance. 'Blue Sky' is set in the 1960's, where a nuclear engineer faces a lot of difficulties in his professional & personal life. 'Blue Sky' is a depressing film. The journey its characters go through, the entire story, is very depressing. But, that's exactly how this story is supposed to be: Difficult & Unsettling. It's certainly not meant for the Faint-Hearted, as the drama in here is No-Holds-Barred. Rama Laurie Stagner, Arlene Sarner & Jerry Leichtling's Screenplay is devastating & very effective. Tony Richardson's Direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are nice. Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance is the prime reason to watch 'Blue Sky'. It's an unforgettable performance, that leaves an haunting impact. Also Terrific is Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the troubled husband, with great control & understanding. On the whole, 'Blue Sky' is depressing, but Lange's Oscar-Winning Performance makes it a must see. Strongly Recommended!

    Jessica Lang plays a crazy wife to an Army Officer (Tommy Lee Jones) with 2 daughters who is upset because they have been relocated to a Southern base for his latest assignment. Lang plays the role well and she is the highlight. Tommy Lee Jones is OK here but his best part of the film is early on. When they first get on the new base, Lang has a fit and Jones tries to shield the daughters from their mother. After this high point, his role starts to decline as Lang takes over the movie. The relationship between Lang and the daughters is strained at best, insane at it's worst. Meanwhile, Jones is sent away on the Blue Skies assignment. First her daughter and the son of the base commander raise a riot by accidentally detonating a Grenade by an abandoned hut. Then, they catch the base commander having relations with Lang there. The older daughter forces mom to call Jones and confess. The Base commander then sets up Jones by putting him (with Lang's permission) into the base hospital on drugs and helpless. Lang opens up her husband's Blue Sky notes and comes up with a plan to try and get her husband free. What is in his notes is the key to her plan. She is not as crazy as you might think. There are a couple of holes here, especially because since the kids catch Lang & the base commander, it is hard to understand why just taking dad out of action is going to protect their secret. The son's reaction, must less the daughter's to this seems wrong. While the plot is a little off, it is a pretty decent film to watch.

    "Blue Sky" might have made for a great night of television had it premiered on HBO or Showtime as a cable-film. With somewhat reduced expectations coupled with the intimacy of watching the movie on the small screen, one might be inclined to forgive the film for its lack of scope. Set in Alabama in the mid-1950s, Jessica Lange plays an Army Engineer's wife and the mother of two young girls who is tired of being dragged from one military home to the next. She harbors a dangerous, possibly manic-depressive side, and makes life difficult for everybody--leaving a trail of gossip and bad blood behind her. Tommy Lee Jones is her patient, loving husband, and Powers Boothe is Jones' newest Commanding Officer who sees only Lange's sexy externals and desires her. All three performances are very good (with Lange winning the Best Actress Oscar, possibly due to a slow year for women in film), however the picture takes a wrong turn in its third act and finishes limply. Wolfish Boothe becomes a deceitful villain (as if being a cheating husband wasn't quite enough), while Lange's volatile Carly is sent out on a limb to save her husband from the clutches of the ignorant, power-hungry government. Had the script stayed true to the character conflicts (which would have matched the film's modest budget), this may have been an effective little soaper. But there are too many ambitious ideas cranked out in the final stages, and the editing darts around trying to round off scenes which are squashy and dramatically unfulfilled. It isn't the fault of the actors; the movie becomes so hectic in its plotting that the puny returns we do get (and the overall lack of vision) are not enough to satisfy. "Blue Sky" bites off more than it can possibly chew. **1/2 from ****

    It is always a pleasure to watch giants in some film which is driven not by effects , explosions and rap-style language but by old-fashioned story and , simply , eye-popping acting , and two main actors , Mr T. Jones and , specially , Mme J. Lange deliver this in full . This smaller , cheaper film deals with the relationships between the military personnel and their spouses , where J. Lange portrays perfectly a lascivious southern belle with too grand illusions of an acting career, who with her sexual escapades becomes a sort of house-hold name in all the bases her husband is sent to , she being slightly neurotic , while tensions and constant arguments between the two are a norm , and their two beautiful daughters watch this in silence , being even more mature then their own mother . It is interesting to see Jones 's character always forgiving his wife , loving her completely , never hitting her , or calling her names .And when the viewer is almost certain that a typical and clich&eacute;d climax is inevitable , i.e. a fight between the couple with him stabbing his wife , the film takes a completely different turn , where Lange's character shows her southern true mettle and love for her husband, who becomes a victim of higher national interests . Briefly , a school of great , traditional acting ,light years away from today's self-proclaimed thespians with artificially rounded lips or feminine neurotic outbursts for no reasons , being on the same level as small children demanding a candy .

    The problem comes from the fact that I (and my wife) found it hard to watch Lang's performance and feel much, if any sympathy for her. Yeah, sure, she's bi-polar, but so what? She needs to be taking her meds, although being married to enabler Tommy Lee, who has seemingly never asked himself (or her). 'what the heck are you doin' and why?' has added to the problem. The film takes it's time setting up the crisis, then solves it easily and quickly. But, as they all ride off into the sunset, laughing, you have to ask yourself, 'when is this going to happen again?' And, when it does, what will happen then? No reason to suspect things will be any better, or any different. Which is also fine, but then, why are they laughing? Sorry, for me, it simply doesn't generate any sympathy or empathy for the lead characters. It may be good acting, but the director needed to take a hard look at the lack of empathy created and do something about it.

    In its only nomination in the Oscar sweepstakes for 1994 Jessica Lange won for Best Actress in Blue Sky. After watching Blue Sky I can certainly see why. Blue Sky is set in the years of the Kennedy Administration and it's plot concerns a dedicated Army Major, Tommy Lee Jones and his family consisting of wife Jessica Lange and daughters Amy Locane and Anna Klump. Jones is more than an army officer, he's a nuclear scientist and deeply concerned about the collateral effects of radiation on the population. I well remember the time. President Eisenhower in his second term of office made an unilateral executive decision to stop above ground nuclear testing, but the Russians continued. I well remember Premier Khrushchev in a bit of saber rattling, exploded a one hundred megaton hydrogen bomb. Anyway President Kennedy decided at one point to resume nuclear testing to get the Russians back to the bargaining table for a nuclear test ban treaty. That's the background for this story and we all know that the first thaw in the Cold War was that test ban treaty that was ratified during the summer of 1963. Anyway Jones is looking to ban it all, writing all kinds of reports that the army isn't taking too seriously and in fact transfers him from California to Alabama where he's told in no uncertain terms by his commander Powers Boothe to cool it. The military wasn't exactly thrilled with what Kennedy was trying to do. But Jones has some pressing concerns on the domestic front. Jessica Lange is a lusty woman with needs and her husband isn't doing right by her. She looks like Marilyn Monroe and really does have all the army polishing its brass for her. Including Powers Boothe who sends Jones away so they can play. It all ends in disaster, but Jessica summons up a lot more character than we would have first given her credit for to right the situation. It's in those last scenes that Jessica Lange brought home Oscar. Young Chris O'Donnell is in the cast as well as Carrie Snodgrass as the son and wife of Boothe and O'Donnell the young man about to go to West Point finds out just what kind of rat his father really is. And Boothe does very well as the rat. But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky
