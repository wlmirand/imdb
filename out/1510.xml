    Depending on the day you're having or the way you look at films, "Mad Dog Time" can become a case of a watchable film or one of the most saddening things ever made. But it can't be great. The cast is amazing, perhaps the main reason most people are brought into this thing but they can't save this from being just an average experiment, almost embarrassing each minute goes by. What was this about anyway? At my view it was a competition of who kills who and who stays longer alive in a game triggered after the release of a powerful mobster (Richard Dreyfuss). Release from where? Jail, mental institution? A little unclear to me. But who were those people? It's a star parade with Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Gabriel Byrne, Diane Lane, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago, Burt Reynolds, Richard Pryor, Henry Silva, so and so, but who were they? Mobsters, hit men, rivals, partners? Nothing is well established in this half wreck, neither their functions except killing each other, neither their purpose behind such cruel intentions. The little character development created by writer/director/supporting actor Larry Bishop is preposterous, ludicrous and silly, and the mountains of dialogs lead to almost nowhere trying to be important with characters asking to each other what's their life's philosophy. The good things about "Mad Dog Time": Gabriel Byrne saves the day becoming the funniest actor on scene; Goldblum is a great presence, we cheer for him whenever he's involved in a gun duel; Hines impress in the brief appearances he has; the rest of the cast is just fine to see them acting together and that's it. Perhaps that's the greatest accomplish in here, see them assembled in one piece of film. If only in a better one... 6/10

    I cannot understand why this movie doesn't have better ratings or a better box office. I'm a harsh critic of movies --- I probably stop watching twice as many as I watch fully, because they're heading into clich&eacute;, want to be funny but aren't, or simply bore me. But I loved this movie. I loved the way it kept being funny without making a big deal of it. I loved the way it mocked the gangster movie ethos. And I loved the cool calm assuredness of Jeff Goldblum's character --- competence and intelligence in a character, without either histrionics or "flaws to make him more interesting" are so appealing.

    It used to be in the sixties, that with enough money, clout or talent, a man could not only Write, Produce, Direct and even star in the same film. Well, here's one. If you look closely enough, you can see writer, Directer and producer, Larry Bishop in this surprise hit called " Mad Dog Time. " Of course, if you look closer, you can recognize a whole Plethora of great stars in the same film. The movie tells the story of Vic, a Mob Boss (Richard Dreyfuss) who lost his mind and was institutionalized. Unfortunately, for his organization, he is now due to be released and Woe betide his henchmen for conspiring to remove him and take over the outfit. Jeff GoldBlum stars as Mickey Holliday, his right hand man and the fastest shooter around. It is he who must now answer the most serious questions to Vic as to what the gang has been doing in his absence. Gabriel Byrne, Henry Silva, Michael J. Pollard and Gregory Hines, head the list of all the people who work for the boss, unlike Burt Reynolds who top the list of enemies, like Joey Bishop, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago and Christopher Jones. Other Hollywood notables like Paul Anka, Richard Pryor and Rob Reiner also make very brief appearances. Still, this black comedy is a good story, but one must pay attention, else the plot can escape you. Some tense and exciting moments are reserved for the ending. Indeed, the lavish sets, beautiful Women or Molls, Goldblum's youthful and stylish characterization lend their weight to give this movie a nod towards eventually becoming a gangster Classic. Recommended for those who seek a civilized man's movie. ****

    If the Godfather can be rated as the greatest of realistic crime or gangster movies then Mad Dog Time should be rated as the greatest of surrealistic movies. This is a film which takes the serious reality of the mob world of killers and shows them in a strange weird way that should rate this film as one of the great films of the cinema art. It is like watching mobsters in a way the painter Picasso viewed reality with his famous Cubism. In some ways it is Film Noir but in other ways it is comic and even romantic. If you want to see a different kind of crime movie that is well acted and whose meaning may be no more than the art of strange film or showing what creative film making can do, then catch this one.

    I read a few of the reviews that tossed this film "under the bus" Decided I would give it a try anyway. After all I like most of the players that graced the stage in this unbelievable waste of film. The plot starts a bit thin and never gets any deeper. A crime boss that commits himself then decides he's OK(or does he?) must get his town in order and re-connect with the only woman that can touch his jaded,bipolar,sociopathic heart.(that old chestnut) Two hours of horrible dialog and even worse acting comes to a climax with predictable stupidity. The over cool good guys and wise cracking bad guy face off in a scenario that was meant to be exciting and unpredictable.I must say this actually hurt me to watch. Any time you have to have two of the main characters spend three or more minutes explaining what just happened, there is a good chance it was too ridiculous for the average person connect the dots. Then when the dots are connected you realize it wasn't worth connecting after all. And did I mention terrible acting? Ellen Barkin did an OK job the rest,especially Dreyfuss,were horrendous. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster. Your time would be better spent watching infomercials or pulling your fingernails off.

    Yes this is one of the best mafia style movies I have ever seen. I did not realize Jeff Goldblum had made a mafia movie until I caught this movie on a movie channel, possibly on my Independent Films Channel not 100% sure on that though. However I give this a 10 out of 10 simply because every big star in this movie was awesome in their roles, especially Goldblum, but R. Dreyfus, H. Silva, B. Reynolds, J. Bishop L. Bishop, G. Hines, G. Byrne and of course the women in this film Barkin, Layne, Everhart were phenomenal as well. This film is in my top five best ever mafia style movies that necessarily didn't over do it with violence and gun shootouts but it seemed to have just enough violence to make it more realistic and true to life. The story line was great as well and I can't express how much I enjoyed this movie and will buy it on DVD soon! I don't understand what is with Hollywood and why they can't produce great movies such as this one. I agree with a prior comment on how little notoriety this movie got and how hard it is to find it playing on TV, makes little sense to me. But as I always say the best movies don't come out of Hollywood but through Independent films sources more often than not.

    So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert's book "I hated, hated, hated this movie" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor". So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert's review of Rob Reiner's "North" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this "movie" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra's "My Way" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that "Independence Day" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that "Independence Day" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if "Independence Day" were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of "Mad Dog Time" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of "Mad Dog Time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

    Loopy, but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a mental hospital. Several of Vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman "Brass Balls" Ben London (a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan), and vicious rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) all try to bump Vic off. Meanwhile, laid-back and self-assured hit-man Mickey Holliday (nicely played with low-key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy. Writer/director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip, quirky, and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok. The bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as tough, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's reliable right-hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's sweet, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick. Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug, Michael J. Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as mortician Mr. Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight. A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical. Frank Byers' slick cinematography, the outrageously nutty dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio.

    "Mad Dog Time"..."Trigger Happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out Comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in "Dreyfus's Club" or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. 4/10 I don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.

    Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." Lane is his girl who's been messing around with his Number One (Goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with Lane's sister (Barkin). With what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor) can't help this plot, as Dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight. You know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. The actual reason I picked this movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. The real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). Even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. The parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on. 3 out of 10 stars.

Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of "Mad Dog Time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

    Loopy, but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a mental hospital. Several of Vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman "Brass Balls" Ben London (a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan), and vicious rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) all try to bump Vic off. Meanwhile, laid-back and self-assured hit-man Mickey Holliday (nicely played with low-key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy. Writer/director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip, quirky, and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok. The bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as tough, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's reliable right-hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's sweet, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick. Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug, Michael J. Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as mortician Mr. Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight. A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical. Frank Byers' slick cinematography, the outrageously nutty dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio.

    "Mad Dog Time"..."Trigger Happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out Comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in "Dreyfus's Club" or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. 4/10 I don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.

    Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." Lane is his girl who's been messing around with his Number One (Goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with Lane's sister (Barkin). With what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor) can't help this plot, as Dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight. You know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. The actual reason I picked this movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. The real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). Even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. The parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on. 3 out of 10 stars.

    Depending on the day you're having or the way you look at films, "Mad Dog Time" can become a case of a watchable film or one of the most saddening things ever made. But it can't be great. The cast is amazing, perhaps the main reason most people are brought into this thing but they can't save this from being just an average experiment, almost embarrassing each minute goes by. What was this about anyway? At my view it was a competition of who kills who and who stays longer alive in a game triggered after the release of a powerful mobster (Richard Dreyfuss). Release from where? Jail, mental institution? A little unclear to me. But who were those people? It's a star parade with Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Gabriel Byrne, Diane Lane, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago, Burt Reynolds, Richard Pryor, Henry Silva, so and so, but who were they? Mobsters, hit men, rivals, partners? Nothing is well established in this half wreck, neither their functions except killing each other, neither their purpose behind such cruel intentions. The little character development created by writer/director/supporting actor Larry Bishop is preposterous, ludicrous and silly, and the mountains of dialogs lead to almost nowhere trying to be important with characters asking to each other what's their life's philosophy. The good things about "Mad Dog Time": Gabriel Byrne saves the day becoming the funniest actor on scene; Goldblum is a great presence, we cheer for him whenever he's involved in a gun duel; Hines impress in the brief appearances he has; the rest of the cast is just fine to see them acting together and that's it. Perhaps that's the greatest accomplish in here, see them assembled in one piece of film. If only in a better one... 6/10

    I cannot understand why this movie doesn't have better ratings or a better box office. I'm a harsh critic of movies --- I probably stop watching twice as many as I watch fully, because they're heading into clich&eacute;, want to be funny but aren't, or simply bore me. But I loved this movie. I loved the way it kept being funny without making a big deal of it. I loved the way it mocked the gangster movie ethos. And I loved the cool calm assuredness of Jeff Goldblum's character --- competence and intelligence in a character, without either histrionics or "flaws to make him more interesting" are so appealing.

    It used to be in the sixties, that with enough money, clout or talent, a man could not only Write, Produce, Direct and even star in the same film. Well, here's one. If you look closely enough, you can see writer, Directer and producer, Larry Bishop in this surprise hit called " Mad Dog Time. " Of course, if you look closer, you can recognize a whole Plethora of great stars in the same film. The movie tells the story of Vic, a Mob Boss (Richard Dreyfuss) who lost his mind and was institutionalized. Unfortunately, for his organization, he is now due to be released and Woe betide his henchmen for conspiring to remove him and take over the outfit. Jeff GoldBlum stars as Mickey Holliday, his right hand man and the fastest shooter around. It is he who must now answer the most serious questions to Vic as to what the gang has been doing in his absence. Gabriel Byrne, Henry Silva, Michael J. Pollard and Gregory Hines, head the list of all the people who work for the boss, unlike Burt Reynolds who top the list of enemies, like Joey Bishop, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago and Christopher Jones. Other Hollywood notables like Paul Anka, Richard Pryor and Rob Reiner also make very brief appearances. Still, this black comedy is a good story, but one must pay attention, else the plot can escape you. Some tense and exciting moments are reserved for the ending. Indeed, the lavish sets, beautiful Women or Molls, Goldblum's youthful and stylish characterization lend their weight to give this movie a nod towards eventually becoming a gangster Classic. Recommended for those who seek a civilized man's movie. ****

    If the Godfather can be rated as the greatest of realistic crime or gangster movies then Mad Dog Time should be rated as the greatest of surrealistic movies. This is a film which takes the serious reality of the mob world of killers and shows them in a strange weird way that should rate this film as one of the great films of the cinema art. It is like watching mobsters in a way the painter Picasso viewed reality with his famous Cubism. In some ways it is Film Noir but in other ways it is comic and even romantic. If you want to see a different kind of crime movie that is well acted and whose meaning may be no more than the art of strange film or showing what creative film making can do, then catch this one.

    I read a few of the reviews that tossed this film "under the bus" Decided I would give it a try anyway. After all I like most of the players that graced the stage in this unbelievable waste of film. The plot starts a bit thin and never gets any deeper. A crime boss that commits himself then decides he's OK(or does he?) must get his town in order and re-connect with the only woman that can touch his jaded,bipolar,sociopathic heart.(that old chestnut) Two hours of horrible dialog and even worse acting comes to a climax with predictable stupidity. The over cool good guys and wise cracking bad guy face off in a scenario that was meant to be exciting and unpredictable.I must say this actually hurt me to watch. Any time you have to have two of the main characters spend three or more minutes explaining what just happened, there is a good chance it was too ridiculous for the average person connect the dots. Then when the dots are connected you realize it wasn't worth connecting after all. And did I mention terrible acting? Ellen Barkin did an OK job the rest,especially Dreyfuss,were horrendous. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster. Your time would be better spent watching infomercials or pulling your fingernails off.

    Yes this is one of the best mafia style movies I have ever seen. I did not realize Jeff Goldblum had made a mafia movie until I caught this movie on a movie channel, possibly on my Independent Films Channel not 100% sure on that though. However I give this a 10 out of 10 simply because every big star in this movie was awesome in their roles, especially Goldblum, but R. Dreyfus, H. Silva, B. Reynolds, J. Bishop L. Bishop, G. Hines, G. Byrne and of course the women in this film Barkin, Layne, Everhart were phenomenal as well. This film is in my top five best ever mafia style movies that necessarily didn't over do it with violence and gun shootouts but it seemed to have just enough violence to make it more realistic and true to life. The story line was great as well and I can't express how much I enjoyed this movie and will buy it on DVD soon! I don't understand what is with Hollywood and why they can't produce great movies such as this one. I agree with a prior comment on how little notoriety this movie got and how hard it is to find it playing on TV, makes little sense to me. But as I always say the best movies don't come out of Hollywood but through Independent films sources more often than not.

    So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert's book "I hated, hated, hated this movie" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor". So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert's review of Rob Reiner's "North" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this "movie" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra's "My Way" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that "Independence Day" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that "Independence Day" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if "Independence Day" were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of "Mad Dog Time" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of "Mad Dog Time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

Hines, G. Byrne and of course the women in this film Barkin, Layne, Everhart were phenomenal as well. This film is in my top five best ever mafia style movies that necessarily didn't over do it with violence and gun shootouts but it seemed to have just enough violence to make it more realistic and true to life. The story line was great as well and I can't express how much I enjoyed this movie and will buy it on DVD soon! I don't understand what is with Hollywood and why they can't produce great movies such as this one. I agree with a prior comment on how little notoriety this movie got and how hard it is to find it playing on TV, makes little sense to me. But as I always say the best movies don't come out of Hollywood but through Independent films sources more often than not.

    So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert's book "I hated, hated, hated this movie" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor". So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert's review of Rob Reiner's "North" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this "movie" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra's "My Way" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that "Independence Day" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that "Independence Day" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if "Independence Day" were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of "Mad Dog Time" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of "Mad Dog Time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

    Loopy, but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a mental hospital. Several of Vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman "Brass Balls" Ben London (a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan), and vicious rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) all try to bump Vic off. Meanwhile, laid-back and self-assured hit-man Mickey Holliday (nicely played with low-key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy. Writer/director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip, quirky, and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok. The bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as tough, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's reliable right-hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's sweet, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick. Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug, Michael J. Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as mortician Mr. Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight. A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical. Frank Byers' slick cinematography, the outrageously nutty dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio.

    "Mad Dog Time"..."Trigger Happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out Comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in "Dreyfus's Club" or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. 4/10 I don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.

    Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." Lane is his girl who's been messing around with his Number One (Goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with Lane's sister (Barkin). With what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor) can't help this plot, as Dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight. You know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. The actual reason I picked this movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. The real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). Even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. The parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on. 3 out of 10 stars.

    Depending on the day you're having or the way you look at films, "Mad Dog Time" can become a case of a watchable film or one of the most saddening things ever made. But it can't be great. The cast is amazing, perhaps the main reason most people are brought into this thing but they can't save this from being just an average experiment, almost embarrassing each minute goes by. What was this about anyway? At my view it was a competition of who kills who and who stays longer alive in a game triggered after the release of a powerful mobster (Richard Dreyfuss). Release from where? Jail, mental institution? A little unclear to me. But who were those people? It's a star parade with Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Gabriel Byrne, Diane Lane, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago, Burt Reynolds, Richard Pryor, Henry Silva, so and so, but who were they? Mobsters, hit men, rivals, partners? Nothing is well established in this half wreck, neither their functions except killing each other, neither their purpose behind such cruel intentions. The little character development created by writer/director/supporting actor Larry Bishop is preposterous, ludicrous and silly, and the mountains of dialogs lead to almost nowhere trying to be important with characters asking to each other what's their life's philosophy. The good things about "Mad Dog Time": Gabriel Byrne saves the day becoming the funniest actor on scene; Goldblum is a great presence, we cheer for him whenever he's involved in a gun duel; Hines impress in the brief appearances he has; the rest of the cast is just fine to see them acting together and that's it. Perhaps that's the greatest accomplish in here, see them assembled in one piece of film. If only in a better one... 6/10

    I cannot understand why this movie doesn't have better ratings or a better box office. I'm a harsh critic of movies --- I probably stop watching twice as many as I watch fully, because they're heading into clich&eacute;, want to be funny but aren't, or simply bore me. But I loved this movie. I loved the way it kept being funny without making a big deal of it. I loved the way it mocked the gangster movie ethos. And I loved the cool calm assuredness of Jeff Goldblum's character --- competence and intelligence in a character, without either histrionics or "flaws to make him more interesting" are so appealing.

    It used to be in the sixties, that with enough money, clout or talent, a man could not only Write, Produce, Direct and even star in the same film. Well, here's one. If you look closely enough, you can see writer, Directer and producer, Larry Bishop in this surprise hit called " Mad Dog Time. " Of course, if you look closer, you can recognize a whole Plethora of great stars in the same film. The movie tells the story of Vic, a Mob Boss (Richard Dreyfuss) who lost his mind and was institutionalized. Unfortunately, for his organization, he is now due to be released and Woe betide his henchmen for conspiring to remove him and take over the outfit. Jeff GoldBlum stars as Mickey Holliday, his right hand man and the fastest shooter around. It is he who must now answer the most serious questions to Vic as to what the gang has been doing in his absence. Gabriel Byrne, Henry Silva, Michael J. Pollard and Gregory Hines, head the list of all the people who work for the boss, unlike Burt Reynolds who top the list of enemies, like Joey Bishop, Kyle MacLachlan, Billy Idol, Billy Drago and Christopher Jones. Other Hollywood notables like Paul Anka, Richard Pryor and Rob Reiner also make very brief appearances. Still, this black comedy is a good story, but one must pay attention, else the plot can escape you. Some tense and exciting moments are reserved for the ending. Indeed, the lavish sets, beautiful Women or Molls, Goldblum's youthful and stylish characterization lend their weight to give this movie a nod towards eventually becoming a gangster Classic. Recommended for those who seek a civilized man's movie. ****

    If the Godfather can be rated as the greatest of realistic crime or gangster movies then Mad Dog Time should be rated as the greatest of surrealistic movies. This is a film which takes the serious reality of the mob world of killers and shows them in a strange weird way that should rate this film as one of the great films of the cinema art. It is like watching mobsters in a way the painter Picasso viewed reality with his famous Cubism. In some ways it is Film Noir but in other ways it is comic and even romantic. If you want to see a different kind of crime movie that is well acted and whose meaning may be no more than the art of strange film or showing what creative film making can do, then catch this one.

    I read a few of the reviews that tossed this film "under the bus" Decided I would give it a try anyway. After all I like most of the players that graced the stage in this unbelievable waste of film. The plot starts a bit thin and never gets any deeper. A crime boss that commits himself then decides he's OK(or does he?) must get his town in order and re-connect with the only woman that can touch his jaded,bipolar,sociopathic heart.(that old chestnut) Two hours of horrible dialog and even worse acting comes to a climax with predictable stupidity. The over cool good guys and wise cracking bad guy face off in a scenario that was meant to be exciting and unpredictable.I must say this actually hurt me to watch. Any time you have to have two of the main characters spend three or more minutes explaining what just happened, there is a good chance it was too ridiculous for the average person connect the dots. Then when the dots are connected you realize it wasn't worth connecting after all. And did I mention terrible acting? Ellen Barkin did an OK job the rest,especially Dreyfuss,were horrendous. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster. Your time would be better spent watching infomercials or pulling your fingernails off.
