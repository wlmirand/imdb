  While on a train, a teenage boy thinks about his life and the flamboyant aunt whose friendship acted as an emotional shield from his troubled family. This film evokes the haunting quality of memory while creating a heartfelt portrait of a boy's life in a rural 1940s Southern town.

    This is a film that should appeal greatly to me . It's set against the background of a teenage boy growing up in a small insular town . This mirrors my own earlier life . " No one is allowed an opinion of their own " proclaims protagonist David and it's something I can bitterly relate to . Growing up in a small town is a painful experience especially for an existentialist who is an outsider . You're conditioned to be a nobody . Think of a combination of Lysenkoism and the antithesis of ambition . That's what life is like in a small town the world over . In short this should be a film that takes people in to themselves creating a strong and instant sense of empathy . Alas it;s something of a cinematic disaster The problem lies entirely at the feet of director Terence Davies . He directs in a poetic style or at least attempts to but where as a poetic film by Terewnce Malik or Sam Mendes works here it spectacular fails . . What sinks the film is the unnatural framing where a character is smack bang in the middle of the screen facing the camera . A lot of critics complain that a director like Danny Boyle shoots , frames and edits films in a similar manner but at least he brings a sense of variety to his movies . Here however Davies relies on the exact same framing technique throughout the entire film which sinks it as a cinematic presentation and feels more like a filmed theater play

    Other reviewers have veered either for one star, or ten. I'm going down the middle; four. It is dreamy, corny, beautifully set-staged, almost, but its subject matter isn't. It traipses along as if in a trance, we are either taken in by its beauty or it just passes by, languidly, slowly, and yes, boringly. I can't remember if anyone swore. There was blood, otherwise what happened? People sang quite a lot, embarrassingly, at times, otherwise one contrived scene floated into the next. True, I've not read the book, so cannot compare. I think it could work if perhaps if it was written by Harold Pinter and directed like a Dennis Potter - jet black, violent and maybe then, memorable. As it is, it's soppy, attempting to be different, where being different is like being different in the school playground; it looks odd, that oddness showing up over any potential good and thus making the film simply not work.

    Another question. Did anyone who had a hand in the production of this film bother to watch the daily rushes? I understand that the book this is based on is quite impressive. "Memoir films" are probably the trickiest to execute, especially when the languid rural South is the locale; Without the potent elements of a Tennessee Williams or a Truman Capote, it can all-too-easily result in a real misfire. The handling of the story here is far too lyrical and poetic to have any ring of authenticity. It's as if the director's intent was to make the film so poignant you could die from it (was this secretly a Hallmark Hall Of Fame project?) But the period detail is good, whenever it's not laid on too thick. But sadly, the characters are cardboard, almost "Stepford Wives"-mechanical in their behavior and speech. The pace is, needless to say, fatally slow. And even those physical elements which are easy to devise instead look jarringly artificial and overdone (the too-rhythmic tree movement seen through a window, the life-choking cloud of dust/smoke from a bus, a railroad coach that only rocks when viewed from the outside...and real passenger trains didn't carry a caboose!) My two-star rating here is in acknowledgment of the film's one stand-out asset, Gena Rowlands, an actress who is so thoroughly watchable in anything she does. She breathes the only life into this production, not an easy task, and she makes the most of what was thankfully the most interesting character.

    I would rate Terence Davies as a more important Son of Liverpool than John Lennon, so how about Davies Airport, then? This film goes against the canon of behaviour for the cinema in countless ways, but Davies is one of those masters who knows how the break the rules and achieve results. It is only to be expected that a film so radical in its contempt for conventional film-making as this should arouse a great deal of exasperation and fury amongst viewers who do not know what they are seeing, or cannot understand. The film has an austerity and formality about its construction which reminds me of a Japanese Noh play, and another Oriental touch is the enlarged moon at which the characters are so often staring, and towards which the boy is constantly reaching his hand, as if straining towards some perfection which he knows is forever beyond his reach. But what is so remarkable is that Davies has captured an elusive essence of the American Deep South of the 1940s, as if he were a perfume-manufacturer who had found the recipe for an exotic scent, using materials wholly unfamiliar to him, for after all, Davies is an alien in that world. However, as he shot a lot of the film in Crawfordville, Georgia, which has a population of 572, everybody who visits it could be said to be an alien. He seems to me to have drawn inspiration from the photographs of the Alabamba sharecroppers taken in the late 1930s by Walker Evans for James Agee's book LET US NOW PRAISE FAMOUS MEN, which was published in 1941, the same year which is so important early in this film, in which we hear Roosevelt's broadcast announcing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, which leads to the boy's father going to war and coming back in a box. I am proud to say that I saved the manuscript of Agee's book. I used to stay in Mia Agee's house when I was young, and as she suffered from chronic depression, she was allowing Jim's manuscripts to rot in wet cardboard boxes in the cellar. Once she left me alone in the house for a few days and I took 'direct action' at the request of her daughter. I went down and got the manuscripts and dried them out by laying them all over every surface and floor of the house in relays for days. FAMOUS MEN had fortunately been written in hard pencil, so that there was no ink to run or smudge. It is now safely in the University of Texas, and Mia lived for some time on the money she got for it, once it had been dried! Agee died in 1955, but Walker Evans lived to a ripe old age, though he was such an urbane sophisticate you would never know he had once spent months in a house like the one in this film, and I was unable to get him to talk about it much. This film does not have normal continuity in the cinematic sense, but instead progresses in a series of tableaux. However, the emotional and narrative continuity remains intact and is perfectly comprehensible. The film in that sense resembles poetry rather than prose, and indeed it could be said to obey the strict rules of H. D.'s and Pound's Imagism, whereby every word which does not stand for a concrete image must be cut. (Pound cut Eliot's THE WASTELAND by half in this way prior to publication, which is why it became such a world classic.) THE NEON BIBLE is thus an imagist poem, not a prose piece which rambles along in the normal fashion. I have no idea why it is called THE NEON BIBLE because that must have been explained in the novel which provided the story, and which Davies does not explain. Of course, there is a great deal of preaching and religious intolerance in the film, but why it is neon escapes me, unless perchance neon, being such a rare gas, the degree of religious hypocrisy portrayed is meant to be of an equally rare kind, or perhaps the reference is to neon's unnatural glow, like that which emanates from the putrescence of a fermenting small Southern town, being what is really intended. The central performance as Aunt Mae is by Gena Rowlands, yet another example of her inspired and brilliant work, which has been the continuing hallmark of her career. The other female lead is played by Diana Scarwid, who comes from Savannah, Georgia, and is the only performer in the film who has the correct accent. If I were to criticize this film, I would have to call attention to the fact that the director and cast all have tin ears, and cannot detect that they lack the Georgia accents, apart from Scarwid. Scarwid is marvellous as a woman who goes mad under the strains of poverty, battering by her violent husband, then grief at his death (the Patty Heart Syndrome, where you love your captor, and mourn the passing of your tormentor). Jacob Tierney, a Canadian boy, is superb and sensitive as the son who narrates the tale, and whose story it really is. The cinematography by the Scot Michael Coulter is sensationally evocative and technically brilliant. All that steam and pine branches brushing at the windowpanes (hats off to the sound engineer too for that scene!) and mist and gloom really works, as do the flat-on Walker Evans-style shots where surfaces of buildings and features of rooms are treated as naked planes seen in the perpendicular, and which cannot hide as they are helpless to avoid revealing their all to the unremitting eye. The story is sad, both of loss, and of never having had anything to lose, of the unravelling of hopes and dreams, and of the blows which fate inflicts upon the helpless, full to the brim with sombre pathos.

    Read the book and don't waste your time trying to watch this movie. I am only sorry that I can't give this 0 stars out of 10, but after thinking about it, I realize that there are a few other movies that could be considered worse than this. I consider "Confederacy of Dunces" and "The Neon Bible" worthy of their place on my bookshelf, but this movie belongs in a landfill. I agree with previous comments that the movie suffers from disjointedness. Yes, it is a memory story in the Southern Gothic style, but the book does a much better job of conveying the impact of the varied events of his childhood upon David as he reflects upon them during his train ride. I can only imagine how maddening the movie must be for those who never read the book beforehand - in short, if the movie left you feeling dissatisfied, it is still worth your while to read the book.

    John Kennedy Toole is probably my favorite writer of the 20th century, even though he wrote only two books before committing suicide. One of those books - "A Confederacy of Dunces" - has earned a formidable reputation as a whacked-out, satirical masterpiece (it even won Toole a posthumous Pulitzer). His other book, "The Neon Bible," is far more obscure, sincere and frankly melancholy. I like both books, even though they're very different in terms of style. So, I was naturally quite excited when I stumbled upon the DVD release of this movie; I wasn't even aware that any of Toole's work had been adapted to film. But I was also a little wary. Movies have a tendency to trivialize great books, and I predicted that "The Neon Bible" might, in cinematic form, degenerate into a depressing slog. Alas, my prediction proved true. This movie is a slog. Director Terence Davies paces it like a funeral procession. He also fills the movie with weird, protracted shots of blackness, of whiteness, of starry skies; I imagine he's trying to be deep somehow, but all his slow zooms just bore me. Besides, at times he overplays the starry sky thing so much that it looks like the protagonists live in a cabin in outer space. Both the book and the movie are anecdotal, but the book works because David - the shy teenage "hero" - makes an interesting narrator. His voice binds the anecdotes together, and naturally the reader learns about him through the narration. In this movie, though, he's largely silent; he just lurks around in the background of his own story. And, without his narration, the anecdotal scenes often make little sense and have no apparent connection. I feel guilty about badmouthing this film, to an extent, because it at least strives for faithfulness. But the deadly slow pace really undermines everything. For instance, there's a Christian rally at one point, headed by an evangelist called Bobby Lee Taylor. In the book, this is a rousing set-piece, and Taylor is depicted as an energetic young man who really seems to believe the (ahem) propaganda he spouts. But, in the movie, Taylor is depicted as a lifeless old man, and he basically announces to the audience in an aside that he's a shyster. Ho-hum. That's the Hollywood trivializing machine at work. And the scene as a whole completely lacks energy, verve, oomph - whatever you want to call it. This is going to sound like a strange statement, but I'm starting to develop a love-hate relationship with movies, with the emphasis on hate. It's always easy and tempting to pop a DVD in my player and relax for the evening, but I find lately that I get a lot more out of indulging in the brain-stimulating alternative pastime of reading. After all, books are, on the whole, lots better than movies. Case in point..."The Neon Bible." I still can't stop hoping that, one day, they'll make a movie version of "Confederacy of Dunces." But I bet that'll be inferior to the book, too.

    I really admire the films that Terrence Davies made about growing up in British working class environment after World War II. They're brilliant works. But this is horrifically off the mark. The review of Davies' version of Edith Wharton's *House of Mirth* in the NY Times said that the movie was more like Charles Dickens than Edith Wharton. Which is exactly the criticism I had of this movie. These folks are not embodying American Southern farmers, they're acting like industrial working class people. I can understand and be sympathetic to the original story: my people, coming from South Carolina & Georgia, had lives very similar to the plot of this movie. Therefore, I could see where this could potentially be a very good film. But nothing gets under my skin like an inability to see beyond one's own cultural bias...which is the major mistake of the director of this production. If you take the emotions, the gestures, the imagery of this film and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie. But having people interact and react this way and have them being farmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark. If you want to see true southern Americana, skip this movie and see Elia Kazan's *Wild River* instead...

    Have no idea what this film was made for. Uninteresting plot, pace at most times extremely slow, scary images (this boy with still face - as if made of wax - staring at the moon...), pathetic visual effects. Watched that film in the cinema with 30 other viewers. Half of them left within the first quarter of an hour, the rest decided to give a film a try. After a while irritation turned into disbelief (this film is a joke) and later into amusement (yes, it is a joke!). Thus in the middle of the film I couldn't help it any more and started laughing aloud (watching the scene of murder with storm, lightning and bushes beating furiously in the window) and went on till the END sign. The rest of crowd joined me with relief. Film highly recommended for use in laughter therapy.

    As Davies has said many times, one of the single most important things to remember about his work is that his biggest influence is the Hollywood musicals of the 30s, 40s and 50s. This influence comes across in all of his films and especially with The Neon Bible. Davies is also, in my opinion, one of the few directors who accurately depicts the act of remembering. Without giving anything away, it's always important to keep in mind that David is on a train, thinking and remembering. No one remembers something from the past totally, memory functions like fragments and it's up to us to flesh them out. Sometimes we think of something one way, later another away; forget, remember or distort. David is fleshing out the events of his life and that's th most important thing about the film. Sometimes we remember minute, isolated events... Davies puts those in the film as well. Just sit back and enjoy the pace of this remarkable film from an equally remarkable and brilliant director. A sheet blowing - music from Gone With the Wind - he turns into high drama; Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times' as David begins to hit bottom. It IS a musical - Davies has always used music for forward his narrative and uses it in this film in a more sophisticated way than in his earlier films to even more startling effect. Everyone turns in remarkable performances - the entire cast and the photography is beyond amazing. Davies is the master of the tracking shot. Please, be patient with the pace of the film - sit back and enjoy the ride. Get used to the rhythms and then give all of yourself to the film, jump in. It's beautiful, melancholy and sad. Davies' films are always so full of life and this is no exception. No idea why this film gets a bad rap - hands down, one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It's totally unique - it comes from nowhere. Shots, colors, textures - all perfect. Everything. Enjoy the ride.

    I am sure somebody meant to convey _some_ meaning in this one, and if you have the patience of mountains to last through it (and through all those lengthy shots of drying bedsheets - I'm not kidding!) you will have the better of me. Even if you wasted good money on the ticket, don't lose twice and waste your time. Watch a pebble, try to understand the import it carries..
