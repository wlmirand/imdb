 <sinopse>
  A city girl teams up with a tomboy to solve the mystery of Bear Mountain, Molly Morgan, and the buried treasure as well as learn about true friendships.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Moving from the big city (LA) to a backwater town is always difficult, but especially for the one doing the moving. After her dad's death, Beth Easton and her mother, Kate, move to the house left to the family by a deceased aunt. Kate meets up with several old friends, but Beth has none. Slowly, however, she makes friends, despite the lack of a nearby mall or anything else to do. Soon she meets up with two boys fighting ... except one isn't a boy, but a girl. The girl, Jody, is shunned by her peers as a "bad kid." As the film progresses, we see Jody as the apparent victim of a bad relationship between her own widowed mother and Ray, a man who, like everybody else, grew up in the town. Somehow, Beth sees that Jody isn't all that bad; "she just needs a friend." Beth sticks by her, even when Jody is blamed for almost killing Beth. Jody has a dream, though, a dream of finding lost gold in Bear Mountain, left there by a legendary woman named Molly Morgan. Jody has a map, and she has a "...

    Watched this the first time this morning on HBO and LOVED IT!!! Just ordered the DVD to watch it again when I want to!! Can't believe I never saw it before!! The friendship between the girls is right on, reminds me of being young! LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!! Will recommend it to family and friends, and even let them borrow the DVD I just ordered! I know there are family members who will enjoy it, especially since the whole family can watch it together. This is unusual to find one these days, even programs on regular TV surprise me with some of the language! My DVD will arrive on Wednesday, and I can't wait to watch it again. so many ups and downs in it, was so happy there was a very happy ending! I have four Grandchildren now, so nice to have a good, clean movie for them to watch.

    Before Christina Ricci was truly established as the screen's indie queen, it seems that she mostly starred in what were viewed as family movies. "Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain" is a prime example. It's one of those movies that seems really cool when you're young. My favorite part of the movie was the history of the woman associated with the cave. Otherwise, the movie isn't anything special (especially since 1995 also saw movies like "Smoke" and "Unstrung Heroes"). As for Anna Chlumsky, she also gravitated more towards serious roles as she aged. I'll give the movie that. Also starring Polly Draper, Diana Scarwid (Christina in "Mommie Dearest") and David Keith (Drew Barrymore's father in "Firestarter").

    I have grown to love this film and who have seen this film a zillion times. This movie is based on what friendship really means. The film takes place back in 1980 where Beth Easton(played by Christina Ricci) moves to a small town up north with her mother. There she meets the towns "trouble maker" Jody Salerno(played by Anna Chlumsky) who is right at home in the woods surrounding her. Eventually Beth finds out from the towns people that Jody is impossible to become friends and to not be trusted. Beth somehow sees behind this and how she could be the link to finding adventure. Together they discover a legendary women who possibly hid gold in a cave called Bear Mountain. With there friendship growing more as they trace the steps in finding the gold there becomes a set back. Jody who is symbolized as the bad girl in town is revealed as the girl who is a victim of child abuse from her mom's alcoholic boyfriend. And with an incident that leads Jody no choice to leave the town. Beth pleads to Jody to just come out and tell the truth. But with a plan that is set becomes to change again to where Jody has to save Beth from drowning who is stuck underneath a rock and a tide that's fast approaching. It's a race between time for Jody to stop thinking of herself and to go the extra mile for her friend. Jody does come through for Beth, but soon it is Beth who is to return the favor and show the towns people that Jody is not who they all think she is. With a stash of gold waiting to be found it's a race of finding that true friend who will go through that extra mile. And realizing that sometimes "Some Friendships are worth a fortune!!"

    I remember when I was 8 or 9, I saw this and recored it to video, I lost it and hadn't seen it since. I remembered about it last year and got it and I have to say some of it a bit cheesy but still really good. The story is really good and keeps you interested. It's not just about finding treasure, its about loyalty and caring for your best friend. Some really good history flash back scenes of Molly Morgan. The connection with the characters were excellent,it really gets you involved in the film. Its really good to see how Beth and Jody develop as they are together. Jody becomes very caring when Beth is in trouble. Also Beth becomes a lot more adventures like Jody. Anna Chlumpsky and Christina Riccy did very well for the parts of Beth and Jody. Also some other good acting performances. The only two actresses that weren't brilliant were the two girls that Beth met after first meeting Jody, they were average but not amazing. The direction was excellent by Kevin James Dobson, some really good long shots of scenery. There are some cheesy moments in the film, for example the beam of light that shines from the mountain and goes straight to Beth and Jody on the boat. These moments don't happen through out the whole film to ruin it. I really wished they changed the ending, I wont say it just encase you haven't watched it. Other than that its a really good family film, even I still think its really good. Its definitely a good film to watch with your family on a rainy day.

    As you other fans of this great movie know, the movie is on VHS and in fullscreen and, of course the VHS is long out of print. I know you,as well as I am waiting and waiting for Universal to finally release this beloved movie to DVD! I am lucky enough to have the VERY rare laserdisc of this wonderful movie and it is in widescreen. I just recently put it to DVD and you know, I cannot get enough of watching this wonderful movie!! I did a comparison of the VHS to the widescreen version and you would not believe how much picture information from the sides is missing on the VHS version!!! I have been truly enjoying the full beauty of the widescreen version as this version is just how the film makers wanted you to see this movie. Each day I find myself watching this movie. I put it onto DVD-R and the picture quality is very good! Laserdiscs were at the time they were made the top home theater thing and were expensive too. So now, since I have transfered the laserdisc to DVD I can enjoy the DVD over and over and it is so wonderful!!! The laserdisc of gold diggers the secret of bear mountain is a very rare laserdisc and, I am very happy I have it and, now have it on DVD-R. The laserdisc player I have is the type with all the bells and whistles and so, because of this, it assures that the picture quality coming from that laserdisc will make the best picture quality it can give when I put it to DVD-R. Anyways I just wanted to share all this with you because I am just on such a high about this movie and truly love this movie, and to me, its kinda like a cult movie and I know there are many others who adore this movie. I also love this movie because of Beth, she is so sweet and has an innocence about her and, no matter how many times I watch her, I cannot get enough of her. I hope when Universal finally does release this movie to DVD , that they make it a special edition and,even a director's cut because there was other scenes filmed but not used and, you see a few of these cut scenes in the trailer. So,all of us who truly love this movie, lets hope so much that Universal will release a super edition of this movie to DVD!! I hope you enjoyed my words and, thanks for reading them :)

There's not many movies like this come out today, it's a real joy to watch and in fact, I'm going to give my video of this to my younger cousin's as I'm sure they will enjoy this fantastic film. overall i believe the people behind this movie did a wounderful job and i fell it's one of a kind.

    This movie is a true gem! Two fine actresses who make a fine team: Christina Ricci(The Addams Family movies, Casper, and Now and Then) and Anna Chlumsky(Vada on "My Girl 1&2"). The year go back, and adventure is what everyone seeks. Instead of boys doing the seeking, it's the girls. Beth(Ricci) is a city girl who meets Jody(Chlumsky) rough and tumble tomboy who seek "lost treasure". The other girls don't trust Jody, but Beth pays no mind to them. Good call. They ride on a rickety boat, which Beth is at the helm, while Jody gets down to The Bee Gees' "You Should Dancin'" which I think is the best scene I ever enjoyed. Jody's stepfather is a bigger gold digger than the daughter, and Beth doesn't trust him at all. The sheriff who's a friend learns the hard way, that he's not all worth trusting. Letting his greed tear up the family, and the trust of everyone around him. The real fortune to me was the bond, and the trust Jody and Beth has formed. It was worth more than any amount of gold anyone would find. This movie is a steal, but the rewards of watching it is worth a fortune! Rating 5 stars!

    I absolutely love this movie it made me cry the first 5 times I watched it. I think this movie should get 20 stars out of 10, I have seen this movie so many times I have every single word of it memorized, this movie deals with so many issues we face today, and even though it was make in 1995 doesn't mean it's an old fogie movie that doesn't deserve the time of day, just trust me I have seen it enough times to know! lol. I think that if you are looking for a movie to sit down and watch and not want it to be over then you have found the right movie Gold Diggers can make you laugh, cry, and wonder what's going to happen next all at the same time! So if you have yet to see this wonderful movie don't pass it up, go see it now! PS, See this movie, you have to!

    Beth( Christina Ricci) and her mother Kate( Polly Draper) have just moved from L.A, to a small town where Kate's aunt used to live. Beth becomes friends with this girl Jody( Anna Chlumsky). Jody is wild, adventerous and the total opposite of Beth. But a lot of people are saying that Jody is a really bad influence and that she steals and that she has a lot of problems. Beth doesn't listen to those story's, she likes Jody no matter what people tell her. One day, the two of them head out to this Bear Mountain that supposedly still carries gold. But a accident happens to Beth and it is up to Jody to save her life. This is a wonderful movie, I enjoyed it a lot. Christina Ricci and Anna Chlumsky were great. I would give Gold Diggers:The Secret Of Bear Mountain 8.5/10

The friendship between the girls is right on, reminds me of being young! LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!! Will recommend it to family and friends, and even let them borrow the DVD I just ordered! I know there are family members who will enjoy it, especially since the whole family can watch it together. This is unusual to find one these days, even programs on regular TV surprise me with some of the language! My DVD will arrive on Wednesday, and I can't wait to watch it again. so many ups and downs in it, was so happy there was a very happy ending! I have four Grandchildren now, so nice to have a good, clean movie for them to watch.

    Before Christina Ricci was truly established as the screen's indie queen, it seems that she mostly starred in what were viewed as family movies. "Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain" is a prime example. It's one of those movies that seems really cool when you're young. My favorite part of the movie was the history of the woman associated with the cave. Otherwise, the movie isn't anything special (especially since 1995 also saw movies like "Smoke" and "Unstrung Heroes"). As for Anna Chlumsky, she also gravitated more towards serious roles as she aged. I'll give the movie that. Also starring Polly Draper, Diana Scarwid (Christina in "Mommie Dearest") and David Keith (Drew Barrymore's father in "Firestarter").

    I have grown to love this film and who have seen this film a zillion times. This movie is based on what friendship really means. The film takes place back in 1980 where Beth Easton(played by Christina Ricci) moves to a small town up north with her mother. There she meets the towns "trouble maker" Jody Salerno(played by Anna Chlumsky) who is right at home in the woods surrounding her. Eventually Beth finds out from the towns people that Jody is impossible to become friends and to not be trusted. Beth somehow sees behind this and how she could be the link to finding adventure. Together they discover a legendary women who possibly hid gold in a cave called Bear Mountain. With there friendship growing more as they trace the steps in finding the gold there becomes a set back. Jody who is symbolized as the bad girl in town is revealed as the girl who is a victim of child abuse from her mom's alcoholic boyfriend. And with an incident that leads Jody no choice to leave the town. Beth pleads to Jody to just come out and tell the truth. But with a plan that is set becomes to change again to where Jody has to save Beth from drowning who is stuck underneath a rock and a tide that's fast approaching. It's a race between time for Jody to stop thinking of herself and to go the extra mile for her friend. Jody does come through for Beth, but soon it is Beth who is to return the favor and show the towns people that Jody is not who they all think she is. With a stash of gold waiting to be found it's a race of finding that true friend who will go through that extra mile. And realizing that sometimes "Some Friendships are worth a fortune!!"

    I remember when I was 8 or 9, I saw this and recored it to video, I lost it and hadn't seen it since. I remembered about it last year and got it and I have to say some of it a bit cheesy but still really good. The story is really good and keeps you interested. It's not just about finding treasure, its about loyalty and caring for your best friend. Some really good history flash back scenes of Molly Morgan. The connection with the characters were excellent,it really gets you involved in the film. Its really good to see how Beth and Jody develop as they are together. Jody becomes very caring when Beth is in trouble. Also Beth becomes a lot more adventures like Jody. Anna Chlumpsky and Christina Riccy did very well for the parts of Beth and Jody. Also some other good acting performances. The only two actresses that weren't brilliant were the two girls that Beth met after first meeting Jody, they were average but not amazing. The direction was excellent by Kevin James Dobson, some really good long shots of scenery. There are some cheesy moments in the film, for example the beam of light that shines from the mountain and goes straight to Beth and Jody on the boat. These moments don't happen through out the whole film to ruin it. I really wished they changed the ending, I wont say it just encase you haven't watched it. Other than that its a really good family film, even I still think its really good. Its definitely a good film to watch with your family on a rainy day.

    As you other fans of this great movie know, the movie is on VHS and in fullscreen and, of course the VHS is long out of print. I know you,as well as I am waiting and waiting for Universal to finally release this beloved movie to DVD! I am lucky enough to have the VERY rare laserdisc of this wonderful movie and it is in widescreen. I just recently put it to DVD and you know, I cannot get enough of watching this wonderful movie!! I did a comparison of the VHS to the widescreen version and you would not believe how much picture information from the sides is missing on the VHS version!!! I have been truly enjoying the full beauty of the widescreen version as this version is just how the film makers wanted you to see this movie. Each day I find myself watching this movie. I put it onto DVD-R and the picture quality is very good! Laserdiscs were at the time they were made the top home theater thing and were expensive too. So now, since I have transfered the laserdisc to DVD I can enjoy the DVD over and over and it is so wonderful!!! The laserdisc of gold diggers the secret of bear mountain is a very rare laserdisc and, I am very happy I have it and, now have it on DVD-R. The laserdisc player I have is the type with all the bells and whistles and so, because of this, it assures that the picture quality coming from that laserdisc will make the best picture quality it can give when I put it to DVD-R. Anyways I just wanted to share all this with you because I am just on such a high about this movie and truly love this movie, and to me, its kinda like a cult movie and I know there are many others who adore this movie. I also love this movie because of Beth, she is so sweet and has an innocence about her and, no matter how many times I watch her, I cannot get enough of her. I hope when Universal finally does release this movie to DVD , that they make it a special edition and,even a director's cut because there was other scenes filmed but not used and, you see a few of these cut scenes in the trailer. So,all of us who truly love this movie, lets hope so much that Universal will release a super edition of this movie to DVD!! I hope you enjoyed my words and, thanks for reading them :)

    I absolutely love this movie, it's fun, heartwarming and it's a great movie for all the family, the first time i come across this film on video, when it was on sale at my local video store, the first time as saw it i through it was pure brilliance and fabulous acting from talented people. it's adventurous and just the movie that every kid wants to watch. There's not many movies like this come out today, it's a real joy to watch and in fact, I'm going to give my video of this to my younger cousin's as I'm sure they will enjoy this fantastic film. overall i believe the people behind this movie did a wounderful job and i fell it's one of a kind.

    This movie is a true gem! Two fine actresses who make a fine team: Christina Ricci(The Addams Family movies, Casper, and Now and Then) and Anna Chlumsky(Vada on "My Girl 1&2"). The year go back, and adventure is what everyone seeks. Instead of boys doing the seeking, it's the girls. Beth(Ricci) is a city girl who meets Jody(Chlumsky) rough and tumble tomboy who seek "lost treasure". The other girls don't trust Jody, but Beth pays no mind to them. Good call. They ride on a rickety boat, which Beth is at the helm, while Jody gets down to The Bee Gees' "You Should Dancin'" which I think is the best scene I ever enjoyed. Jody's stepfather is a bigger gold digger than the daughter, and Beth doesn't trust him at all. The sheriff who's a friend learns the hard way, that he's not all worth trusting. Letting his greed tear up the family, and the trust of everyone around him. The real fortune to me was the bond, and the trust Jody and Beth has formed. It was worth more than any amount of gold anyone would find. This movie is a steal, but the rewards of watching it is worth a fortune! Rating 5 stars!

    I absolutely love this movie it made me cry the first 5 times I watched it. I think this movie should get 20 stars out of 10, I have seen this movie so many times I have every single word of it memorized, this movie deals with so many issues we face today, and even though it was make in 1995 doesn't mean it's an old fogie movie that doesn't deserve the time of day, just trust me I have seen it enough times to know! lol. I think that if you are looking for a movie to sit down and watch and not want it to be over then you have found the right movie Gold Diggers can make you laugh, cry, and wonder what's going to happen next all at the same time! So if you have yet to see this wonderful movie don't pass it up, go see it now! PS, See this movie, you have to!

    Beth( Christina Ricci) and her mother Kate( Polly Draper) have just moved from L.A, to a small town where Kate's aunt used to live. Beth becomes friends with this girl Jody( Anna Chlumsky). Jody is wild, adventerous and the total opposite of Beth. But a lot of people are saying that Jody is a really bad influence and that she steals and that she has a lot of problems. Beth doesn't listen to those story's, she likes Jody no matter what people tell her. One day, the two of them head out to this Bear Mountain that supposedly still carries gold. But a accident happens to Beth and it is up to Jody to save her life. This is a wonderful movie, I enjoyed it a lot. Christina Ricci and Anna Chlumsky were great. I would give Gold Diggers:The Secret Of Bear Mountain 8.5/10

    Christina Ricci is great as Elizabeth in this intelligent adventure flick. The supporting cast is brilliant. The costumes are simple. One of the good farces in the genre, Gold Diggers: Secret Of Bear Mountain will sparkle golden bears in the viewer's eye. 10 out of 10.
