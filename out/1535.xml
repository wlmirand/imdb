    French New Wave director, actor, producer and screenwriter Claude Chabrol's forty-fifth feature film which he wrote, is an adaptation of a screenplay written by French screenwriter, producer and director Henri-Georges Clouzot (1907-1977) who suffered a heart attack during the making of the film in 1964 which led to the production being stopped. Claude Chabrol's film was shot on various locations in Southern France and was produced by French director and producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Paul Prieur, a successful hotel manager who lives an idyllic life with his wife Nelly and their young son Vincent at a lakeside hotel in France. Paul and Nelly have been married for seven years and are happy together, but Paul's job is wearing him out and he begins to become suspicious about things. These sudden suspicions gradually increases and when Paul suspects his wife of having an affair, his personality alters and threatens both his own and Nelly's life. This visually ardent and character-driven French production draws a pervasive study of character about a seemingly happy man who one warm summer when suddenly struck by jealousy, descends into a state of madness and loses his grip on reality. Claude Chabrol's riveting and well-paced internal voyage goes far into the excruciating and nightmarish mind of the protagonist and the persistent suspense in this clinical psychological thriller which examines themes such as marriage, jealousy and mental illness, is reinforced by his precise and acute directing, the rigorous narrative structure and the efficient editing by Claude Chabrol's frequent collaborator Monique Fardoulis. The score by his longtime collaborator and son Matthieu Chabrol emphasizes the significant atmosphere in this luminous drama which is impelled by Francois Cluzet's multifaceted acting performance in a complicated role and a good acting performance by Emmanuelle B&eacute;art.

    The owner of the Hotel Du Lac, Paul Prieur (Fran&ccedil;ois Cluzet), gets married with the beautiful and sexy Nelly (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) and they have a boy. Nelly loves Paul and is pleasant with guests, and the insecure Paul feels that she is a woman out of his league. When Nelly spends some time with the handsome guest Martineau (Marc Lavoine), Paul follows her and becomes paranoid and delusional believing that she is unfaithful to him. His increasing obsession turns into madness that ends in an announced tragedy. "L'Enfer" is a dramatic tale of insecurity, paranoia and madness by Claude Chabrol, with the story of a man that lives in hell with his jealousy and brings this hell to the life of his wife. Last time that I had seen this film was on 23 April 2000 and the story is timeless and has not aged. The tragic conclusion is predictable and my only remark is the attitude of Doctor Arnoux, who should have foreseen that the safety of Nelly was in danger with the insane Paul. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is wonderfully cast to justify the obsession of Paul. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Ci&uacute;me - O Inferno do Amor Possessivo" ("Jealousy  The Hell of the Possessive Love")

    Not a pleasant film to watch, and it does get a little repetitive by the end, but still a masterful psychological thriller that attempts, and largely succeeds at, the not so easy task of entering into a man's brain and showing us how it operates: how he confuses fantasy with reality, how in brief moments of mental clarity he can realize what's happening to him but he is unable to control it, etc. For Claude Chabrol, the essence of insane jealousy seems to be that you stop seeing your partner as a person and you start seeing them as your property. The movie visually progresses according to the story: open, sunny and idyllic at the start, dark, stormy and claustrophobic at the end. Both Cluzet and Beart give career-defining performances. See "L'Enfer" when you're in the mood for something more than simple "entertainment". *** out of 4.

    If this film represents a faithful adherence to Clouzot's original script, one would have to say that the story may be regarded as the absolute apex/exemplar of Clouzot's understanding of psychology. At the same time, L'Enfer is absolutely a Claude Chabrol film, and the fact that it rests comfortably in either canon attests to the lasting parallels between the two masters. As with all of Chabrol's foremost creations, this is incisive social commentary masquerading under the banal tag of "psychological thriller". Though the film can be enjoyed without any deeper engagement with or meditation on its themes of Othello-esquire obsession/jealousy, I think some thought will reveal it to be a far more rewarding film than a superficial viewing might suggest. Situating/contextualizing the film in Chabrol's vast corpus of work, one finds in "L'Enfer" another nightmarish journey into the hazards of bourgeois sterility. Though one might say that the work is naturalistic in some respects (the intense violence that simmers beneath the genteel exterior is revealed in his disdainful disparagement of the neighboring competition), that the overreaching, emotionally volatile and profoundly sensitive husband is particularly prone to this type of neurosis, the telling proclamation of "sans fin" that closes the film suggests that the narrative is not one of isolated particulars, but a general affliction, a self-perpetuating tragedy engendered by flawed social mechanisms. Throughout his career, Chabrol has been especially critical of the life-denying entropy and suffocating claustrophobia of bourgeois marriage, a plight where the insatiably voracious woman feels her haplessness and subordination most acutely. This, in some respects, might be his finest evaluation of marriage and erotic love in general. The tensions explored throughout the film are far from novel, again we bear witness to the irresolvable Romantic preoccupation, the desire to possess and identify with a subjective other. Again, as with "Les Bonnes Femmes", we see the carnivorous, destructive male principle, eager to subdue, asphyxiate, smother and ultimately devour irrepressible femininity. Yet lest we distance ourselves from Paul's evident psychosis, Chabrol implicates marriage as an institution endorsed by society at large. Note Paul's perverse, masochistic pleasure in fabricating these outlandish fantasies, particularly the wild reverie of Emanuelle Beart entertaining the entire hotel in the attic. Is this the only way to preserve erotic love in the nauseating ennui of marriage, to continually reinvent the Other and, through wild imaginings, make him/her a stranger so as to escape the concreteness of conjugal reality? On another level, the film might be read as an Adlerian representation of modern neurosis, of a nervous man who is inadequately equipped for the rigours of social expectation, whose overreaching demand for absolute order and unity invariably drive him to dementia and a flight from reality. Chimeras of success and masculine authority elude him, undermined by personal insecurities and a willful, independent wife. How then, does he compensate for his lack of control? Refuge in the sadistic alternate reality that he manufactures throughout the movie. Technically, this movie is almost immaculate, featuring outstanding performances (Emmanuelle Beart is a force of nature) and repeated viewings affirm that it is a movie of great understanding. I'm not sure if this review made any sort of sense at all, but at the end of the day all I can do is urge you to immerse yourself in "L'Enfer".

    Why would a woman stay with a man who is trying to kill her? Why would she even spend the night with a crazy man, when the hospital is coming to take him to the loony bin the next morning? There's too much deaux ex machina stuff going on here. But the writers did foresee this objection: they made her kinda simple, a hip-swinging flirt, oblivious to the effect she has on other men and her increasingly more jealous husband. She even keeps it up when she finds out about his jealous, but in her stupidity, she thinks it means he truly loves her. There has been another French movie on this same subject, with the husband becoming increasingly more jealous. As much as I love these Frenchies, with their afternoon delights, I find it weird that the French MEN would make 2 great movies about a French MAN becoming jealous. If it's so well accepted, why this? Maybe there's a lot of suppression going on. And here's another point well made: financial problems can drive you crazy. He was not having a lot of business, and his insanity causes him to drive even more away as he rages in full hearing of his guests....and later, full sight. Too bad we're not allowed any insight into the origins of his craziness. Those voices don't just come in out of the blue. The woman, Emmanuelle, was truly beautiful and would have had to have been in order to carry this movie off. His insanity did have some realistic triggers: men DID covet her, and she sure didn't try to hide her charms. Reminded me of Raquel Welch wearing her skin tight red t-shirt in "Mother, Jugs and Speed", then upbraiding the drivers for calling her 'Jugs'. A wee bit inconsistent, hypocritical of the characters in both movies. The male actor was superior in showing all the nuances of jealousy on his face, running desperately to parallel his wife's water-skiing escapade on the back of the Lothario's boat and finding her getting back on the boat after putting on her shoes. If I know my husband is jealous, I"m not going to further inflame him by going off with a guy like this. Again, she was kinda dumb and childish but that could have been made a bit more obvious. Like the ending. No one knows what really happened. Time for a sequel. This movie was just shown at the MFA in Boston. It calls for a re-run, but having been jealous myself, it's rather painful to watch.

    Chabrol will always be Chabrol - sometimes less, rarely if ever more (maybe in La Femme Infidele...). But he's Chabrol, God bless him: love, lakes, bourgeoisie, jealousy, sex, meals, bonhomie, kids who appear and disappear, murderous thoughts, weird surrealism right before the end. You can set your watch by him. Emmanuel Beart is unbelievably sexy. And the film is a perfect illustration of some (dimly understood by me) Lacanian theories: sexual intercourse's dream of fusion is impossible, for example. Having possessed the ideal object, Cluzet knows that, in fact, one possesses nothing. Everything that makes Beart alluring also makes her dangerous in that she freely chooses...whatever she freely chooses. Freely choosing fidelity means that any moment you can freely choose infidelity. So a guy just can't win. That's why DeCordova in Bunuel's El (adroitly cited by another one of the readers here) pulls out the needle and thread. This film has none of the humor and acuity of Bunuel's neglected masterpiece. But it's Chabrol, and he's doing his thing. That ain't nothing...As a study of a man's descent from jealousy into madness, however, the film is powerful and well made but not super subtle.

    Surprisingly good, in fact rather splendid late Chabrol. We start with a young couple full of love and optimism as they bounce about running their hotel, bringing up baby and making eyes at each other. The wife seems to naturally do this semi flirting semi friendly stuff with everyone and gradually her husband begins to become jealous. We are never 100% certain but what at first seems six of one and half a dozen of the other descends into the 'hell' of the title as the green eyed monster truly comes to fruition. Initially delightful, this movie gets as dark as it possibly could and we are gripped, even perhaps more than with a Hitchcock as the terrible finale awaits.

    I just finished watching the stunning film L'Enfer and I couldn't wait to review it. The movie was written by one of my favorite French writers, Clouzot, so it was bound to be a good movie. Well, not exactly. In fact it was not just good but exceptional and is one of the better films I have seen in some time. With my background as a psychotherapist, I have to say that it was a brilliant psychological study of madness. All too often, films don't get it right--here, it's perfect. The story is about a jealous husband. At first, he shows signs of anxiety--trouble sleeping, irritability and distractability. Later, this slowly evolves to include paranoia, as he begins to suspect his lovely wife of infidelity. Well, at this point it MIGHT be that the husband is mildly mentally ill or perhaps he just has a very active imagination. However, very slowly the paranoia becomes more and more delusional and it's obvious this is no mild illness. In fact, it becomes increasingly obvious he is exhibiting strong symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. However, his wife refuses to believe--thinking instead that he is just a jerk and not potentially dangerous. However, he ultimately becomes violent and accusatory--and the violence continues to escalate. So far, this is a magnificent portrait of mental illness, as this SLOWLY developed and evolved. Unfortunately, one inexplicable part of the movie keeps it from getting a score of 10. When he ultimately beats and rapes her, she goes to the doctor. When the husband is confronted by the doctor, the husband VERY QUICKLY and CONVINCINGLY decompensates. It is obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than 14 that he is VERY dangerous and MUST be hospitalized as soon as possible to protect himself and others. BUT, the doctor sends them home--to come back in the morning!!! While it is VERY clever of the doctor to convince the paranoid husband the it is the wife who will be hospitalized, I can't imagine any doctor not calling for an immediate ambulance or the police to apprehend and forcibly commit him. Despite this flaw, what happens next and the absolute uncertainty of the ending is remarkable--you really aren't sure exactly what happened because it is all shown through the eyes of the husband and his own reality ultimately disintegrates and he is uncertain exactly what has occurred. This blending of paranoid schizophrenia with signs of disorganized schizophrenia was brilliant, as some people diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia later become MUCH more more fragmented and irrational. A WONDERFUL JOB BY THE WRITER, DIRECTOR and the MARVELOUS ACTOR PLAYING THE TROUBLED HUSBAND--WOW, what a great and convincing job! Too bad there was that little slip-up with the way the doctor behaved.

    Paul, an owner of a lakeside hotel and his naturally flirtatious and beautiful wife, Nelly seems to have it all, yet beneath the rosy facade there lurks a rotting jealousy, eating away inside Paul's unbalanced mind. This is the basic premise of Claude Chabrol's adaptation of Henri-Georges Clouzot 1964 script. The film hinges on two interrelated questions. Was Nell really unfaithful with many men, or was it all in Paul's unbalanced mind? Chabrol projects these anxieties from Paul's point of view,leaving the viewer to judge if there is any substance to Paul's jealousy. The film is compelling and the acting is excellent, but we never know the real, underlying cause of Paul's frightening descent to madness because Charbol complacently skips through the early years of their marriage within the first six minutes. yet all of the sudden Paul is talking with an inner voice in his head, out of nowhere. This was one of the film's biggest weaknesses and perhaps Clouzot's original story was not "psychological" enough for Chabrol to work through in his usual, thorough fashion.Moreover, we also never know if Nelly really was unfaithful, thus compounding the ambiguity of Paul's jealousy. Sometimes the direction is deliberately vague in projecting Paul's point of view, blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy. Moreover, the 1960s feel of the script is retained by Chabrol in his modern-day remaking of the values of that era in the early 1990s. as a result, L'enfer is strangely old-fashioned in its portrayal of women and men. The sets and costumes feel anachronistic, esp Nelly and her flirty friend. Only Paul and his doctor seem to exist in the early 1990s. The open-ended existentialist non-ending,was the only way out for Chabrol and Cluzot, but perhaps by negating the climax, Chabrol did himself a disservice in not resolving the film's many ambiguities. But perhaps that's what Clouzot's intention was. All in all, the film is a celluloid embodiment of Satrte's famous line "Hell is other people".

    As one of the originators of the New Wave, Claude Chabrol deserves a large amount of respect. His films such as Bon Femmes and Le Ceremonie put him in the high ranks of the best film makers, but in this case, L'Enfer, he does not match up to his own high standards. This could also just be my opinion since I didn't enjoy watching the downward spiral the characters go through. It was a ride I would rather not taken. Be that as it may, the film lacked a fullness of motivation for its lead, whose insanity seems to come from nowhere. Maybe again it is due to his mental illness, but as a viewer of the scene I needs to to know why. As France's Hitchcock, Chabrol needs to let us put the pieces together, as he let us do in his film The Unfaithful Wife, as we see the literal pieces of a puzzle reflecting the clues to the crime. If you love Emmanuel B'eart as we all do, you will find her and her fellow actors in good form, but the story falls flat.

A wee bit inconsistent, hypocritical of the characters in both movies. The male actor was superior in showing all the nuances of jealousy on his face, running desperately to parallel his wife's water-skiing escapade on the back of the Lothario's boat and finding her getting back on the boat after putting on her shoes. If I know my husband is jealous, I"m not going to further inflame him by going off with a guy like this. Again, she was kinda dumb and childish but that could have been made a bit more obvious. Like the ending. No one knows what really happened. Time for a sequel. This movie was just shown at the MFA in Boston. It calls for a re-run, but having been jealous myself, it's rather painful to watch.

    Chabrol will always be Chabrol - sometimes less, rarely if ever more (maybe in La Femme Infidele...). But he's Chabrol, God bless him: love, lakes, bourgeoisie, jealousy, sex, meals, bonhomie, kids who appear and disappear, murderous thoughts, weird surrealism right before the end. You can set your watch by him. Emmanuel Beart is unbelievably sexy. And the film is a perfect illustration of some (dimly understood by me) Lacanian theories: sexual intercourse's dream of fusion is impossible, for example. Having possessed the ideal object, Cluzet knows that, in fact, one possesses nothing. Everything that makes Beart alluring also makes her dangerous in that she freely chooses...whatever she freely chooses. Freely choosing fidelity means that any moment you can freely choose infidelity. So a guy just can't win. That's why DeCordova in Bunuel's El (adroitly cited by another one of the readers here) pulls out the needle and thread. This film has none of the humor and acuity of Bunuel's neglected masterpiece. But it's Chabrol, and he's doing his thing. That ain't nothing...As a study of a man's descent from jealousy into madness, however, the film is powerful and well made but not super subtle.

    Surprisingly good, in fact rather splendid late Chabrol. We start with a young couple full of love and optimism as they bounce about running their hotel, bringing up baby and making eyes at each other. The wife seems to naturally do this semi flirting semi friendly stuff with everyone and gradually her husband begins to become jealous. We are never 100% certain but what at first seems six of one and half a dozen of the other descends into the 'hell' of the title as the green eyed monster truly comes to fruition. Initially delightful, this movie gets as dark as it possibly could and we are gripped, even perhaps more than with a Hitchcock as the terrible finale awaits.

    I just finished watching the stunning film L'Enfer and I couldn't wait to review it. The movie was written by one of my favorite French writers, Clouzot, so it was bound to be a good movie. Well, not exactly. In fact it was not just good but exceptional and is one of the better films I have seen in some time. With my background as a psychotherapist, I have to say that it was a brilliant psychological study of madness. All too often, films don't get it right--here, it's perfect. The story is about a jealous husband. At first, he shows signs of anxiety--trouble sleeping, irritability and distractability. Later, this slowly evolves to include paranoia, as he begins to suspect his lovely wife of infidelity. Well, at this point it MIGHT be that the husband is mildly mentally ill or perhaps he just has a very active imagination. However, very slowly the paranoia becomes more and more delusional and it's obvious this is no mild illness. In fact, it becomes increasingly obvious he is exhibiting strong symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. However, his wife refuses to believe--thinking instead that he is just a jerk and not potentially dangerous. However, he ultimately becomes violent and accusatory--and the violence continues to escalate. So far, this is a magnificent portrait of mental illness, as this SLOWLY developed and evolved. Unfortunately, one inexplicable part of the movie keeps it from getting a score of 10. When he ultimately beats and rapes her, she goes to the doctor. When the husband is confronted by the doctor, the husband VERY QUICKLY and CONVINCINGLY decompensates. It is obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than 14 that he is VERY dangerous and MUST be hospitalized as soon as possible to protect himself and others. BUT, the doctor sends them home--to come back in the morning!!! While it is VERY clever of the doctor to convince the paranoid husband the it is the wife who will be hospitalized, I can't imagine any doctor not calling for an immediate ambulance or the police to apprehend and forcibly commit him. Despite this flaw, what happens next and the absolute uncertainty of the ending is remarkable--you really aren't sure exactly what happened because it is all shown through the eyes of the husband and his own reality ultimately disintegrates and he is uncertain exactly what has occurred. This blending of paranoid schizophrenia with signs of disorganized schizophrenia was brilliant, as some people diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia later become MUCH more more fragmented and irrational. A WONDERFUL JOB BY THE WRITER, DIRECTOR and the MARVELOUS ACTOR PLAYING THE TROUBLED HUSBAND--WOW, what a great and convincing job! Too bad there was that little slip-up with the way the doctor behaved.

    Paul, an owner of a lakeside hotel and his naturally flirtatious and beautiful wife, Nelly seems to have it all, yet beneath the rosy facade there lurks a rotting jealousy, eating away inside Paul's unbalanced mind. This is the basic premise of Claude Chabrol's adaptation of Henri-Georges Clouzot 1964 script. The film hinges on two interrelated questions. Was Nell really unfaithful with many men, or was it all in Paul's unbalanced mind? Chabrol projects these anxieties from Paul's point of view,leaving the viewer to judge if there is any substance to Paul's jealousy. The film is compelling and the acting is excellent, but we never know the real, underlying cause of Paul's frightening descent to madness because Charbol complacently skips through the early years of their marriage within the first six minutes. yet all of the sudden Paul is talking with an inner voice in his head, out of nowhere. This was one of the film's biggest weaknesses and perhaps Clouzot's original story was not "psychological" enough for Chabrol to work through in his usual, thorough fashion.Moreover, we also never know if Nelly really was unfaithful, thus compounding the ambiguity of Paul's jealousy. Sometimes the direction is deliberately vague in projecting Paul's point of view, blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy. Moreover, the 1960s feel of the script is retained by Chabrol in his modern-day remaking of the values of that era in the early 1990s. as a result, L'enfer is strangely old-fashioned in its portrayal of women and men. The sets and costumes feel anachronistic, esp Nelly and her flirty friend. Only Paul and his doctor seem to exist in the early 1990s. The open-ended existentialist non-ending,was the only way out for Chabrol and Cluzot, but perhaps by negating the climax, Chabrol did himself a disservice in not resolving the film's many ambiguities. But perhaps that's what Clouzot's intention was. All in all, the film is a celluloid embodiment of Satrte's famous line "Hell is other people".

    As one of the originators of the New Wave, Claude Chabrol deserves a large amount of respect. His films such as Bon Femmes and Le Ceremonie put him in the high ranks of the best film makers, but in this case, L'Enfer, he does not match up to his own high standards. This could also just be my opinion since I didn't enjoy watching the downward spiral the characters go through. It was a ride I would rather not taken. Be that as it may, the film lacked a fullness of motivation for its lead, whose insanity seems to come from nowhere. Maybe again it is due to his mental illness, but as a viewer of the scene I needs to to know why. As France's Hitchcock, Chabrol needs to let us put the pieces together, as he let us do in his film The Unfaithful Wife, as we see the literal pieces of a puzzle reflecting the clues to the crime. If you love Emmanuel B'eart as we all do, you will find her and her fellow actors in good form, but the story falls flat.

    French New Wave director, actor, producer and screenwriter Claude Chabrol's forty-fifth feature film which he wrote, is an adaptation of a screenplay written by French screenwriter, producer and director Henri-Georges Clouzot (1907-1977) who suffered a heart attack during the making of the film in 1964 which led to the production being stopped. Claude Chabrol's film was shot on various locations in Southern France and was produced by French director and producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Paul Prieur, a successful hotel manager who lives an idyllic life with his wife Nelly and their young son Vincent at a lakeside hotel in France. Paul and Nelly have been married for seven years and are happy together, but Paul's job is wearing him out and he begins to become suspicious about things. These sudden suspicions gradually increases and when Paul suspects his wife of having an affair, his personality alters and threatens both his own and Nelly's life. This visually ardent and character-driven French production draws a pervasive study of character about a seemingly happy man who one warm summer when suddenly struck by jealousy, descends into a state of madness and loses his grip on reality. Claude Chabrol's riveting and well-paced internal voyage goes far into the excruciating and nightmarish mind of the protagonist and the persistent suspense in this clinical psychological thriller which examines themes such as marriage, jealousy and mental illness, is reinforced by his precise and acute directing, the rigorous narrative structure and the efficient editing by Claude Chabrol's frequent collaborator Monique Fardoulis. The score by his longtime collaborator and son Matthieu Chabrol emphasizes the significant atmosphere in this luminous drama which is impelled by Francois Cluzet's multifaceted acting performance in a complicated role and a good acting performance by Emmanuelle B&eacute;art.

    The owner of the Hotel Du Lac, Paul Prieur (Fran&ccedil;ois Cluzet), gets married with the beautiful and sexy Nelly (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) and they have a boy. Nelly loves Paul and is pleasant with guests, and the insecure Paul feels that she is a woman out of his league. When Nelly spends some time with the handsome guest Martineau (Marc Lavoine), Paul follows her and becomes paranoid and delusional believing that she is unfaithful to him. His increasing obsession turns into madness that ends in an announced tragedy. "L'Enfer" is a dramatic tale of insecurity, paranoia and madness by Claude Chabrol, with the story of a man that lives in hell with his jealousy and brings this hell to the life of his wife. Last time that I had seen this film was on 23 April 2000 and the story is timeless and has not aged. The tragic conclusion is predictable and my only remark is the attitude of Doctor Arnoux, who should have foreseen that the safety of Nelly was in danger with the insane Paul. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is wonderfully cast to justify the obsession of Paul. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Ci&uacute;me - O Inferno do Amor Possessivo" ("Jealousy  The Hell of the Possessive Love")

    Not a pleasant film to watch, and it does get a little repetitive by the end, but still a masterful psychological thriller that attempts, and largely succeeds at, the not so easy task of entering into a man's brain and showing us how it operates: how he confuses fantasy with reality, how in brief moments of mental clarity he can realize what's happening to him but he is unable to control it, etc. For Claude Chabrol, the essence of insane jealousy seems to be that you stop seeing your partner as a person and you start seeing them as your property. The movie visually progresses according to the story: open, sunny and idyllic at the start, dark, stormy and claustrophobic at the end. Both Cluzet and Beart give career-defining performances. See "L'Enfer" when you're in the mood for something more than simple "entertainment". *** out of 4.

    If this film represents a faithful adherence to Clouzot's original script, one would have to say that the story may be regarded as the absolute apex/exemplar of Clouzot's understanding of psychology. At the same time, L'Enfer is absolutely a Claude Chabrol film, and the fact that it rests comfortably in either canon attests to the lasting parallels between the two masters. As with all of Chabrol's foremost creations, this is incisive social commentary masquerading under the banal tag of "psychological thriller". Though the film can be enjoyed without any deeper engagement with or meditation on its themes of Othello-esquire obsession/jealousy, I think some thought will reveal it to be a far more rewarding film than a superficial viewing might suggest. Situating/contextualizing the film in Chabrol's vast corpus of work, one finds in "L'Enfer" another nightmarish journey into the hazards of bourgeois sterility. Though one might say that the work is naturalistic in some respects (the intense violence that simmers beneath the genteel exterior is revealed in his disdainful disparagement of the neighboring competition), that the overreaching, emotionally volatile and profoundly sensitive husband is particularly prone to this type of neurosis, the telling proclamation of "sans fin" that closes the film suggests that the narrative is not one of isolated particulars, but a general affliction, a self-perpetuating tragedy engendered by flawed social mechanisms. Throughout his career, Chabrol has been especially critical of the life-denying entropy and suffocating claustrophobia of bourgeois marriage, a plight where the insatiably voracious woman feels her haplessness and subordination most acutely. This, in some respects, might be his finest evaluation of marriage and erotic love in general. The tensions explored throughout the film are far from novel, again we bear witness to the irresolvable Romantic preoccupation, the desire to possess and identify with a subjective other. Again, as with "Les Bonnes Femmes", we see the carnivorous, destructive male principle, eager to subdue, asphyxiate, smother and ultimately devour irrepressible femininity. Yet lest we distance ourselves from Paul's evident psychosis, Chabrol implicates marriage as an institution endorsed by society at large. Note Paul's perverse, masochistic pleasure in fabricating these outlandish fantasies, particularly the wild reverie of Emanuelle Beart entertaining the entire hotel in the attic. Is this the only way to preserve erotic love in the nauseating ennui of marriage, to continually reinvent the Other and, through wild imaginings, make him/her a stranger so as to escape the concreteness of conjugal reality? On another level, the film might be read as an Adlerian representation of modern neurosis, of a nervous man who is inadequately equipped for the rigours of social expectation, whose overreaching demand for absolute order and unity invariably drive him to dementia and a flight from reality. Chimeras of success and masculine authority elude him, undermined by personal insecurities and a willful, independent wife. How then, does he compensate for his lack of control? Refuge in the sadistic alternate reality that he manufactures throughout the movie. Technically, this movie is almost immaculate, featuring outstanding performances (Emmanuelle Beart is a force of nature) and repeated viewings affirm that it is a movie of great understanding. I'm not sure if this review made any sort of sense at all, but at the end of the day all I can do is urge you to immerse yourself in "L'Enfer".

    Why would a woman stay with a man who is trying to kill her? Why would she even spend the night with a crazy man, when the hospital is coming to take him to the loony bin the next morning? There's too much deaux ex machina stuff going on here. But the writers did foresee this objection: they made her kinda simple, a hip-swinging flirt, oblivious to the effect she has on other men and her increasingly more jealous husband. She even keeps it up when she finds out about his jealous, but in her stupidity, she thinks it means he truly loves her. There has been another French movie on this same subject, with the husband becoming increasingly more jealous. As much as I love these Frenchies, with their afternoon delights, I find it weird that the French MEN would make 2 great movies about a French MAN becoming jealous. If it's so well accepted, why this? Maybe there's a lot of suppression going on. And here's another point well made: financial problems can drive you crazy. He was not having a lot of business, and his insanity causes him to drive even more away as he rages in full hearing of his guests....and later, full sight. Too bad we're not allowed any insight into the origins of his craziness. Those voices don't just come in out of the blue. The woman, Emmanuelle, was truly beautiful and would have had to have been in order to carry this movie off. His insanity did have some realistic triggers: men DID covet her, and she sure didn't try to hide her charms. Reminded me of Raquel Welch wearing her skin tight red t-shirt in "Mother, Jugs and Speed", then upbraiding the drivers for calling her 'Jugs'. A wee bit inconsistent, hypocritical of the characters in both movies.
