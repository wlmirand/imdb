 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  May-Alice Culhane was a successful soap opera star, but a car accident has left her bound to a wheelchair. She returns to her now-empty family home in the bayous of Louisiana which she had eagerly left years before. She drinks heavily and vents her bitterness on the succession of nurses who are hired to take care of her and immediately quit because she is so unbearable. Chantelle is the latest of these nurses, and May-Alice is told that Chantelle is the last nurse she'll get. Chantelle for reasons of her own, is also in a position where she badly needs the job to work out. The movie focuses on how these two women become friends and help each other heal emotionally.

    "The Cajuns have always squeezed the passion fish, some swallow the passion fish, thinking hard of the one they want to be liked off." The successful soap star May-Alice Culhane is after a taxi accident a paraplegic, bound to her wheelchair. She returns to her childhood home in Louisiana. To cope with the sudden chock of the totally new situation (like this starts the movie, May-Alice not understanding where she is and what happened. Finally at home in her childhoods home she starts drinking and watching television as the only thing to do. For the ever changing help she is the unbearable 'bitch on wheels'. Until Chantelle enters the scene. We know all about the bitter, white mistress. What she was, what happened to her and how it is now for her. But Chantelle? Parts and bits of the black recovering cocaine addicts background emerges slowly in bits and pieces. When Lucas shows up. When her father with her daughter pays a visit. Her father is the legal guardian for her daughter: "as long I think it is necessary" he tells Chantelle, his daughter. The white mistress and her black servant seem to be far apart: white and black. Two different worlds. But not: they sit in the same boat (shown metaphoric when the movie ends. Chantelle: "We are stuck with each other" and answered by May-Alice: "For the time being." May-Alice is visited twice by her former work, hardly hiding their pity for May-Alice and her black servant. When nothing is left to hide behind the white bitterness and the black stubbornness the afford to pretend is with no meaning. The possibility emerges: not to recognize but to see the other. Each other. Both in need of help. Helping each other. With no-way-out-option. Instead pity: respect. They are assisted by Rennie, the childhood crush, the Cajun handyman (Chantelle mouthes silent to her: "He likes you." And Sugar LeDoux, the local cowboy with children around every corner. He seduces Chantelle with smiling charm and dances with her daughter at the local festivity. Watched by the critical eyes of Chantelles father. Does the cowboy want Chantelles heart he must behave. The womens forced-up respect transforms to friendship. Behind their private disaster as crippled successful soap star and the recovering cocaine addict eds last chance for a job. This job. Both on their way to accept again life. Mirroring each others needs. Both crippled: a white body and a black soul.

    Passion Fish, showcases its 2 principal characters' (May-Alice and Chantelle) hopefulness and hopelessness in a light which I had never realized previously. Where May-Alice relapses into a daze of misery and alcohol-induced mist of self-centeredness, Chantelle struggles alone towards her self-rehabilitation - two unlikely individuals who are connected at a very obvious level, by the conflict of their motivations for existence but at a deeper plane, related not by conflict but by identification of a shared identity. Named after a Cajun superstition about finding love, the movie opens with a close-up of May-Alice's eyes as she lays on a hospital bed, victim of a freak accident and now, very mean-tempered inheritor of a crippled body. Her soap acting rendered futile and raging at the seeming dithering uselessness of all hospice personnel in uniform (nurses, physical therapists, doctors, psychiatrists), May-Alice moves back to the family home by a Louisiana bayou in a clear attempt at drinking herself into oblivion. Bound to a wheelchair and perennially in front of the television with a wine bottle as an unshakeable appendage, she has an attendant nurse in the form of a feisty black nurse (Chantelle  who takes up this work for far more substantial reasons than what initially appear. May-Alice's curmudgeonly self-indulgence in wine and TV collide with the blunt denials and admonitions of Chantelle, with decidedly un-"nursey" approaches. This conflict of wills between two strong and set women lies at the heart of this film; a conflict which does not get manifested in typical conventionally hoarse and piquant scenes. What interested me immensely are the numerous tiny battles which emerge in the course of this war of wills  a tug here, a pull there followed by a push. Several times in the movie, I expected the dam of unresolved and unsatisfied emotions to burst into a torrent of screams and the inevitable firing of the nurse. It never came. Passion Fish intensely resists the easy transition of such a story into a likely tale of maudlin sentimentalism and spiritual upliftment. When I think of it, the movie is less of a motif for human tragedy or that of people who have suffered mentally or physically coming out of the ordeal as veritable angels. Then there is the Louisiana landscape and the comic portraits of an assortment of Alice-May's visitors, and a repressed but tender romance which materializes with an old acquaintance. To the back of the house, there are verdant and soothing wetlands teeming with herons, alligators and snakes while towards the front, the track which leads to it is dusty and decidedly un-photogenic with what I can only presume to be factories, pumping affluents into this seemingly serene lake. This two-tinged sepia is present everywhere in the movie. This many-layered portrayal of a story of two women is marked by engaging performances all-round and a screenplay which does not veer into the realm of the tear-jerker. One more thing, I love the "I didn't ask for the anal probe" monologue for its intensity and the sheer range of emotions it seeks to explore  from thrill to determination to anticipation to frustration to dismay and finally, resignation.

    "Passion Fish", directed and written by John Sayles, is a sturdy very good watch on the whole. I thought there was obviously a lot of thought that had gone into the lead characters plights and what each were struggling through. However, sometimes knit-picking isn't too fun but must be done, and there were 2 different things that brought the movie down from great to good. One was about a 5 minute diatribe that a side-character blathers about "anal-probes". My wife and I were sitting there watching and both looked at each other saying "wth was that", the editor completely asleep at the wheel. And secondly, the ending sort of fizzled. Correct these 2 inconsistencies, and I think the movie was an 8/10. Great job by leads McDownell and Woodard nonetheless, especially McDownell.

    A film about a woman struggling to live with herself after a life changing accident. She is paralyzed from the waist down and drinks by the hour. She goes through a slew of nurses at her Louisiana home until she finally comes to terms with one played by Alfre Woodard. The film is supported by strong character moments and superb dialog. Overall, it is a beautifully written and well crafted film. John Sayles does an amazing job directing, writing and editing. He extracts memorable performances from Mary McDonnell and Alfre Woodard, and never once shows an unnecessary scene or line. Look out for a supporting role from David Straithairn and the subtle yet poignant cinematography that drives the film to its end. (The Louisiana Bayous never looked so good!)

    Passion Fish (1992) I wish I could like John Sayles films more. They want to be so important and serious, about exceptional people in normal working America. Characters are dying to be felt for and understood, and the turns of events are poignant in simple ways we can relate to. So it is with Passion Fish, with a couple changes. For the first long part of the movie the main character, an ex-soap opera star recently made paraplegic, is completely unlikable. But eventually we come to appreciate her attitude, and other characters arrive, namely a nurse who can stick it out with her. So if all this sounds good, it is. But the writing is a little off, a little wrong, all the way through. Occasionally it's just a strain (I laughed out loud a couple times at it, not with it). There's not problem with the subjects and what they do, but what they say, a hair off key from what such real people would say. Or that's the sense you get. And the filming is adequate without being magical, or emphatic, or whatever it is that great movies pull off. The camera-work, the editing, the clunky addition of sounds, it's all a little crude, as if it didn't matter that it was just functional and used a few cheap devices (like a little montage sequence with snippets dissolving one into another like a sentimental ad). In fact, it has a television quality even though Sayles has never done t.v. as far as I know. If you are really into content, though, and real people with real problems, none of this will matter as much. And the compensations include gritty acting, which makes the most of the dialog. If this lack of style is your style, you'll like it. If you want formal intentions of any kind you might think it's slow and unartful.

    John Sayles directs "Passion Fish". The plot? Soap star May Alice (played by Mary McDonnell) is rendered a paraplegic after a freak automobile accident. She soon finds herself housebound and cared for by Chantelle, a live in nurse played by Alfre Woodard. Like most films in this genre  "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Driving Miss Daisy", "The Waterdance", "My Left Foot", "The Whales of August", "Persona", "Cries and Whispers", "The Defiant Ones" etc  "Passion Fish" revolves around shifting power relationships. Here, May is a wealthy but crippled white woman and Chantelle is (or seems to be) an impoverished black woman who nevertheless has the full use of her body. Each depends on the other. What Sayles does is trick us into making parallels between privilege, race and servitude  even though the film's power dynamics work perfectly well as a literal, social comment  only to then later reveal that Chantelle is herself a wealthy woman, with a father who is a doctor. Our double take, our need to reassess our typecasting, is mirrored to the very reappraisals our stars are forced to make throughout the film. And so May reverses her snobbish attitude toward her home town, blacks, her art and locals, whilst striking up a relationship with a man called Rennie (played by Sayles regular David Strathairn). In a similar fashion, Chantelle reassess her role as an assistant, a woman of servitude, and her own racial prejudices. Late in the film it is revealed that Chantelle is struggling to overcome a drug addiction. The film then draws broad parallels between both women's debilitations, the point being that struggles cross all divides and that recovery is made easier in a world in which we all hold hands. This aspect of the film  and Sayles' ending  is very hokey, very maudlin. But most films which deal with racial issues in such a manner risk a condescending, trite, self congratulatory tone. Sayles' filmography is littered with such naive, on-the-nose preaching. Better to tackle similar issues indirectly, invisibly, and at off kilter angles. Still, the film is packed with good stuff. On the outskirts of the film's worn-out melodrama are numerous beautifully subtle or unconventional scenes. Mary McDonnell's performance is itself interesting  watch how she lets her accent reassert itself at several key points  and the film's Louisiana's backdrops are suitably moody (Sayles aesthetic is amateurish, but his scripting makes up for this). The film's title is conjured up best during one scene in which an actress invests considerable time and energy into elevating a trashy movie scene about aliens administering anal probes. The point: don't violate yourself by seeking fulfilment in hollow, vile pursuits and don't turn your back to genuine passions. Case in point May, who eschews small town life in favour for what she now realises is a grubby movie world populated by ditsy idiots, and Chantelle, who likewise turns her back to the people she loved and grew up amidst. But doesn't Sayles' somewhat patronising view of "them big city folk" undermine the very message of his film? 7.9/10  Like most of Sayles' best films, the actual narrative framework is more intelligent than the film's content (see Sayles' "Limbo). The way the act of watching the film is interwoven with the way the character's themselves watch and transform is genius. The film's actual content, though, is pure Hollywood "big issue" cheese, typical of a Paul Haggis, Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kramer.

    A crippled TV soap opera star (Mary McDonnell) retreats, with undisguised bitterness, to her neglected childhood home in Louisiana, where she proceeds to make life hell for a series of nurses, until the arrival of Alfre Woodard. The balance of the movie follows McDonnell's slow emotional recovery and her reluctant friendship with Woodard, but despite the similarity to so many other Hollywood rehab dramas there isn't a wasted word or image, and not a clich&eacute; in sight. The film marks a return to the intimate scale of director John Sayles' earlier efforts, and it's a pleasure to finally see a mainstream American movie with the novelty of real characters speaking believable dialogue, written by a filmmaker with enough patience to allow his story to develop at a natural pace. The result is a leisurely but powerful drama, with more than its share of humor and with plenty of lively local Cajun culture. Trivia note: both McDonnell and Woodard were previously featured in Lawrence Kasdan's Yuppie wish-fulfillment fantasy 'The Grand Canyon' where, ironically, they never shared a single scene.

    Mary McDonnell had a brief spate of success in films in the early 1990s before disappearing from the scene and reemerging recently on the television series "Battlestar Galactica." First she came to major attention in "Dances with Wolves," for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and then she graduated to the lead category in 1992 for her performance in "Passion Fish." McDonnell gives a lovely performance as a bratty soap opera actress who's confined to a wheelchair after an accident, and who must rely on a no-nonsense nurse (Alfre Woodard, lovely as well) for help. The film follows all of the requisite trajectories you'd expect from a movie like this, and the fish that give the film its name serve a heavy-handed symbolic purpose that seemed too much for me even at the time (and I was only seventeen). But the film does have a relaxed indie vibe to it, and I can see why people like it. Grade: B+

    You can write the best scripts, pronounce their promise with great dialogues, but without direction, you will never extract lifelike realism, sensibility and made those qualities accessible in superb performance presented here. This movie has it all. One of the things I treasure the most and mind you, I know I keep repeating myself again and again - that be a great atmosphere. Atmosphere in this movie is ravishing. Locations are not overused for any other purpose but to remain the stage of this charming story. Relationship between May-Alice and Chantelle has relaxed and profound feeling about finer things of life. Shear simplicity of this approach is risky for mass audience, but for the connoisseur of finer realism, it is a pure joy. One thing is for certain: If you can't detect those virtues, you will at least fulfill your boredom early in the movie and look elsewhere. Preparation of actors is excellent from beginning toward the end. To tell you the truth, nitpicking wont do you any good here, because I really can't find anything wrong with this movie. I would simply, again and again, soak the lifelike presence of the main characters and enjoy this movie. My utmost respect goes to John Sayles for outstanding results with Passion Fish.

    This movie is about a soap star, who is barely middle-aged, yet finds here self permanently disabled. She returns to her childhood home in Louisiana's Bayou. The soap star is very credibly played. She is a pain-in-the-neck. She is mad at the World. She turns to alcohol as her way of coping. Any nurse's aides that come by find that she is impossible to deal with. Finally a black woman, played by Alfrey Woodard, comes by. She is unconventional. Unlike the other aides, she doesn't pretend to be the orderly. She is honesty and down-to-earth. She says that 'she can't leave. It is a job that she must have'. The 'must have' turns out to be due to the fact that she is really looking for a place of refuge from her destructive life up North. This movie is very original. It may be one of Sayles' best. The bayou is beautiful. The actors and actresses who play the locals are very convincing. I especially like the "prima donna" ladies who pretend to be sophisticated, but really are opinionated bigots. Of course, Sayles' regular shows up as a local fisherman. Straitharn plays a very believable cajun. I also like the way that the local blacks were portrayed. They were cajun blacks. They had their own style, but also were culturally similar to the local cajun whites. The cajun music, of course, was very good. The beau of Woodard's character was entertaining. He was a man of lots of experiences. He had a boyish charm, but also had a lot of responsibilities. He was very forward and positive thinking. This movie was very charming. It is strange that a movie about a pain-in-the neck wheelchair-bound woman, could actually be entertaining and positive. Somehow, Sayles accomplished this.

In fact, it has a television quality even though Sayles has never done t.v. as far as I know. If you are really into content, though, and real people with real problems, none of this will matter as much. And the compensations include gritty acting, which makes the most of the dialog. If this lack of style is your style, you'll like it. If you want formal intentions of any kind you might think it's slow and unartful.

    John Sayles directs "Passion Fish". The plot? Soap star May Alice (played by Mary McDonnell) is rendered a paraplegic after a freak automobile accident. She soon finds herself housebound and cared for by Chantelle, a live in nurse played by Alfre Woodard. Like most films in this genre  "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Driving Miss Daisy", "The Waterdance", "My Left Foot", "The Whales of August", "Persona", "Cries and Whispers", "The Defiant Ones" etc  "Passion Fish" revolves around shifting power relationships. Here, May is a wealthy but crippled white woman and Chantelle is (or seems to be) an impoverished black woman who nevertheless has the full use of her body. Each depends on the other. What Sayles does is trick us into making parallels between privilege, race and servitude  even though the film's power dynamics work perfectly well as a literal, social comment  only to then later reveal that Chantelle is herself a wealthy woman, with a father who is a doctor. Our double take, our need to reassess our typecasting, is mirrored to the very reappraisals our stars are forced to make throughout the film. And so May reverses her snobbish attitude toward her home town, blacks, her art and locals, whilst striking up a relationship with a man called Rennie (played by Sayles regular David Strathairn). In a similar fashion, Chantelle reassess her role as an assistant, a woman of servitude, and her own racial prejudices. Late in the film it is revealed that Chantelle is struggling to overcome a drug addiction. The film then draws broad parallels between both women's debilitations, the point being that struggles cross all divides and that recovery is made easier in a world in which we all hold hands. This aspect of the film  and Sayles' ending  is very hokey, very maudlin. But most films which deal with racial issues in such a manner risk a condescending, trite, self congratulatory tone. Sayles' filmography is littered with such naive, on-the-nose preaching. Better to tackle similar issues indirectly, invisibly, and at off kilter angles. Still, the film is packed with good stuff. On the outskirts of the film's worn-out melodrama are numerous beautifully subtle or unconventional scenes. Mary McDonnell's performance is itself interesting  watch how she lets her accent reassert itself at several key points  and the film's Louisiana's backdrops are suitably moody (Sayles aesthetic is amateurish, but his scripting makes up for this). The film's title is conjured up best during one scene in which an actress invests considerable time and energy into elevating a trashy movie scene about aliens administering anal probes. The point: don't violate yourself by seeking fulfilment in hollow, vile pursuits and don't turn your back to genuine passions. Case in point May, who eschews small town life in favour for what she now realises is a grubby movie world populated by ditsy idiots, and Chantelle, who likewise turns her back to the people she loved and grew up amidst. But doesn't Sayles' somewhat patronising view of "them big city folk" undermine the very message of his film? 7.9/10  Like most of Sayles' best films, the actual narrative framework is more intelligent than the film's content (see Sayles' "Limbo). The way the act of watching the film is interwoven with the way the character's themselves watch and transform is genius. The film's actual content, though, is pure Hollywood "big issue" cheese, typical of a Paul Haggis, Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kramer.

    A crippled TV soap opera star (Mary McDonnell) retreats, with undisguised bitterness, to her neglected childhood home in Louisiana, where she proceeds to make life hell for a series of nurses, until the arrival of Alfre Woodard. The balance of the movie follows McDonnell's slow emotional recovery and her reluctant friendship with Woodard, but despite the similarity to so many other Hollywood rehab dramas there isn't a wasted word or image, and not a clich&eacute; in sight. The film marks a return to the intimate scale of director John Sayles' earlier efforts, and it's a pleasure to finally see a mainstream American movie with the novelty of real characters speaking believable dialogue, written by a filmmaker with enough patience to allow his story to develop at a natural pace. The result is a leisurely but powerful drama, with more than its share of humor and with plenty of lively local Cajun culture. Trivia note: both McDonnell and Woodard were previously featured in Lawrence Kasdan's Yuppie wish-fulfillment fantasy 'The Grand Canyon' where, ironically, they never shared a single scene.

    Mary McDonnell had a brief spate of success in films in the early 1990s before disappearing from the scene and reemerging recently on the television series "Battlestar Galactica." First she came to major attention in "Dances with Wolves," for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and then she graduated to the lead category in 1992 for her performance in "Passion Fish." McDonnell gives a lovely performance as a bratty soap opera actress who's confined to a wheelchair after an accident, and who must rely on a no-nonsense nurse (Alfre Woodard, lovely as well) for help. The film follows all of the requisite trajectories you'd expect from a movie like this, and the fish that give the film its name serve a heavy-handed symbolic purpose that seemed too much for me even at the time (and I was only seventeen). But the film does have a relaxed indie vibe to it, and I can see why people like it. Grade: B+

    You can write the best scripts, pronounce their promise with great dialogues, but without direction, you will never extract lifelike realism, sensibility and made those qualities accessible in superb performance presented here. This movie has it all. One of the things I treasure the most and mind you, I know I keep repeating myself again and again - that be a great atmosphere. Atmosphere in this movie is ravishing. Locations are not overused for any other purpose but to remain the stage of this charming story. Relationship between May-Alice and Chantelle has relaxed and profound feeling about finer things of life. Shear simplicity of this approach is risky for mass audience, but for the connoisseur of finer realism, it is a pure joy. One thing is for certain: If you can't detect those virtues, you will at least fulfill your boredom early in the movie and look elsewhere. Preparation of actors is excellent from beginning toward the end. To tell you the truth, nitpicking wont do you any good here, because I really can't find anything wrong with this movie. I would simply, again and again, soak the lifelike presence of the main characters and enjoy this movie. My utmost respect goes to John Sayles for outstanding results with Passion Fish.

    This movie is about a soap star, who is barely middle-aged, yet finds here self permanently disabled. She returns to her childhood home in Louisiana's Bayou. The soap star is very credibly played. She is a pain-in-the-neck. She is mad at the World. She turns to alcohol as her way of coping. Any nurse's aides that come by find that she is impossible to deal with. Finally a black woman, played by Alfrey Woodard, comes by. She is unconventional. Unlike the other aides, she doesn't pretend to be the orderly. She is honesty and down-to-earth. She says that 'she can't leave. It is a job that she must have'. The 'must have' turns out to be due to the fact that she is really looking for a place of refuge from her destructive life up North. This movie is very original. It may be one of Sayles' best. The bayou is beautiful. The actors and actresses who play the locals are very convincing. I especially like the "prima donna" ladies who pretend to be sophisticated, but really are opinionated bigots. Of course, Sayles' regular shows up as a local fisherman. Straitharn plays a very believable cajun. I also like the way that the local blacks were portrayed. They were cajun blacks. They had their own style, but also were culturally similar to the local cajun whites. The cajun music, of course, was very good. The beau of Woodard's character was entertaining. He was a man of lots of experiences. He had a boyish charm, but also had a lot of responsibilities. He was very forward and positive thinking. This movie was very charming. It is strange that a movie about a pain-in-the neck wheelchair-bound woman, could actually be entertaining and positive. Somehow, Sayles accomplished this.

    "The Cajuns have always squeezed the passion fish, some swallow the passion fish, thinking hard of the one they want to be liked off." The successful soap star May-Alice Culhane is after a taxi accident a paraplegic, bound to her wheelchair. She returns to her childhood home in Louisiana. To cope with the sudden chock of the totally new situation (like this starts the movie, May-Alice not understanding where she is and what happened. Finally at home in her childhoods home she starts drinking and watching television as the only thing to do. For the ever changing help she is the unbearable 'bitch on wheels'. Until Chantelle enters the scene. We know all about the bitter, white mistress. What she was, what happened to her and how it is now for her. But Chantelle? Parts and bits of the black recovering cocaine addicts background emerges slowly in bits and pieces. When Lucas shows up. When her father with her daughter pays a visit. Her father is the legal guardian for her daughter: "as long I think it is necessary" he tells Chantelle, his daughter. The white mistress and her black servant seem to be far apart: white and black. Two different worlds. But not: they sit in the same boat (shown metaphoric when the movie ends. Chantelle: "We are stuck with each other" and answered by May-Alice: "For the time being." May-Alice is visited twice by her former work, hardly hiding their pity for May-Alice and her black servant. When nothing is left to hide behind the white bitterness and the black stubbornness the afford to pretend is with no meaning. The possibility emerges: not to recognize but to see the other. Each other. Both in need of help. Helping each other. With no-way-out-option. Instead pity: respect. They are assisted by Rennie, the childhood crush, the Cajun handyman (Chantelle mouthes silent to her: "He likes you." And Sugar LeDoux, the local cowboy with children around every corner. He seduces Chantelle with smiling charm and dances with her daughter at the local festivity. Watched by the critical eyes of Chantelles father. Does the cowboy want Chantelles heart he must behave. The womens forced-up respect transforms to friendship. Behind their private disaster as crippled successful soap star and the recovering cocaine addict eds last chance for a job. This job. Both on their way to accept again life. Mirroring each others needs. Both crippled: a white body and a black soul.

    Passion Fish, showcases its 2 principal characters' (May-Alice and Chantelle) hopefulness and hopelessness in a light which I had never realized previously. Where May-Alice relapses into a daze of misery and alcohol-induced mist of self-centeredness, Chantelle struggles alone towards her self-rehabilitation - two unlikely individuals who are connected at a very obvious level, by the conflict of their motivations for existence but at a deeper plane, related not by conflict but by identification of a shared identity. Named after a Cajun superstition about finding love, the movie opens with a close-up of May-Alice's eyes as she lays on a hospital bed, victim of a freak accident and now, very mean-tempered inheritor of a crippled body. Her soap acting rendered futile and raging at the seeming dithering uselessness of all hospice personnel in uniform (nurses, physical therapists, doctors, psychiatrists), May-Alice moves back to the family home by a Louisiana bayou in a clear attempt at drinking herself into oblivion. Bound to a wheelchair and perennially in front of the television with a wine bottle as an unshakeable appendage, she has an attendant nurse in the form of a feisty black nurse (Chantelle  who takes up this work for far more substantial reasons than what initially appear. May-Alice's curmudgeonly self-indulgence in wine and TV collide with the blunt denials and admonitions of Chantelle, with decidedly un-"nursey" approaches. This conflict of wills between two strong and set women lies at the heart of this film; a conflict which does not get manifested in typical conventionally hoarse and piquant scenes. What interested me immensely are the numerous tiny battles which emerge in the course of this war of wills  a tug here, a pull there followed by a push. Several times in the movie, I expected the dam of unresolved and unsatisfied emotions to burst into a torrent of screams and the inevitable firing of the nurse. It never came. Passion Fish intensely resists the easy transition of such a story into a likely tale of maudlin sentimentalism and spiritual upliftment. When I think of it, the movie is less of a motif for human tragedy or that of people who have suffered mentally or physically coming out of the ordeal as veritable angels. Then there is the Louisiana landscape and the comic portraits of an assortment of Alice-May's visitors, and a repressed but tender romance which materializes with an old acquaintance. To the back of the house, there are verdant and soothing wetlands teeming with herons, alligators and snakes while towards the front, the track which leads to it is dusty and decidedly un-photogenic with what I can only presume to be factories, pumping affluents into this seemingly serene lake. This two-tinged sepia is present everywhere in the movie. This many-layered portrayal of a story of two women is marked by engaging performances all-round and a screenplay which does not veer into the realm of the tear-jerker. One more thing, I love the "I didn't ask for the anal probe" monologue for its intensity and the sheer range of emotions it seeks to explore  from thrill to determination to anticipation to frustration to dismay and finally, resignation.

    "Passion Fish", directed and written by John Sayles, is a sturdy very good watch on the whole. I thought there was obviously a lot of thought that had gone into the lead characters plights and what each were struggling through. However, sometimes knit-picking isn't too fun but must be done, and there were 2 different things that brought the movie down from great to good. One was about a 5 minute diatribe that a side-character blathers about "anal-probes". My wife and I were sitting there watching and both looked at each other saying "wth was that", the editor completely asleep at the wheel. And secondly, the ending sort of fizzled. Correct these 2 inconsistencies, and I think the movie was an 8/10. Great job by leads McDownell and Woodard nonetheless, especially McDownell.

    A film about a woman struggling to live with herself after a life changing accident. She is paralyzed from the waist down and drinks by the hour. She goes through a slew of nurses at her Louisiana home until she finally comes to terms with one played by Alfre Woodard. The film is supported by strong character moments and superb dialog. Overall, it is a beautifully written and well crafted film. John Sayles does an amazing job directing, writing and editing. He extracts memorable performances from Mary McDonnell and Alfre Woodard, and never once shows an unnecessary scene or line. Look out for a supporting role from David Straithairn and the subtle yet poignant cinematography that drives the film to its end. (The Louisiana Bayous never looked so good!)

    Passion Fish (1992) I wish I could like John Sayles films more. They want to be so important and serious, about exceptional people in normal working America. Characters are dying to be felt for and understood, and the turns of events are poignant in simple ways we can relate to. So it is with Passion Fish, with a couple changes. For the first long part of the movie the main character, an ex-soap opera star recently made paraplegic, is completely unlikable. But eventually we come to appreciate her attitude, and other characters arrive, namely a nurse who can stick it out with her. So if all this sounds good, it is. But the writing is a little off, a little wrong, all the way through. Occasionally it's just a strain (I laughed out loud a couple times at it, not with it). There's not problem with the subjects and what they do, but what they say, a hair off key from what such real people would say. Or that's the sense you get. And the filming is adequate without being magical, or emphatic, or whatever it is that great movies pull off. The camera-work, the editing, the clunky addition of sounds, it's all a little crude, as if it didn't matter that it was just functional and used a few cheap devices (like a little montage sequence with snippets dissolving one into another like a sentimental ad). In fact, it has a television quality even though Sayles has never done t.v. as far as I know. If you are really into content, though, and real people with real problems, none of this will matter as much. And the compensations include gritty acting, which makes the most of the dialog. If this lack of style is your style, you'll like it. If you want formal intentions of any kind you might think it's slow and unartful.
