    When I was 5 I absolutely loved this film. Davey Crockett was one of my idols next to Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Ninja Turtles as a kid. It was hard for you not to see me and not hear The Ballad of Davey Crockett now and again. However that was nearly 10 years ago and that is about the same amount of time it's been since I have seen it. I looked over it recently and I know now why I liked itso much now. The film is humorous at points, dramatic at others but the action can be cheesy. Also I didn't liketheir use of stock footage. However over all the movie was pretty good.I suggest re watching it for those who watched it as a kid and eventhose who haven't seen it will enjoy it if they are up for watching a classic from Disney that isn't a cartoon.

    I first saw this film as a nine year old living in London back in 1955. This was at a matin&eacute;e performance and the cinema was filled to the rafters with kids and we loved it. This was the era of the baby boomers and we youngsters had no shortage of friends to play with. After the film about thirty of us went to our local park and re-enacted scenes from it even forming two sides, Mexicans and Americans, for the attack on the Alamo, an old air raid shelter. But my most prominent memory is of the Davy Crockett hat my Dad made me. This was the 'must have' of 1955 for us kids and so many were made it led to a very sharp decline in the cat population. My dad also made me a very credible musket that I kept for years. Happy memories of a great movie and a great time to be young.

    I saw this film when I was a lad and along with the coonskin cap it was so coolfor a young boy of the mid fifties. The Film was and remains funny, full of action, with great scenery and a good musical score with of course the great catchy Title song which was a big pop hit. Although the acting was at times not great Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsenm were great together and it remains my favourite all time film despite all the movies since then to 2012. My children have watched it with me several times and enjoyed it while commenting at the acting such as much delayed Indians falling down when shot. But hey it was fun, it was entertainment and I think was and is just great!

    Hadn't seen this picture since it was on TV. I was 12 at the time and my brother was 5 - he had a coonskin cap which he wore until just recently, I think. If you weren't around in the 50's, the Davy Crockett fad was huge - Everybody under the age of 10 was into it, with coonskin cap and other frontier paraphernalia. It seemed a very innocent time in the life of American society. "Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier" is quintessential family entertainment. It is a triptych, so to speak, as it is three consecutive shows strung together to make a movie, and I can tell you it is as good today as it was in 1954. It has an episodic quality more apparent now than when it was presented in three separate shows and there are the expected plot holes, but one makes allowances after all these years. Nevertheless, it is still a crowd-pleaser and all the fun and excitement is intact. Fess Parker makes a fine Davy Crockett and Buddy Ebsen is even better as his sidekick, George Russel. And don't forget 'Big Foot' Mason (Mike Mazurki), Thimblerig (Hans Conreid) and the villainous Red Stick (Pat Hogan) - they're all here. Yessir, a mighty fine movie. An added bonus is the catchy theme song. As Davy kept saying (he was partial to simplistic aphorisms), "Be sure you're right, then go ahead". If your decision is to see this movie, go ahead. You're right.

    Here is a movie that was a really huge childhood favorite of mine, and that movie is called Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier. And this movie is still as great as it was all of those years back when I first saw it. That's right, that is most certainly definitely right! This movie is still as good as it was all of those years back when I first saw it! I mean that this was an absolute favorite of mine when I was a little kid, and it is still an absolute favorite of mine to this very day! Now granted, this movie is not completely historically accurate, there are quite a few things in this movie that most likely did not happen in real life, but hey, this is a movie, there is bound to be some drama in it. Also, this movie may not be a masterpiece, it isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but it is still such an enjoyable time! Oh what lovely memories I have of this movie, it was great when I was a kid, and it is great now! In short, this is just a great movie for the entire family, it is top entertainment! Don't miss out on all of the fun! Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen's performances as Davy Crocket and his partner George are both very good, and at a few times, they were very hilarious! I don't mean that their acting was laughable, I mean that there acting was occasionally hilarious, they were funny, and they were great overall. Their great and sometimes funny acting really makes this movie a favorite of mine! I am going to repeat what I said earlier, Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier is a fun movie to watch and enjoy, it is totally and completely fun to watch. I am so glad that I saw this movie in the first place, because it is such a good movie. I'm sorry if I am sounding like this with a lot of movies that I have seen, but I just have a unique taste in movies. You really have got to watch this movie, because you are totally and completely going to love it! Get ready for some fun, not to mention some laughs when you watch this movie, because there are a few scenes in this movie in which you are going to be laughing! I'd tell you what happens in this movie, but I am not going to do that, because it would probably spoil everything for you. The only way to find out what happens in this movie is to see it for yourself. Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier is great entertainment for the whole family, don't miss it! Once a favorite of mine, always a favorite of mine, that's what this movie most definitely is! 10/10

    Spoiler/plot- 1955, The story contains many major plots dealing with American settling of the west. While exploring ever westward, Mr. Crockett sadly discovers that his wife, Polly has died from a 'fever' and his two young sons are now peacefully living with his sister-in-law. He decides to make another new home in this newly settled western county o Tennessee but finds out a local frontier bully is stealing the homes and land deeds of the settled Indians. Crockett is asked to become the local magistrate to bring law to the area. He becomes the lawgiver and stops the land stealing. This sets Mr. Crockett to state office and then Congressional national office in Washington Town. While on a speaking tour arranged by some crafty city slicker Congressional election manager Crockett is tricked to be out of Congress, and these politicians try to pass an anti-Indian law without his vote or presence in Congress. Mr. Crockett learns of this sham and returns to speak and vote against the law in Congress. In disgust, he resigns and leaves politics. Crockett decides to explore the new Texas Territory and gets involved in the Alamo freedom fight. Many historic Texan figures are brought into this part of the saga that eventually leads to the massacre at the Alamo for all. *Special Stars- Fess Parker, Buddy Ebsen, Hans Conried, Kenneth Tobey, Nick Cravat, Mike Mazurki. *Theme- Honesty will win out every time. *Based on- Crockett, Red Stick, President Jackson, and Travis & Bowie are legendary tales of history. *Trivia/location/goofs- Look for obvious continuity changes of Davey Crockett's coonskin hat in many fight and battle scenes. This film is features more violence in the fights and battles than the usual Disney productions. Crockett, Red Stick, President Jackson, and William Travis & Jim Bowie were real men and historical folk heroes. This is the first feature film released from Watt Disney Buena Vista Productions consisting of several Disneyland ABC TV show episode material. The Mike Fink keel boat race and the river pirates were another feature film. The second Davey Crockett feature film was 'Davey Crockett, And the River Pirates'. Look for less of the typical Disney on screen battle non-violence in the fight and war scenes. Also the film ends with the obvious heroic moral to the actions of the series heroes at the Alamo end. *Emotion- Rather well made movie and thoroughly enjoyable especially for those who lived through this era of Disney TV history in the first ABC network series. The 'Davey Crockett' fan mania was huge in America due to the popularity of Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen with this TV show. Disney went on to create more of this public fan 'mania' with Guy 'Zorro' Williams and many other folk heroes. These actors were now for making personal appearances at Anahiem's Disneyland theme park and across the country. Full of fun and good memories for the 'Baby Boomer' crowd, hopefully new ones for the younger set. This film is what made coonskin hats so popular with the 'under 10 years old' set.

    I grew up in the 50s when this came on TV and was glued to the set when it was on. I loved Fess Parker's accent, and still do to this day. I have bought and watched this Crockett series many times (and anything else that Mr Parker was ever in. If you were a baby boomer like me, you owned a coonskin cap and could sing the words to the song. The death of Fess Parker has brought back many good memories for me and this character. The other characters were memorable too, very well created and acted. This is a must watch for fans of Fess Parker as well as Buddy Ebsen and of Davy Crockett the man himself. All other actors who have portrayed this character, in my opinion, do not hold a candle to Fess Parker. And that includes another of my all time favorite actors, John Wayne.

    I would rather be beaten and be a man than to be elected and be a little puppy dog. I have always supported measures and principles and not men. I have acted fearless and independent and I never will regret my course. I would rather be politically buried than to be hypocritically immortalized. In a letter following his defeat in the 1830 elections, as quoted in David Crockett: The Man and the Legend (1994) by James Atkins Shackford, p. 133 Made in the Studios at Disney, Wowed the Audience in the 50's. Showed in the Cinemas, Showed on TV It's just as fun watching it on DVD Davy, Davy Crockett, Having fun on the clean frontier. In watching 'The Far Pavilions' ( a film chronicling the journey of Lewis and Clark with the Absent Minded Professor and Moses )with my mother , she noted that everything looked so clean. The pioneers were clean, the Indians were clean and even the trees were clean. Film makers of the 50's researched and portrayed very accurately how clean the frontier really was. There was some supper strength cleaner they brought with them that eliminated all dirt and grim. I believe it was called a production assistant. The same research was used and portrayed in Davy Crocket. At some point in my life I saw 'Davy Crocket: King of the Wild Fronteer'. The only scene I remembered was Davy letting his best buddy George Russel kiss his beautiful wife, just because he saved his life. I don't know any friend of mine who would let me kiss their beautiful wife. The film may not be historically accurate or maybe it is. It is however a film full of fun and high adventure. Davy is a likable fella. Someone you would have a beer with if he drank beer. He is funny, smart, adventures, humble; bear wrestler, has a cool coon cap, a good congressman (seriously) and a good Christian. The film is a tad bit choppy in parts due to the film being put together from 3 episodes of the Disney TV series. The action is very Disney Esq, for the audience of the time period but still dishes that adventure out rousingly. The other cool thing is that instead of straight narration, a group of singers sings the glories of Davy Crockett as a map is shown of his travels. Indiana Jones may have a cool orchestra theme, but doesn't have a Ballad about his exploits with his name. Take that Dr. Jones. Davy Crockett deserves a place among the other movies in your book shelf. It's fun and gives you a brief glimpse into an American legend. It also reminds you how dirty the world has gotten since the 1800's. Pop, pop, pop! Bom, bom, bom! throughout the day. No time for memorandums now. Go ahead! Liberty and Independence forever. Last entry in his diary, (5 March 1836)

    I had not seen the movie since I was a kid. I purchased the DVD and wondered if it would remain on the shelf forever with the many "I must watch one day" movies. At first I thought how bad the movie was. I have found before that Disney early movies were not really well made and the effects are pretty awful. There are scenes that are terrible, such as the "alligator attacking "sequence. Even the late, great Steve Irwin was not that good.The early scenes of the Indians were terrible.The white guys come across as racist bigots. I found myself just hoping the indians would win. I felt angry with Crocket for killing a beautiful bear. The world has changed and so have our attitudes. Thank heavens. At first I thought that this movie is terrible and in many ways it is. The history is woeful. The funny thing is that as the movie grows on you and you start to warm to it. The reason is simple. Fess Parker is delightful. It is him and him alone that carries the film. THe man is handsome and gives a superb under stated performance. He is Davey Crocket. Buddy Epstein is great too. There are scenes that are just too awful for words but sit back and enjoy the central performance. He is superb and very under rated. THe scenery is lovely; I wonder if its covered by real estate today. I hope not.

    Watching Disney's Davy Crockett at the impressionable, ripe old age of seven in 1954 started me on a lifelong love affair with American History. I now have in my den a flintlock Kentucky long rifle on one wall replete with arrowheads, powder horn, etc. and lots of Civil War (my other interest) books and just historical stuff in "my" room/retreat. Interestingly, I gave my co-worker (much younger than me) the Disney DVD to show his son. He gave it back to me stating he didn't want his son saying Injun or Redskin and wondered why the term "Native American" hadn't been dubbed in. I told him history was history and wasn't politically correct and that if the PC crowd had their way American history would indeed be revised. And by the by, I, as a person born in the USA was a "Native American". What a shame...am sure his son would have been enthralled!!! Watching those DVD's today brings my childhood rushing back to me and as I get older a keener sense of appreciation to Walt Disney and a gratitude to him for sparking my interest in our nation's history...thanks Walt!! And thanks Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen!!!

I have bought and watched this Crockett series many times (and anything else that Mr Parker was ever in. If you were a baby boomer like me, you owned a coonskin cap and could sing the words to the song. The death of Fess Parker has brought back many good memories for me and this character. The other characters were memorable too, very well created and acted. This is a must watch for fans of Fess Parker as well as Buddy Ebsen and of Davy Crockett the man himself. All other actors who have portrayed this character, in my opinion, do not hold a candle to Fess Parker. And that includes another of my all time favorite actors, John Wayne.

    I would rather be beaten and be a man than to be elected and be a little puppy dog. I have always supported measures and principles and not men. I have acted fearless and independent and I never will regret my course. I would rather be politically buried than to be hypocritically immortalized. In a letter following his defeat in the 1830 elections, as quoted in David Crockett: The Man and the Legend (1994) by James Atkins Shackford, p. 133 Made in the Studios at Disney, Wowed the Audience in the 50's. Showed in the Cinemas, Showed on TV It's just as fun watching it on DVD Davy, Davy Crockett, Having fun on the clean frontier. In watching 'The Far Pavilions' ( a film chronicling the journey of Lewis and Clark with the Absent Minded Professor and Moses )with my mother , she noted that everything looked so clean. The pioneers were clean, the Indians were clean and even the trees were clean. Film makers of the 50's researched and portrayed very accurately how clean the frontier really was. There was some supper strength cleaner they brought with them that eliminated all dirt and grim. I believe it was called a production assistant. The same research was used and portrayed in Davy Crocket. At some point in my life I saw 'Davy Crocket: King of the Wild Fronteer'. The only scene I remembered was Davy letting his best buddy George Russel kiss his beautiful wife, just because he saved his life. I don't know any friend of mine who would let me kiss their beautiful wife. The film may not be historically accurate or maybe it is. It is however a film full of fun and high adventure. Davy is a likable fella. Someone you would have a beer with if he drank beer. He is funny, smart, adventures, humble; bear wrestler, has a cool coon cap, a good congressman (seriously) and a good Christian. The film is a tad bit choppy in parts due to the film being put together from 3 episodes of the Disney TV series. The action is very Disney Esq, for the audience of the time period but still dishes that adventure out rousingly. The other cool thing is that instead of straight narration, a group of singers sings the glories of Davy Crockett as a map is shown of his travels. Indiana Jones may have a cool orchestra theme, but doesn't have a Ballad about his exploits with his name. Take that Dr. Jones. Davy Crockett deserves a place among the other movies in your book shelf. It's fun and gives you a brief glimpse into an American legend. It also reminds you how dirty the world has gotten since the 1800's. Pop, pop, pop! Bom, bom, bom! throughout the day. No time for memorandums now. Go ahead! Liberty and Independence forever. Last entry in his diary, (5 March 1836)

    I had not seen the movie since I was a kid. I purchased the DVD and wondered if it would remain on the shelf forever with the many "I must watch one day" movies. At first I thought how bad the movie was. I have found before that Disney early movies were not really well made and the effects are pretty awful. There are scenes that are terrible, such as the "alligator attacking "sequence. Even the late, great Steve Irwin was not that good.The early scenes of the Indians were terrible.The white guys come across as racist bigots. I found myself just hoping the indians would win. I felt angry with Crocket for killing a beautiful bear. The world has changed and so have our attitudes. Thank heavens. At first I thought that this movie is terrible and in many ways it is. The history is woeful. The funny thing is that as the movie grows on you and you start to warm to it. The reason is simple. Fess Parker is delightful. It is him and him alone that carries the film. THe man is handsome and gives a superb under stated performance. He is Davey Crocket. Buddy Epstein is great too. There are scenes that are just too awful for words but sit back and enjoy the central performance. He is superb and very under rated. THe scenery is lovely; I wonder if its covered by real estate today. I hope not.

    Watching Disney's Davy Crockett at the impressionable, ripe old age of seven in 1954 started me on a lifelong love affair with American History. I now have in my den a flintlock Kentucky long rifle on one wall replete with arrowheads, powder horn, etc. and lots of Civil War (my other interest) books and just historical stuff in "my" room/retreat. Interestingly, I gave my co-worker (much younger than me) the Disney DVD to show his son. He gave it back to me stating he didn't want his son saying Injun or Redskin and wondered why the term "Native American" hadn't been dubbed in. I told him history was history and wasn't politically correct and that if the PC crowd had their way American history would indeed be revised. And by the by, I, as a person born in the USA was a "Native American". What a shame...am sure his son would have been enthralled!!! Watching those DVD's today brings my childhood rushing back to me and as I get older a keener sense of appreciation to Walt Disney and a gratitude to him for sparking my interest in our nation's history...thanks Walt!! And thanks Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen!!!

    When I was 5 I absolutely loved this film. Davey Crockett was one of my idols next to Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Ninja Turtles as a kid. It was hard for you not to see me and not hear The Ballad of Davey Crockett now and again. However that was nearly 10 years ago and that is about the same amount of time it's been since I have seen it. I looked over it recently and I know now why I liked itso much now. The film is humorous at points, dramatic at others but the action can be cheesy. Also I didn't liketheir use of stock footage. However over all the movie was pretty good.I suggest re watching it for those who watched it as a kid and eventhose who haven't seen it will enjoy it if they are up for watching a classic from Disney that isn't a cartoon.

    I first saw this film as a nine year old living in London back in 1955. This was at a matin&eacute;e performance and the cinema was filled to the rafters with kids and we loved it. This was the era of the baby boomers and we youngsters had no shortage of friends to play with. After the film about thirty of us went to our local park and re-enacted scenes from it even forming two sides, Mexicans and Americans, for the attack on the Alamo, an old air raid shelter. But my most prominent memory is of the Davy Crockett hat my Dad made me. This was the 'must have' of 1955 for us kids and so many were made it led to a very sharp decline in the cat population. My dad also made me a very credible musket that I kept for years. Happy memories of a great movie and a great time to be young.

    I saw this film when I was a lad and along with the coonskin cap it was so coolfor a young boy of the mid fifties. The Film was and remains funny, full of action, with great scenery and a good musical score with of course the great catchy Title song which was a big pop hit. Although the acting was at times not great Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsenm were great together and it remains my favourite all time film despite all the movies since then to 2012. My children have watched it with me several times and enjoyed it while commenting at the acting such as much delayed Indians falling down when shot. But hey it was fun, it was entertainment and I think was and is just great!

    Hadn't seen this picture since it was on TV. I was 12 at the time and my brother was 5 - he had a coonskin cap which he wore until just recently, I think. If you weren't around in the 50's, the Davy Crockett fad was huge - Everybody under the age of 10 was into it, with coonskin cap and other frontier paraphernalia. It seemed a very innocent time in the life of American society. "Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier" is quintessential family entertainment. It is a triptych, so to speak, as it is three consecutive shows strung together to make a movie, and I can tell you it is as good today as it was in 1954. It has an episodic quality more apparent now than when it was presented in three separate shows and there are the expected plot holes, but one makes allowances after all these years. Nevertheless, it is still a crowd-pleaser and all the fun and excitement is intact. Fess Parker makes a fine Davy Crockett and Buddy Ebsen is even better as his sidekick, George Russel. And don't forget 'Big Foot' Mason (Mike Mazurki), Thimblerig (Hans Conreid) and the villainous Red Stick (Pat Hogan) - they're all here. Yessir, a mighty fine movie. An added bonus is the catchy theme song. As Davy kept saying (he was partial to simplistic aphorisms), "Be sure you're right, then go ahead". If your decision is to see this movie, go ahead. You're right.

    Here is a movie that was a really huge childhood favorite of mine, and that movie is called Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier. And this movie is still as great as it was all of those years back when I first saw it. That's right, that is most certainly definitely right! This movie is still as good as it was all of those years back when I first saw it! I mean that this was an absolute favorite of mine when I was a little kid, and it is still an absolute favorite of mine to this very day! Now granted, this movie is not completely historically accurate, there are quite a few things in this movie that most likely did not happen in real life, but hey, this is a movie, there is bound to be some drama in it. Also, this movie may not be a masterpiece, it isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but it is still such an enjoyable time! Oh what lovely memories I have of this movie, it was great when I was a kid, and it is great now! In short, this is just a great movie for the entire family, it is top entertainment! Don't miss out on all of the fun! Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen's performances as Davy Crocket and his partner George are both very good, and at a few times, they were very hilarious! I don't mean that their acting was laughable, I mean that there acting was occasionally hilarious, they were funny, and they were great overall. Their great and sometimes funny acting really makes this movie a favorite of mine! I am going to repeat what I said earlier, Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier is a fun movie to watch and enjoy, it is totally and completely fun to watch. I am so glad that I saw this movie in the first place, because it is such a good movie. I'm sorry if I am sounding like this with a lot of movies that I have seen, but I just have a unique taste in movies. You really have got to watch this movie, because you are totally and completely going to love it! Get ready for some fun, not to mention some laughs when you watch this movie, because there are a few scenes in this movie in which you are going to be laughing! I'd tell you what happens in this movie, but I am not going to do that, because it would probably spoil everything for you. The only way to find out what happens in this movie is to see it for yourself. Davy Crockett, King Of The Wild Frontier is great entertainment for the whole family, don't miss it! Once a favorite of mine, always a favorite of mine, that's what this movie most definitely is! 10/10

    Spoiler/plot- 1955, The story contains many major plots dealing with American settling of the west. While exploring ever westward, Mr. Crockett sadly discovers that his wife, Polly has died from a 'fever' and his two young sons are now peacefully living with his sister-in-law. He decides to make another new home in this newly settled western county o Tennessee but finds out a local frontier bully is stealing the homes and land deeds of the settled Indians. Crockett is asked to become the local magistrate to bring law to the area. He becomes the lawgiver and stops the land stealing. This sets Mr. Crockett to state office and then Congressional national office in Washington Town. While on a speaking tour arranged by some crafty city slicker Congressional election manager Crockett is tricked to be out of Congress, and these politicians try to pass an anti-Indian law without his vote or presence in Congress. Mr. Crockett learns of this sham and returns to speak and vote against the law in Congress. In disgust, he resigns and leaves politics. Crockett decides to explore the new Texas Territory and gets involved in the Alamo freedom fight. Many historic Texan figures are brought into this part of the saga that eventually leads to the massacre at the Alamo for all. *Special Stars- Fess Parker, Buddy Ebsen, Hans Conried, Kenneth Tobey, Nick Cravat, Mike Mazurki. *Theme- Honesty will win out every time. *Based on- Crockett, Red Stick, President Jackson, and Travis & Bowie are legendary tales of history. *Trivia/location/goofs- Look for obvious continuity changes of Davey Crockett's coonskin hat in many fight and battle scenes. This film is features more violence in the fights and battles than the usual Disney productions. Crockett, Red Stick, President Jackson, and William Travis & Jim Bowie were real men and historical folk heroes. This is the first feature film released from Watt Disney Buena Vista Productions consisting of several Disneyland ABC TV show episode material. The Mike Fink keel boat race and the river pirates were another feature film. The second Davey Crockett feature film was 'Davey Crockett, And the River Pirates'. Look for less of the typical Disney on screen battle non-violence in the fight and war scenes. Also the film ends with the obvious heroic moral to the actions of the series heroes at the Alamo end. *Emotion- Rather well made movie and thoroughly enjoyable especially for those who lived through this era of Disney TV history in the first ABC network series. The 'Davey Crockett' fan mania was huge in America due to the popularity of Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen with this TV show. Disney went on to create more of this public fan 'mania' with Guy 'Zorro' Williams and many other folk heroes. These actors were now for making personal appearances at Anahiem's Disneyland theme park and across the country. Full of fun and good memories for the 'Baby Boomer' crowd, hopefully new ones for the younger set. This film is what made coonskin hats so popular with the 'under 10 years old' set.
