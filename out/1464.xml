    I was born and raised in Henrietta. I graduated from there. I still visit often because I have family there. My granddad was born there as well as my dad. The actual events/people, I don't think happened. Having said that it is true that for many years no one believed there was oil there. Not until some somebody managed to find it. So while the people are different and the situations, I think that it has to be basically a true story if only loosely. But let me tell you that the real history and the real "stars" of that area are the old folks. If you listen to their stories, they will take you back to a different time with them. The only problem is that since they have lived in such a small place for such a long time, you might get a full genealogy report on half the county. LOL. Its just the way the culture is. Its nice (and more than a little amazing) to see a movie about my little hometown, I have to admit.

    Quite simply, 'The Stars Fell on Henrietta' is a contender for the finest of the very best films ever made and it is proof that the Golden Era of films did not end in the 1930's. Robert Duvall portrays an 'oil man', Mr Cox, who is convinced there is oil on land worked by a poor farmer, Don Day (played by Aiden Quinn). This is a film with an underlying message (that dreams exist because they can be realised)which is portrayed very sensitively, skilfully and subtly. Like other reviewers, I too am wondering why this perfectly lovely film is not yet available on DVD.

    Robert Duvall is a man on a quest. He is a true believer in his skills at finding oil, and will go to any means to achieve his dream of bringing in the "big one", assault and theft included. His character, Mr. Cox, is somewhat "shady", but likable. Look for Billy Bob Thornton in a supporting role as an oil rig workman. Like any true dreamer, the hunt is what it is all about, and so it is not surprising that Mr. Cox moves on to his next challenge, rather than basking in his hard earned glory. "The Stars Fell on Henrietta" is solid entertainment, especially for anyone who dreams of trying the impossible. Highly recommended - MERK

    I also regret this movie not being in wide release. The oil derricks were authentic for the period. I was part of the security for this film. Some interesting facts were that during one night an old barn owl made it into the set, and the interior of the house had to be re-blocked. A severe thunderstorm also damaged some of the vintage cars that were parked under a tent. The production crew were wonderful and very hospitable. Malpaso Productions is a first rate organization. The producer, Clint Eastwood was very personable and great to work for. I only wish this film was released in wide release. Maybe at some point it will be on DVD.

    Well, I've seen this fairly-unknown film three times now and perhaps that's enough, but I'm sorry that in late 2006 it is still not out on DVD. It deserves being seen on disc and discovered. Why this is so "unkonw," I don't know. Robert Duvall, who almost never gives a bad performance, is excellent in here, too, as the ever-optimistic "Mr. Cox." He's a self-described oil man but in truth has never done anything noteworthy in the business. However, after finding himself in a small Texas town called "Henrietta," (which really exists) he thinks this one residence has a lot of oil on its property. The tough part is trying to convince the literally-poor landowner (Aiden Quinn) that he should invest $5,000 on a well. All kinds of obstacles ensue - an nonsupporting wife (Frances Fisher), an antagonistic and hot-tempered villain who runs things in the area (Brian Dennehy) and just plain bad luck. Duvall and his pet cat who sticks by him like glue throughout much of the film, keeps this story together. When I first saw this, the whole movie fascinated me. Now, I don't enjoy the middle third where everything goes wrong. It's just too unpleasant, especially seeing a nice guy like Quinn's character be treated so coldly by his wife. I also to see the good guy, "Cox," doing what he did late in the film, although it certainly adds life to the story. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth a look if you like a good drama and appreciate Duvall's talents.

    This was a heartfelt movie. Especially since I live in Henrietta Texas. I have lived here for about 6 years now and enjoy this small little town. People in this town are so sweet and hard working. So this movie caught my heart a little more being that I live here. We have very old buildings, houses, churches and a lot of history. We have an annual Pioneer Reunion every September, I believe going on 78 years now. Our old jail museum is a sight and it has a lot of history as well. Our courthouse is absolutely beautiful. If anyone ever gets a chance come see our little town. A lot of people will come here and say there isn't much to do here but if you get the right person they can show you so much history. I believe our school system uses this movie for a homework project as well. There were a lot of great actors in this movie that nailed the personalities around here.

    Set in the 1930s at Henrietta, Texas, near Wichita Falls. Don Day is a farmer. He and his family are surviving on cornbread. Robert Duvall plays Mr. Cox, an oil prospecting expert. A realistic dust storm is shown. Mr. Cox tells Don Day that there is oil under his land, although the area is thought to be dry by the oil drilling industry. Don Day bets everything he has on striking oil. He pulls a drilling rig home with his Fordson. Mr. Cox is a decent sort of a man, but the oil drilling industry has some unsavory characters in it. They do strike oil, and pressure blows the pipes out of the ground. Don't know if this is a true story, but seems like it could have been.

    It was a disappointment that this picture was not in wide release. Warner's and Malpaso productions took great care in assuring that every detail was perfect 1935 style. "Henrietta" was made here in the Abilene area and I ran the dailies at my theatre for eight weeks. I was also on the set most of the time and thought it to be a major production. Clint Eastwood produced, Bruce Surtees was the director of photography and the great Henry Bumstead did the production design. One of our best actors, Robert Duvall was cast as Mr. Cox and Aidean Quinn and Francis Fisher played Don Day and his wife. How could a picture like this miss? It played at only a few theaters and was quickly picked up by all the cable TV people. This film is far better than most of the movies being released today and I hope more people get to see it.

    I found this film to be one of the most heartwarming,genuine,thrilling and unforgettable ones I'd ever seen.Its simple brilliance is astounding.Robert Duvall gives one of his ten best performances ever as the charming and aging,but maverick drifter who discovers an oil field on the property of the most unlikely to get rich people.Aidan Quinn and Frances Fisher are also marvellous.Clint Eastwood produced this feature and I think it just shows his ability to choose the right projects,an ability he has always had. If you can't enjoy this,then it means you are one of those who have to have blood and guts,fast cars and hot chicks and action to enjoy yourself.And Iam not of that kind,thank god.All in all,this is the loveliest picture since "Its a wonderful life".Just pay attention and be patient and Iam sure you'll discover its true value.I give this film 10 out of 10!

    This movie does an outstanding job of reclaiming the human spirit. Robert Duvall's character believes in himself and strongly adheres to his gut feelings, when everyone else treats him with humiliation or passes him off as a quack. For people to have faith in their dreams and keep their dignity in the face of all diversity are wonderful things. Hitch your wagon to a star sweetheart, I've lived my life by that (one of the best movie quotes in the world).
