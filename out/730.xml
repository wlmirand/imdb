    For those wanting to know the original story, please make the effort to read the book by Alexandre Dumas. This being said, this movie has everything I hate in french cinema ( I myself am french ! ) : it is pretentious, badly interpreted, the original story was largely rewritten and furthermore, I found the movie to be incoherent and incomprehensible. Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie, I wonder if people saw the same movie I did... Topmost, I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers, as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play. A few examples : the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book... As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas ( who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book ) which is at the center of the original material, it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent : after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other, the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad. Anyways, all this is bad french cinema making, the kind which we would like to stop seeing. Do not bother to waste your time on that piece of trash and rather watch real french cinema d'auteur like Coup de Torchon or Rene Clair's movies which are the real heritage of french movie making that knew about the art, but are from another age which is sadly over. Pityful ! PS : sorry my English isn't good enough to say everything I despise in this movie with the language it would require.

    An interesting and original attempt to reconstruct 16th century French court society. The atmosphere is grimy, violent and claustrophobic, with repeated outbursts of extravagantly expressed, uncontrolled emotion. The power structure of feudal society is clearly shown as distinctly different from today's, being more of a network of explicitly violent threats than an ideological legal framework, a theory which was also expressed quite well in the first of the recent Elizabeth films (the second one is excremental). If our rulers today were expected to prove their prowess by fighting large fierce mammals, politics would look rather different. The film portrays an extremely important episode in French and European history, a major step towards the establishment of Absolutism which then led to its own downfall in the Revolution. However the major political developments are left in the background. I was barely able to sketch them in with my own vague knowledge of the time, so this film might be a bit difficult to understand with no background knowledge at all. Hopefully this will stimulate viewers to find out more! There is prominent sexual content in this film. In my opinion it was neither excessive nor gratuitous. Sexuality was an important part of feudal court politics, and the emotional content of all the sex scenes forms an integral part of the portrayal of the characters' complex and conflicting motivations. There is also explicit violence. Again, this is integral to the development of the plot, characters and atmosphere. Perpetrators of the massacre are shown to be traumatised by what they have done and seen. This is an ambitious film, skilfully made, whose greatest strength is a vivid expression of an interesting theory about the nature of society in the time in which it is set.

    La Reine Margot is about the St. Bartholomew's day massacre and the intrigues at the court before and after the event. It uniquely tries to denominate Catherine de Medicis as the evil culprit as can be seen, in a way, by her terrible Italian accent. Even though till today the orchestrator of the massacre is in doubt, the movie seems to place the blame on an outsider, on an Italian. Ah, the French, always weary of the outsider. It is close to hilarious to see the portrayal of Charles the ninth as a hypochondriac/drunk, always under the control of external influences. External from himself. Himself representing France. An acute sense of this movie can be derived from a dialog lasting fifteen or so seconds, and which I could not get out of my head {and I kept telling myself throughout the film}. It is the scene where Margot tells Charles XIX, after he witnesses the massacre: Calme-Toi, Calme-Toi. The film is a stupid, overly dramatized piece of work that plays to the emotions of the French. It is a crime against historical fiction and should be persecuted to the fullest extent; the penalty being its burning. The burning of all its copies, original and duplicate reels, so that not a word of it might be spoken of; ever.

    If you are not familiar with the French history, this movie may be a little painful to you. As for me, I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with all those characters and events so that refrained myself from getting lost with the story. Adjani is really beautiful, she's kind of combination of Monica Beluci and Sophie Marcau. Maybe beautiful people all resemble. The edition I saw has already cut off the sex scene, so the story appeared fragmented to me. Despite it, the tragical destiny of Queen Margot is still very clear. Her marriage was used by her mum as a bait for a massacre, her beautiful body was used by her brothers as sex tools. And the only man she fell in love with began with a one-night- sex, and ended up on a guillotine. How desperate and helpless can a woman feel! Adjani did a great job in presenting all those feelings--noble, slutty, considerate or desperate. Her beautiful blue eyes are like a quite lake, you can never tell what's beneath.

    Well, rarely have I seen a period movie of such poor standard. A period piece from 1994, I might add. One would think it had been filmed in the early 80s where stories were often quite na&iuml;ve. The robes were magnificent and Isabelle Adjani looks like a perfect porcelain doll but the acting, the storytelling, the editing - they were all horrendous. Picture one of those romantic novels with undeveloped shallow characters you enjoyed when you were 12 and make one of them into a movie - this is the excact feeling I got when I watched La Reine Margot. SPOILER (Except without the usual happy endings those novels used to give you of course). The only positive comment this movie will get from me is that Vincent Perez looked incredibly sexy and hot and his final scene was quite heartbreaking. For that alone I will give this poorly made movie 2 out of 10 stars. It really shouldn't get any.

    ....that I bought the new 2-disc remastered restored DIRECTORS CUT from Amazon.fr. -speaking nor able to read any French. Already having the English subtitled but excellently transfered 16:9 138 min NTSC version from Korea, I knew the gist of the story, and a few French words stood out. The film is a masterwork and left me stunned. Isabelle Adjani-should have been given the honor of a seat next to the throne of God himself, for her utterly stunning performance-where she gives her all-screw the Oscars -they know nothing. And Daniel Auteuel has become a favorite of mine-and gave an excellent performance, too. Pity his lover, the young Baroness, played by a lovely Asia Argento, as she meets a horrible fate. (Is there a poison that could act THAT quickly?-the idea was, I suppose, that 'French kissing' would spread the poison between the two, but a very quick cut shows her licking her fingers after she applied the Lip gloss, just before Margot breaks in) And the mysterious confidante of Margot, Henriette was a bit of an enigma. Will MIRAMAX ever get wise and do the 160 min version 16:9? There were still 10 mins of cut scenes, on disc 2, which are on par quality-wise with the film itself, which in America are usually sabotaged in some way, in the studios paranoid fear of some one getting any ideas about reconstructing a film on DVD- Interesting-On all the made in French DVDs I have-they use an attractive, tasteful way to put the WARNING DO NOT COPY at the start-it is artfully inserted, low key, in keeping with the film story, using font and pictures from the film-as the warnings travel horizontally past- EDV 117 So watching their "FBI" warnings are almost a pleasure of short, SHORT film-making in and of itself.

    I am at a loss to explain the high rating of this film. For such a long film there is surprisingly little character development or contextual information, so that much of the characters' behaviour appears ridiculous and the significance of the people and events is lost. The film jumps from event to event, via periods of gratuitous gore and nudity, without any real flow. Too much is crammed into too little time, probably also for the even longer original cut. The performances are fine (considering what they have to work with) and it does look fantastic but that's about it. I can overlook taking liberties with history but not terrible film-making. French melodrama of the very worst kind!

    If as a young boy, I had been able to watch a film like La Reine Margot I would probably have enjoyed history a lot more than I did. The first time I saw it at the cinema it knocked me out and I had to go back again later that week. Now I have it on DVD I'm still seeing and understand more with each viewing finding myself searching the internet for the historical record of the events portrayed. Seeing it again now, the only thing that slightly jarred was the make-up. It may be accurate but seems to look slightly out of period although I'm not an expert by any means. I think it helped that there were no recognizable 'Hollywood' actors and I also think it should be compulsory viewing for every History student.

    I love well done historical fiction and films. This one is excellently done, in it's acting, sumptuous sets, costumes, lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking, with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding. It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations, and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously, especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere. Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life, the major historical events including the massacre, and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise, Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage, are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented, but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here, except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life  whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one. The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically, but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure, that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers, it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity, and largely invented both her "sisterly" loyalty to her husband, and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally. Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin, just not the man she was forced to marry, but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate, also often simultaneous, overlapping, in quick succession, and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed, she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani, though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed, false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her, which seems to have had little basis. It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers, but they were generally supposed to do so discretely, in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband, if honorable. Husbands too, though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs, were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect, and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this, or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either. It's not clear she ever accomplished much, including having any children, not to mention any heir to the French throne  which she could have done (unless as seems likely she was, or became, barren - STD's?). More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots, not because she believed in their religious cause, but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism, or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri, who acted upon them especially after becoming "the Good" King Henri of France, but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas, and likely by earlier Huguenot tales, traditions and perhaps lesser novels, in aide of gallantry, the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. (There was after all, they said, at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre.) This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots, since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion, politics or idealism. As well her close personal, "sisterly", relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas, in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go, despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go, with or without her lover(s). Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France (who takes power as the film ends) and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later, when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old, isolated and nearly penniless, in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship, Henri brought her back to the French court, where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life. I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.

    I can't recall ever being disappointed in a film written by Daniele Thompson who has gone on to prove herself a brilliant writer-director also. Nothing if not versatile she began with one of the biggest box-office hits in French cinema, La Grande Vadrouille, which is still being revived close to half a century later and continued in comedic vein with such titles as Les Folies de grandeur and The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob whilst along the way launching the career of Sophie Marceau via La Boum - if these two ladies were fillies rather than filles we could employ handicapper terms to note that Marceau has just released her own second film as writer-director - before turning serious as she does here and also with Those Who Love Me Can Take The Train. This time around she is working with historical facts as distorted through the prism of Alexander Dumas and giving them a new coat of paint before setting them before Isabelle Adjani, Virna Lisi, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Huges Anglade, Pascall Greggory, Vincent Perez and, if you're paying attention to every frame, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, all of which, with the possible exception of Perez, turn in fine performances modulating toward the exceptional in the case of Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici. The plot has been discussed elsewhere so suffice it to say that as costume dramas go this is among the best even if the direction is the odd light year behind Thompson's screenplay.

The film jumps from event to event, via periods of gratuitous gore and nudity, without any real flow. Too much is crammed into too little time, probably also for the even longer original cut. The performances are fine (considering what they have to work with) and it does look fantastic but that's about it. I can overlook taking liberties with history but not terrible film-making. French melodrama of the very worst kind!

    If as a young boy, I had been able to watch a film like La Reine Margot I would probably have enjoyed history a lot more than I did. The first time I saw it at the cinema it knocked me out and I had to go back again later that week. Now I have it on DVD I'm still seeing and understand more with each viewing finding myself searching the internet for the historical record of the events portrayed. Seeing it again now, the only thing that slightly jarred was the make-up. It may be accurate but seems to look slightly out of period although I'm not an expert by any means. I think it helped that there were no recognizable 'Hollywood' actors and I also think it should be compulsory viewing for every History student.

    I love well done historical fiction and films. This one is excellently done, in it's acting, sumptuous sets, costumes, lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking, with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding. It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations, and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously, especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere. Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life, the major historical events including the massacre, and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise, Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage, are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented, but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here, except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life  whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one. The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically, but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure, that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers, it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity, and largely invented both her "sisterly" loyalty to her husband, and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally. Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin, just not the man she was forced to marry, but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate, also often simultaneous, overlapping, in quick succession, and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed, she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani, though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed, false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her, which seems to have had little basis. It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers, but they were generally supposed to do so discretely, in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband, if honorable. Husbands too, though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs, were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect, and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this, or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either. It's not clear she ever accomplished much, including having any children, not to mention any heir to the French throne  which she could have done (unless as seems likely she was, or became, barren - STD's?). More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots, not because she believed in their religious cause, but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism, or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri, who acted upon them especially after becoming "the Good" King Henri of France, but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas, and likely by earlier Huguenot tales, traditions and perhaps lesser novels, in aide of gallantry, the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. (There was after all, they said, at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre.) This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots, since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion, politics or idealism. As well her close personal, "sisterly", relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas, in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go, despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go, with or without her lover(s). Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France (who takes power as the film ends) and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later, when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old, isolated and nearly penniless, in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship, Henri brought her back to the French court, where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life. I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.

    I can't recall ever being disappointed in a film written by Daniele Thompson who has gone on to prove herself a brilliant writer-director also. Nothing if not versatile she began with one of the biggest box-office hits in French cinema, La Grande Vadrouille, which is still being revived close to half a century later and continued in comedic vein with such titles as Les Folies de grandeur and The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob whilst along the way launching the career of Sophie Marceau via La Boum - if these two ladies were fillies rather than filles we could employ handicapper terms to note that Marceau has just released her own second film as writer-director - before turning serious as she does here and also with Those Who Love Me Can Take The Train. This time around she is working with historical facts as distorted through the prism of Alexander Dumas and giving them a new coat of paint before setting them before Isabelle Adjani, Virna Lisi, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Huges Anglade, Pascall Greggory, Vincent Perez and, if you're paying attention to every frame, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, all of which, with the possible exception of Perez, turn in fine performances modulating toward the exceptional in the case of Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici. The plot has been discussed elsewhere so suffice it to say that as costume dramas go this is among the best even if the direction is the odd light year behind Thompson's screenplay.

    For those wanting to know the original story, please make the effort to read the book by Alexandre Dumas. This being said, this movie has everything I hate in french cinema ( I myself am french ! ) : it is pretentious, badly interpreted, the original story was largely rewritten and furthermore, I found the movie to be incoherent and incomprehensible. Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie, I wonder if people saw the same movie I did... Topmost, I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers, as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play. A few examples : the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book... As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas ( who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book ) which is at the center of the original material, it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent : after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other, the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad. Anyways, all this is bad french cinema making, the kind which we would like to stop seeing. Do not bother to waste your time on that piece of trash and rather watch real french cinema d'auteur like Coup de Torchon or Rene Clair's movies which are the real heritage of french movie making that knew about the art, but are from another age which is sadly over. Pityful ! PS : sorry my English isn't good enough to say everything I despise in this movie with the language it would require.

    An interesting and original attempt to reconstruct 16th century French court society. The atmosphere is grimy, violent and claustrophobic, with repeated outbursts of extravagantly expressed, uncontrolled emotion. The power structure of feudal society is clearly shown as distinctly different from today's, being more of a network of explicitly violent threats than an ideological legal framework, a theory which was also expressed quite well in the first of the recent Elizabeth films (the second one is excremental). If our rulers today were expected to prove their prowess by fighting large fierce mammals, politics would look rather different. The film portrays an extremely important episode in French and European history, a major step towards the establishment of Absolutism which then led to its own downfall in the Revolution. However the major political developments are left in the background. I was barely able to sketch them in with my own vague knowledge of the time, so this film might be a bit difficult to understand with no background knowledge at all. Hopefully this will stimulate viewers to find out more! There is prominent sexual content in this film. In my opinion it was neither excessive nor gratuitous. Sexuality was an important part of feudal court politics, and the emotional content of all the sex scenes forms an integral part of the portrayal of the characters' complex and conflicting motivations. There is also explicit violence. Again, this is integral to the development of the plot, characters and atmosphere. Perpetrators of the massacre are shown to be traumatised by what they have done and seen. This is an ambitious film, skilfully made, whose greatest strength is a vivid expression of an interesting theory about the nature of society in the time in which it is set.

    La Reine Margot is about the St. Bartholomew's day massacre and the intrigues at the court before and after the event. It uniquely tries to denominate Catherine de Medicis as the evil culprit as can be seen, in a way, by her terrible Italian accent. Even though till today the orchestrator of the massacre is in doubt, the movie seems to place the blame on an outsider, on an Italian. Ah, the French, always weary of the outsider. It is close to hilarious to see the portrayal of Charles the ninth as a hypochondriac/drunk, always under the control of external influences. External from himself. Himself representing France. An acute sense of this movie can be derived from a dialog lasting fifteen or so seconds, and which I could not get out of my head {and I kept telling myself throughout the film}. It is the scene where Margot tells Charles XIX, after he witnesses the massacre: Calme-Toi, Calme-Toi. The film is a stupid, overly dramatized piece of work that plays to the emotions of the French. It is a crime against historical fiction and should be persecuted to the fullest extent; the penalty being its burning. The burning of all its copies, original and duplicate reels, so that not a word of it might be spoken of; ever.

    If you are not familiar with the French history, this movie may be a little painful to you. As for me, I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with all those characters and events so that refrained myself from getting lost with the story. Adjani is really beautiful, she's kind of combination of Monica Beluci and Sophie Marcau. Maybe beautiful people all resemble. The edition I saw has already cut off the sex scene, so the story appeared fragmented to me. Despite it, the tragical destiny of Queen Margot is still very clear. Her marriage was used by her mum as a bait for a massacre, her beautiful body was used by her brothers as sex tools. And the only man she fell in love with began with a one-night- sex, and ended up on a guillotine. How desperate and helpless can a woman feel! Adjani did a great job in presenting all those feelings--noble, slutty, considerate or desperate. Her beautiful blue eyes are like a quite lake, you can never tell what's beneath.

    Well, rarely have I seen a period movie of such poor standard. A period piece from 1994, I might add. One would think it had been filmed in the early 80s where stories were often quite na&iuml;ve. The robes were magnificent and Isabelle Adjani looks like a perfect porcelain doll but the acting, the storytelling, the editing - they were all horrendous. Picture one of those romantic novels with undeveloped shallow characters you enjoyed when you were 12 and make one of them into a movie - this is the excact feeling I got when I watched La Reine Margot. SPOILER (Except without the usual happy endings those novels used to give you of course). The only positive comment this movie will get from me is that Vincent Perez looked incredibly sexy and hot and his final scene was quite heartbreaking. For that alone I will give this poorly made movie 2 out of 10 stars. It really shouldn't get any.

    ....that I bought the new 2-disc remastered restored DIRECTORS CUT from Amazon.fr. -speaking nor able to read any French. Already having the English subtitled but excellently transfered 16:9 138 min NTSC version from Korea, I knew the gist of the story, and a few French words stood out. The film is a masterwork and left me stunned. Isabelle Adjani-should have been given the honor of a seat next to the throne of God himself, for her utterly stunning performance-where she gives her all-screw the Oscars -they know nothing. And Daniel Auteuel has become a favorite of mine-and gave an excellent performance, too. Pity his lover, the young Baroness, played by a lovely Asia Argento, as she meets a horrible fate. (Is there a poison that could act THAT quickly?-the idea was, I suppose, that 'French kissing' would spread the poison between the two, but a very quick cut shows her licking her fingers after she applied the Lip gloss, just before Margot breaks in) And the mysterious confidante of Margot, Henriette was a bit of an enigma. Will MIRAMAX ever get wise and do the 160 min version 16:9? There were still 10 mins of cut scenes, on disc 2, which are on par quality-wise with the film itself, which in America are usually sabotaged in some way, in the studios paranoid fear of some one getting any ideas about reconstructing a film on DVD- Interesting-On all the made in French DVDs I have-they use an attractive, tasteful way to put the WARNING DO NOT COPY at the start-it is artfully inserted, low key, in keeping with the film story, using font and pictures from the film-as the warnings travel horizontally past- EDV 117 So watching their "FBI" warnings are almost a pleasure of short, SHORT film-making in and of itself.

    La Reine Margot is about the St. Bartholomew's day massacre and the intrigues at the court before and after the event. It uniquely tries to denominate Catherine de Medicis as the evil culprit as can be seen, in a way, by her terrible Italian accent. Even though till today the orchestrator of the massacre is in doubt, the movie seems to place the blame on an outsider, on an Italian. Ah, the French, always weary of the outsider. It is close to hilarious to see the portrayal of Charles the ninth as a hypochondriac/drunk, always under the control of external influences. External from himself. Himself representing France. An acute sense of this movie can be derived from a dialog lasting fifteen or so seconds, and which I could not get out of my head {and I kept telling myself throughout the film}. It is the scene where Margot tells Charles XIX, after he witnesses the massacre: Calme-Toi, Calme-Toi. The film is a stupid, overly dramatized piece of work that plays to the emotions of the French. It is a crime against historical fiction and should be persecuted to the fullest extent; the penalty being its burning. The burning of all its copies, original and duplicate reels, so that not a word of it might be spoken of; ever.

    If you are not familiar with the French history, this movie may be a little painful to you. As for me, I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with all those characters and events so that refrained myself from getting lost with the story. Adjani is really beautiful, she's kind of combination of Monica Beluci and Sophie Marcau. Maybe beautiful people all resemble. The edition I saw has already cut off the sex scene, so the story appeared fragmented to me. Despite it, the tragical destiny of Queen Margot is still very clear. Her marriage was used by her mum as a bait for a massacre, her beautiful body was used by her brothers as sex tools. And the only man she fell in love with began with a one-night- sex, and ended up on a guillotine. How desperate and helpless can a woman feel! Adjani did a great job in presenting all those feelings--noble, slutty, considerate or desperate. Her beautiful blue eyes are like a quite lake, you can never tell what's beneath.

    Well, rarely have I seen a period movie of such poor standard. A period piece from 1994, I might add. One would think it had been filmed in the early 80s where stories were often quite na&iuml;ve. The robes were magnificent and Isabelle Adjani looks like a perfect porcelain doll but the acting, the storytelling, the editing - they were all horrendous. Picture one of those romantic novels with undeveloped shallow characters you enjoyed when you were 12 and make one of them into a movie - this is the excact feeling I got when I watched La Reine Margot. SPOILER (Except without the usual happy endings those novels used to give you of course). The only positive comment this movie will get from me is that Vincent Perez looked incredibly sexy and hot and his final scene was quite heartbreaking. For that alone I will give this poorly made movie 2 out of 10 stars. It really shouldn't get any.

    ....that I bought the new 2-disc remastered restored DIRECTORS CUT from Amazon.fr. -speaking nor able to read any French. Already having the English subtitled but excellently transfered 16:9 138 min NTSC version from Korea, I knew the gist of the story, and a few French words stood out. The film is a masterwork and left me stunned. Isabelle Adjani-should have been given the honor of a seat next to the throne of God himself, for her utterly stunning performance-where she gives her all-screw the Oscars -they know nothing. And Daniel Auteuel has become a favorite of mine-and gave an excellent performance, too. Pity his lover, the young Baroness, played by a lovely Asia Argento, as she meets a horrible fate. (Is there a poison that could act THAT quickly?-the idea was, I suppose, that 'French kissing' would spread the poison between the two, but a very quick cut shows her licking her fingers after she applied the Lip gloss, just before Margot breaks in) And the mysterious confidante of Margot, Henriette was a bit of an enigma. Will MIRAMAX ever get wise and do the 160 min version 16:9? There were still 10 mins of cut scenes, on disc 2, which are on par quality-wise with the film itself, which in America are usually sabotaged in some way, in the studios paranoid fear of some one getting any ideas about reconstructing a film on DVD- Interesting-On all the made in French DVDs I have-they use an attractive, tasteful way to put the WARNING DO NOT COPY at the start-it is artfully inserted, low key, in keeping with the film story, using font and pictures from the film-as the warnings travel horizontally past- EDV 117 So watching their "FBI" warnings are almost a pleasure of short, SHORT film-making in and of itself.

    I am at a loss to explain the high rating of this film. For such a long film there is surprisingly little character development or contextual information, so that much of the characters' behaviour appears ridiculous and the significance of the people and events is lost. The film jumps from event to event, via periods of gratuitous gore and nudity, without any real flow. Too much is crammed into too little time, probably also for the even longer original cut. The performances are fine (considering what they have to work with) and it does look fantastic but that's about it. I can overlook taking liberties with history but not terrible film-making. French melodrama of the very worst kind!

    If as a young boy, I had been able to watch a film like La Reine Margot I would probably have enjoyed history a lot more than I did. The first time I saw it at the cinema it knocked me out and I had to go back again later that week. Now I have it on DVD I'm still seeing and understand more with each viewing finding myself searching the internet for the historical record of the events portrayed. Seeing it again now, the only thing that slightly jarred was the make-up. It may be accurate but seems to look slightly out of period although I'm not an expert by any means. I think it helped that there were no recognizable 'Hollywood' actors and I also think it should be compulsory viewing for every History student.

    I love well done historical fiction and films. This one is excellently done, in it's acting, sumptuous sets, costumes, lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking, with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding. It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations, and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously, especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere. Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life, the major historical events including the massacre, and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise, Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage, are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented, but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here, except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life  whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one. The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically, but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure, that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers, it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity, and largely invented both her "sisterly" loyalty to her husband, and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally. Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin, just not the man she was forced to marry, but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate, also often simultaneous, overlapping, in quick succession, and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed, she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani, though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed, false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her, which seems to have had little basis. It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers, but they were generally supposed to do so discretely, in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband, if honorable. Husbands too, though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs, were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect, and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this, or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either. It's not clear she ever accomplished much, including having any children, not to mention any heir to the French throne  which she could have done (unless as seems likely she was, or became, barren - STD's?). More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots, not because she believed in their religious cause, but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism, or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri, who acted upon them especially after becoming "the Good" King Henri of France, but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas, and likely by earlier Huguenot tales, traditions and perhaps lesser novels, in aide of gallantry, the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. (There was after all, they said, at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre.) This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots, since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion, politics or idealism. As well her close personal, "sisterly", relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas, in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go, despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go, with or without her lover(s). Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France (who takes power as the film ends) and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later, when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old, isolated and nearly penniless, in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship, Henri brought her back to the French court, where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life. I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.

    I can't recall ever being disappointed in a film written by Daniele Thompson who has gone on to prove herself a brilliant writer-director also. Nothing if not versatile she began with one of the biggest box-office hits in French cinema, La Grande Vadrouille, which is still being revived close to half a century later and continued in comedic vein with such titles as Les Folies de grandeur and The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob whilst along the way launching the career of Sophie Marceau via La Boum - if these two ladies were fillies rather than filles we could employ handicapper terms to note that Marceau has just released her own second film as writer-director - before turning serious as she does here and also with Those Who Love Me Can Take The Train. This time around she is working with historical facts as distorted through the prism of Alexander Dumas and giving them a new coat of paint before setting them before Isabelle Adjani, Virna Lisi, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Huges Anglade, Pascall Greggory, Vincent Perez and, if you're paying attention to every frame, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, all of which, with the possible exception of Perez, turn in fine performances modulating toward the exceptional in the case of Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici. The plot has been discussed elsewhere so suffice it to say that as costume dramas go this is among the best even if the direction is the odd light year behind Thompson's screenplay.

    For those wanting to know the original story, please make the effort to read the book by Alexandre Dumas. This being said, this movie has everything I hate in french cinema ( I myself am french ! ) : it is pretentious, badly interpreted, the original story was largely rewritten and furthermore, I found the movie to be incoherent and incomprehensible. Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie, I wonder if people saw the same movie I did... Topmost, I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers, as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play. A few examples : the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book... As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas ( who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book ) which is at the center of the original material, it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent : after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other, the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad. Anyways, all this is bad french cinema making, the kind which we would like to stop seeing. Do not bother to waste your time on that piece of trash and rather watch real french cinema d'auteur like Coup de Torchon or Rene Clair's movies which are the real heritage of french movie making that knew about the art, but are from another age which is sadly over. Pityful ! PS : sorry my English isn't good enough to say everything I despise in this movie with the language it would require.

    An interesting and original attempt to reconstruct 16th century French court society. The atmosphere is grimy, violent and claustrophobic, with repeated outbursts of extravagantly expressed, uncontrolled emotion. The power structure of feudal society is clearly shown as distinctly different from today's, being more of a network of explicitly violent threats than an ideological legal framework, a theory which was also expressed quite well in the first of the recent Elizabeth films (the second one is excremental). If our rulers today were expected to prove their prowess by fighting large fierce mammals, politics would look rather different. The film portrays an extremely important episode in French and European history, a major step towards the establishment of Absolutism which then led to its own downfall in the Revolution. However the major political developments are left in the background. I was barely able to sketch them in with my own vague knowledge of the time, so this film might be a bit difficult to understand with no background knowledge at all. Hopefully this will stimulate viewers to find out more! There is prominent sexual content in this film. In my opinion it was neither excessive nor gratuitous. Sexuality was an important part of feudal court politics, and the emotional content of all the sex scenes forms an integral part of the portrayal of the characters' complex and conflicting motivations. There is also explicit violence. Again, this is integral to the development of the plot, characters and atmosphere. Perpetrators of the massacre are shown to be traumatised by what they have done and seen. This is an ambitious film, skilfully made, whose greatest strength is a vivid expression of an interesting theory about the nature of society in the time in which it is set.

I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.

    I can't recall ever being disappointed in a film written by Daniele Thompson who has gone on to prove herself a brilliant writer-director also. Nothing if not versatile she began with one of the biggest box-office hits in French cinema, La Grande Vadrouille, which is still being revived close to half a century later and continued in comedic vein with such titles as Les Folies de grandeur and The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob whilst along the way launching the career of Sophie Marceau via La Boum - if these two ladies were fillies rather than filles we could employ handicapper terms to note that Marceau has just released her own second film as writer-director - before turning serious as she does here and also with Those Who Love Me Can Take The Train. This time around she is working with historical facts as distorted through the prism of Alexander Dumas and giving them a new coat of paint before setting them before Isabelle Adjani, Virna Lisi, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Huges Anglade, Pascall Greggory, Vincent Perez and, if you're paying attention to every frame, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, all of which, with the possible exception of Perez, turn in fine performances modulating toward the exceptional in the case of Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici. The plot has been discussed elsewhere so suffice it to say that as costume dramas go this is among the best even if the direction is the odd light year behind Thompson's screenplay.

    For those wanting to know the original story, please make the effort to read the book by Alexandre Dumas. This being said, this movie has everything I hate in french cinema ( I myself am french ! ) : it is pretentious, badly interpreted, the original story was largely rewritten and furthermore, I found the movie to be incoherent and incomprehensible. Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie, I wonder if people saw the same movie I did... Topmost, I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers, as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play. A few examples : the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book... As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas ( who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book ) which is at the center of the original material, it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent : after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other, the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad. Anyways, all this is bad french cinema making, the kind which we would like to stop seeing. Do not bother to waste your time on that piece of trash and rather watch real french cinema d'auteur like Coup de Torchon or Rene Clair's movies which are the real heritage of french movie making that knew about the art, but are from another age which is sadly over. Pityful ! PS : sorry my English isn't good enough to say everything I despise in this movie with the language it would require.

    An interesting and original attempt to reconstruct 16th century French court society. The atmosphere is grimy, violent and claustrophobic, with repeated outbursts of extravagantly expressed, uncontrolled emotion. The power structure of feudal society is clearly shown as distinctly different from today's, being more of a network of explicitly violent threats than an ideological legal framework, a theory which was also expressed quite well in the first of the recent Elizabeth films (the second one is excremental). If our rulers today were expected to prove their prowess by fighting large fierce mammals, politics would look rather different. The film portrays an extremely important episode in French and European history, a major step towards the establishment of Absolutism which then led to its own downfall in the Revolution. However the major political developments are left in the background. I was barely able to sketch them in with my own vague knowledge of the time, so this film might be a bit difficult to understand with no background knowledge at all. Hopefully this will stimulate viewers to find out more! There is prominent sexual content in this film. In my opinion it was neither excessive nor gratuitous. Sexuality was an important part of feudal court politics, and the emotional content of all the sex scenes forms an integral part of the portrayal of the characters' complex and conflicting motivations. There is also explicit violence. Again, this is integral to the development of the plot, characters and atmosphere. Perpetrators of the massacre are shown to be traumatised by what they have done and seen. This is an ambitious film, skilfully made, whose greatest strength is a vivid expression of an interesting theory about the nature of society in the time in which it is set.

    La Reine Margot is about the St. Bartholomew's day massacre and the intrigues at the court before and after the event. It uniquely tries to denominate Catherine de Medicis as the evil culprit as can be seen, in a way, by her terrible Italian accent. Even though till today the orchestrator of the massacre is in doubt, the movie seems to place the blame on an outsider, on an Italian. Ah, the French, always weary of the outsider. It is close to hilarious to see the portrayal of Charles the ninth as a hypochondriac/drunk, always under the control of external influences. External from himself. Himself representing France. An acute sense of this movie can be derived from a dialog lasting fifteen or so seconds, and which I could not get out of my head {and I kept telling myself throughout the film}. It is the scene where Margot tells Charles XIX, after he witnesses the massacre: Calme-Toi, Calme-Toi. The film is a stupid, overly dramatized piece of work that plays to the emotions of the French. It is a crime against historical fiction and should be persecuted to the fullest extent; the penalty being its burning. The burning of all its copies, original and duplicate reels, so that not a word of it might be spoken of; ever.

    If you are not familiar with the French history, this movie may be a little painful to you. As for me, I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with all those characters and events so that refrained myself from getting lost with the story. Adjani is really beautiful, she's kind of combination of Monica Beluci and Sophie Marcau. Maybe beautiful people all resemble. The edition I saw has already cut off the sex scene, so the story appeared fragmented to me. Despite it, the tragical destiny of Queen Margot is still very clear. Her marriage was used by her mum as a bait for a massacre, her beautiful body was used by her brothers as sex tools. And the only man she fell in love with began with a one-night- sex, and ended up on a guillotine. How desperate and helpless can a woman feel! Adjani did a great job in presenting all those feelings--noble, slutty, considerate or desperate. Her beautiful blue eyes are like a quite lake, you can never tell what's beneath.

    Well, rarely have I seen a period movie of such poor standard. A period piece from 1994, I might add. One would think it had been filmed in the early 80s where stories were often quite na&iuml;ve. The robes were magnificent and Isabelle Adjani looks like a perfect porcelain doll but the acting, the storytelling, the editing - they were all horrendous. Picture one of those romantic novels with undeveloped shallow characters you enjoyed when you were 12 and make one of them into a movie - this is the excact feeling I got when I watched La Reine Margot. SPOILER (Except without the usual happy endings those novels used to give you of course). The only positive comment this movie will get from me is that Vincent Perez looked incredibly sexy and hot and his final scene was quite heartbreaking. For that alone I will give this poorly made movie 2 out of 10 stars. It really shouldn't get any.

    ....that I bought the new 2-disc remastered restored DIRECTORS CUT from Amazon.fr. -speaking nor able to read any French. Already having the English subtitled but excellently transfered 16:9 138 min NTSC version from Korea, I knew the gist of the story, and a few French words stood out. The film is a masterwork and left me stunned. Isabelle Adjani-should have been given the honor of a seat next to the throne of God himself, for her utterly stunning performance-where she gives her all-screw the Oscars -they know nothing. And Daniel Auteuel has become a favorite of mine-and gave an excellent performance, too. Pity his lover, the young Baroness, played by a lovely Asia Argento, as she meets a horrible fate. (Is there a poison that could act THAT quickly?-the idea was, I suppose, that 'French kissing' would spread the poison between the two, but a very quick cut shows her licking her fingers after she applied the Lip gloss, just before Margot breaks in) And the mysterious confidante of Margot, Henriette was a bit of an enigma. Will MIRAMAX ever get wise and do the 160 min version 16:9? There were still 10 mins of cut scenes, on disc 2, which are on par quality-wise with the film itself, which in America are usually sabotaged in some way, in the studios paranoid fear of some one getting any ideas about reconstructing a film on DVD- Interesting-On all the made in French DVDs I have-they use an attractive, tasteful way to put the WARNING DO NOT COPY at the start-it is artfully inserted, low key, in keeping with the film story, using font and pictures from the film-as the warnings travel horizontally past- EDV 117 So watching their "FBI" warnings are almost a pleasure of short, SHORT film-making in and of itself.

    I am at a loss to explain the high rating of this film. For such a long film there is surprisingly little character development or contextual information, so that much of the characters' behaviour appears ridiculous and the significance of the people and events is lost. The film jumps from event to event, via periods of gratuitous gore and nudity, without any real flow. Too much is crammed into too little time, probably also for the even longer original cut. The performances are fine (considering what they have to work with) and it does look fantastic but that's about it. I can overlook taking liberties with history but not terrible film-making. French melodrama of the very worst kind!

    If as a young boy, I had been able to watch a film like La Reine Margot I would probably have enjoyed history a lot more than I did. The first time I saw it at the cinema it knocked me out and I had to go back again later that week. Now I have it on DVD I'm still seeing and understand more with each viewing finding myself searching the internet for the historical record of the events portrayed. Seeing it again now, the only thing that slightly jarred was the make-up. It may be accurate but seems to look slightly out of period although I'm not an expert by any means. I think it helped that there were no recognizable 'Hollywood' actors and I also think it should be compulsory viewing for every History student.

    I love well done historical fiction and films. This one is excellently done, in it's acting, sumptuous sets, costumes, lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking, with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding. It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations, and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously, especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere. Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life, the major historical events including the massacre, and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise, Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage, are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented, but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here, except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life  whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one. The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically, but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure, that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers, it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity, and largely invented both her "sisterly" loyalty to her husband, and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally. Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin, just not the man she was forced to marry, but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate, also often simultaneous, overlapping, in quick succession, and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed, she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani, though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed, false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her, which seems to have had little basis. It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers, but they were generally supposed to do so discretely, in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband, if honorable. Husbands too, though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs, were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect, and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this, or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either. It's not clear she ever accomplished much, including having any children, not to mention any heir to the French throne  which she could have done (unless as seems likely she was, or became, barren - STD's?). More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots, not because she believed in their religious cause, but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism, or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri, who acted upon them especially after becoming "the Good" King Henri of France, but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas, and likely by earlier Huguenot tales, traditions and perhaps lesser novels, in aide of gallantry, the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. (There was after all, they said, at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre.) This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots, since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion, politics or idealism. As well her close personal, "sisterly", relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas, in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go, despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go, with or without her lover(s). Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France (who takes power as the film ends) and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later, when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old, isolated and nearly penniless, in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship, Henri brought her back to the French court, where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life. I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.
