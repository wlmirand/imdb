    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3."

It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

    WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution. I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing. So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.) Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not. As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of. So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got. In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies. So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.

    OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.

    Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into. It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside. IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .

    Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.

    I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.

    Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.

    Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time... Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!

    It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3." There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching. I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.

    Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape. Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism  a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters  is the franchise's best quality. Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films. It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver  iconic with her bald, shaven head  sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows. Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers. As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director. 7/10  Worth two viewings.

IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds. For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.

    Ridley Scott did a thriller sci fi masterpiece back in 1979 , the James Cameron conceived a sequel on par with the first movie , he even added some new characters to the Alien universe just to make the story go further in the future , now in 1992 we had this sad excuse which i'll never consider as a canon . Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .
