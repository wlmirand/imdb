    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing. However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing. However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats  Low budget comedy and romance for some good fun

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into.

However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing. However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing. However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats  Low budget comedy and romance for some good fun

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into.

However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. "Mallrats" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor. ** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck

    first off I've always like anything Shannon Doherty has been in every since Beverly Hills 90210. so that was the first reason I bought this film,, second Ben Affleck is always good to see what he's gonna do next in a movie, you never know,, third I figured a movie taking place in a shopping mall, what a good idea.. it's basically about a couple of guys who have ex-girlfriends now , and are trying to figure what to do next , either win them back or get on with their lives.. along the way they meet up with friends. and Stan Lee. this is a very quirky movie that will either be liked or disliked one way or the other there is really no middle ground to this point, I believe you don't need to be a stoner to like this movie at all, I really enjoyed Michael Rooker's performance here as well as a dad hosting a major TV show at the mall,, great dark humor and slapstick all the way.. loved this movie.

    Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts. Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance. The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.

    After a successful debut with "Clerks", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the "stink hand" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, "Mallrats" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.

    After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels. With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film. There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak. Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats. But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years. What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here. Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue. Film Rating: 63% Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%): Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com

    When I was little, I really wanted to see this. The day I finally watched it, I didn't regret it for a second. The movie has lovable characters, a clever plot, silly jokes, a raunchy vibe, and directed by a legendary man named Kevin Smith! If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it. The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends. They decide to wander around the mall and join their friends in misadventures. Check it out and if you're a fan of Kevin Smith films, you won't be disappointed.

    Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.

    After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received. Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero). Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them. Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is. I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.

    It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, "fashionable male" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a "Dating Game"-type TV show as a favor to her father... By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing.

    Movie was great. Wished I could have seen it in a theater when it was out. I remember the 3D poster advertisements on the backs of my old comics. After listening to the commentary tracks I found out why the picture was M.I.A.(missing in action)when I had the cash to see the flick. Would have made a great date movie for my generation. Might still work today if people can fathom a world without cell phones. !!!Bonus!!! The story tackles the pains of maintaining a relationship. Plus the consequences of slacking in that department. Showing us relationships do take work. Brilliantly written."Thumbs up." Watch the flick. Cudos to View Askew movies. Watch and enjoy peoples.

    Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, "Hey, I would do the same thing!". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.
