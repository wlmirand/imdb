    Having laughed my backside off while still in my teens, continued to laugh my cheeks off with each subsequent viewing in my twenties and now, at the ripe age of 36, having recently split my sides once more on the first viewing in nearly ten years, all I can conclude is that the viewers who conspired to rate Senior Trip (as i will always know it) so badly were clearly watching the wrong kind of film for them. It's perfectly casted, over-the-top, amusingly written and acted and ticks just about every box you want from an occasionally crass teen-comedy... in fact it ticks most boxes twice, and in bold. Do not let the score deceive you. Like Flight of The Living Dead, this is a film I have shared with at least twenty people over the years, of different ages, tastes, backgrounds, genders and religions - and I've not had a single negative response.

    The 'National Lampoon' series grinds on. Matt Frewer is a high school principal who assigns his degenerate pupils the detention project of writing a letter to the President explaining how the education system has failed them. The President is so impressed he invites them to Washington, so all the kids pile into a rickety bus and head off to the capital. This juvenile teen comedy manages to contain just about every genre stereotype - the fat slob, the cool joker, the prissy swot and so on - but it does raise a few laughs along the way, thanks in no small part to Frewer's manic performance, as opposed to, say, decent writing. Still, it's kind of fun and is by no means the worst of the series.

    This is the worst movie in America!!! I am guessing that the people who wrote great reviews on this were clearly under the influence of some heavy duty drugs. I have loved most of the National Lampoon's movies, but this one should not be associated with the classics. The writing is horrible. The acting is worse than spoof movies. Now I know these movies are to be silly and meant to be somewhat dumb. I get that, but there should be some decent scenes among all of the really stupid ones, which this movie only consists of. There are not any intelligent screen plays. The absurd man chasing the bus, is by far outrageous. It is ridiculous at best. Watch at your own risk.

    I love how you can spice up virtually anything by putting "National Lampoon's" in front of it. It may not mean anything because National Lampoon lends its name to everything that moves, but it always has a nice ring to it. If you can't think of a clever title for your movie, just say what it's about and put "National Lampoon's" in front, it always works. The movie itself well, it's nothing special. The same tired stereotypes you see in every college movie go on (you've guessed it) a senior trip to party and cause mayhem and just generally do things that you'd rather do than watch. Meanwhile a ridiculously one-dimensional principal tries to put a stop to this because well, just because. The jokes are pretty stale, and the characters are unlikeable, but I still enjoyed this movie for some reason. It's a pretty good compilation of clich&eacute;s I guess, its strength lies in its predictability. Also Tommy Chong appears, that always helps. Not the best college movie, but still easy to get through.

    Senior Trip (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Two stoners, wanting the best for their senior year, decide to throw a party at the house of their lamebrain principal but when the big guy catches him he decides to punish everyone there with Saturday detention. Those who got caught were the previously mentioned stoners, an overweight guy who is constantly eating something, the good girl virgin, the school slut, the black guy who wants to be Malcolm X plus a computer dork who enjoys reading Playboy magazine since he can't get a real woman. In the detention center the kids are made to write a letter to the President on the current state of education in America. Of course the smart girl ends up doing the report and it turns out that the letter actually makes it to the White House and the President decides to let the kids come to Washington so that they can introduce his new education bill. They've got two days to get to Washington and the road trip begins when Red (Tommy Chong), the horse pill popping bus driver shows up and declares the party official. The next two days are full of your typical sex and drugs but when the kids learn that they are just being used for political reasons, they decide to show that they aren't dumb after all. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is without a doubt one of the dumbest, most lame films ever made. Everything from the acting to the directing to the so-called screenplay are amateurish and perhaps that's being a bit too nice. There isn't a single original idea throughout the entire film and most of the time the film tries to go all out with over the top stereotypes as well as silly party scenes leading up to a so-called dramatic ending where the losers become winners. Every single scene in this film is something we've previously seen yet we're fortunate because the film is still pretty damn funny. The term so bad it's good certainly applies to this film. What makes this bad movie work is the effort that is obviously going on throughout it. You can tell that the actors are trying their best to recreate earlier teen films like National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's but they fail horribly in every sense yet them failing so badly is what gets a laugh from the viewer. We can look at all the stereotypes, which are seen the same way they were back in the 1980's. We've got the fat kid who does nothing in the movie except eat food. We get a dork who loves Playboy magazine yet fails to perform when a sex kitten offers him the time of his life. We get the good-girl virgin who deep down really wants to go wild with sex and alcohol. We got the bad boy who likes her and is willing to be a bit on the good side to get down her pants. We then get the dork teachers pet who deep down is a homosexual. The stereotypes themselves are very politically incorrect, which also adds to some of the charm. There's a hilarious, if stupid, scene where the teacher's pet is asked by the Principle for help and the guy gets down on his knees thinking that's the help needed. We get another scene where the overweight guy goes all out on his fantasy where he would have sex with a real Jap from China. We even get a nice porno take of Forrest Gump called Forrest Humps. If all of this sounds incredibly stupid, well it is and that's what makes the film funny. All of these jokes, as bad as they are, are being acted and directed as if they were the greatest comic lines ever written so we're left laughing at ourselves laughing at the film more than we're actually laughing at what's in the film. The biggest stab in the film goes towards Star Trek fans as one characters is so obsessed with the series that he goes all out (with his rubber sex partner) to destroy one of the senior members. There another politically incorrect scene where the Trek-nut kidnaps a Chinese family, which has to be seen to believe. Then there's the cameo by Tommy Chong, which while funny should have been a whole lot better. Sadly all the promos made it feel that he would have a large chunk in the film but he's in and out way too quickly but before he goes Chong delivers a few good pot jokes as well as a nice homage back to his days with Cheech. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is a very poor film but if you don't mind an offensive and lamebrain film then I'm sure you'll get enough chuckles out of it. You certainly shouldn't go into this thing expecting anything like Animal House and if you do you'll certainly be very disappointed. This is a very poorly made film that thankfully gets bad enough to get a few laughs. When I originally saw this in the theaters I was hoping this would be a return form to the good old days where teen comedies weren't rated PG-13 and didn't have a silly message to relay. There's no message here and the dirtiness certainly deserved the R-rating but by in large, the film is forgotten for a reason and I doubt a cult will ever pick up on it.

    On one level, this is a really horrible movie that tries to make heroes out of slackers, potheads and social rejects, but on another more subliminal level, the kids in this movie are like the largest comedy team ever seen. They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from "Star Trek" don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone: an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke clich&eacute; role he plays in every movie: a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of "Animal House," the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

    I should say that "Senior Trip" is mostly one of the silly comedies that they released in the 1990s (of course, it was intended as such). I guess that on one level, it has an important lesson about paying attention to what happens in the government. In my opinion, the best parts were some of the briefer things: the guy chasing the bus, J. Edgar Hoover's grave*, the porno movie in the hotel room, and the epilogues. Otherwise, this isn't the sort of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch. Although I have to admit, Matt Frewer (who turns 50 today) and Tommy Chong play great characters. *The student was right: J. Edgar Hoover was a fascist. You may have heard the news that just recently came out that Hoover wanted to round up large numbers of Americans in 1950.

    I really wanted to like this movie, but I could only come up for 3 reasons to suggest anyone else endure this movie. Tommy Chong, Tara Strong and Nicole de Boer. Quite frankly, Chong isn't enough of a reason since he can be seen in better form in a dozen other choices and de Boer is a minor player at best. You are better off watching the last few seasons of Deep Space Nine to be mesmerized by Nicole. So that leaves us with Tara. Yes, Tara is enough of a reason to watch this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited. Tara on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous.

    Where did this movie go wrong? Where do I start? 1.) In being made by National Lampoon, it appeared to try way too hard to be "Animal House". There was a stupid fat guy, an uptight head of the school, a straight laced honor student, and the rest of the student got drunk and/or stoned. There was one militant black guy that would have made an interesting character, but his character was pushed to the back too often. Above all, you didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the main characters, which is why the movie didn't play out very well. 2.) The principal was unnecessarily stupid. When the "evil" senator threatened to have the principal revoked from his job, I didn't blame him. The principal character should have been the moral center of the story, the only sane person in an insane situation. That kind of situation makes for uproarious laughter, and it's something the writers, not to mention the actor who played him, should have taken into account. 3.) The title of the movie didn't fit. Yes the students were seniors, and yes they were going on a trip, making the title "Senior Trip" sound obvious enough. However, the title made you think that every senior was going on this trip, which was not true. Plus, the students didn't embark on the trip until halfway through the movie, since the premise took too long to extrapolate before the movie's main premise got underway. In my opinion, the beginning scene with the "High On Life" band was completely unnecessary, not to mention not funny. I'm not a stoner, and I would have booed that band. 4.) The movie employed too many movie clich&eacute;s which weighed down the potential hilarity of the movie, from the uptight teacher getting her hands on alcohol to the undeserved slow clapping to the unnecessary epilogue at the end of the movie. One could argue that it was parodying other movies, but this movie didn't appear to parody anything. 5.) Kevin McDonald. Simply putting him in any movie is a bad idea. Sure he was funny when he was with the Kids In The Hall, but nearly every movie he has been in has sucked, from "The Godson" to "The Ladies Man" to this movie. Plus, his character wasn't necessary to the movie, and you had no clue why he was chasing these kids to D.C. other than the fact that he had nothing better to do. If there is a plus side to his character, it reminds you that hardcore Trekkies are too damn annoying to function properly in today's society. I did buy this movie for $8.00 in a special "Double Feature" edition with "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1" on the other side of the disc. At least four of my dollars didn't go to waste.

    Before i watched this movie i thought that it would suck but this movie turned out to be good and the movies about how some high school students are in detention and they write a letter to the President about what is wrong with the education system and the President reads it and he likes it and then he asks them to come to Washington to met him.There are some funny scenes in this movie like how one of the students farts in front of a fire setting some one on fire and all of the party scenes.This movie stars actors and actress like Matt Frewer,Lawrence Dane,Tara Strong,Valerie Mahaffey,Tommy Chong and Sergio Di Zio.Over all this movie was good and my rating is 6 out of 10.

It lacks the spirit of "Animal House," the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

    I should say that "Senior Trip" is mostly one of the silly comedies that they released in the 1990s (of course, it was intended as such). I guess that on one level, it has an important lesson about paying attention to what happens in the government. In my opinion, the best parts were some of the briefer things: the guy chasing the bus, J. Edgar Hoover's grave*, the porno movie in the hotel room, and the epilogues. Otherwise, this isn't the sort of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch. Although I have to admit, Matt Frewer (who turns 50 today) and Tommy Chong play great characters. *The student was right: J. Edgar Hoover was a fascist. You may have heard the news that just recently came out that Hoover wanted to round up large numbers of Americans in 1950.

    I really wanted to like this movie, but I could only come up for 3 reasons to suggest anyone else endure this movie. Tommy Chong, Tara Strong and Nicole de Boer. Quite frankly, Chong isn't enough of a reason since he can be seen in better form in a dozen other choices and de Boer is a minor player at best. You are better off watching the last few seasons of Deep Space Nine to be mesmerized by Nicole. So that leaves us with Tara. Yes, Tara is enough of a reason to watch this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited. Tara on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous.

    Where did this movie go wrong? Where do I start? 1.) In being made by National Lampoon, it appeared to try way too hard to be "Animal House". There was a stupid fat guy, an uptight head of the school, a straight laced honor student, and the rest of the student got drunk and/or stoned. There was one militant black guy that would have made an interesting character, but his character was pushed to the back too often. Above all, you didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the main characters, which is why the movie didn't play out very well. 2.) The principal was unnecessarily stupid. When the "evil" senator threatened to have the principal revoked from his job, I didn't blame him. The principal character should have been the moral center of the story, the only sane person in an insane situation. That kind of situation makes for uproarious laughter, and it's something the writers, not to mention the actor who played him, should have taken into account. 3.) The title of the movie didn't fit. Yes the students were seniors, and yes they were going on a trip, making the title "Senior Trip" sound obvious enough. However, the title made you think that every senior was going on this trip, which was not true. Plus, the students didn't embark on the trip until halfway through the movie, since the premise took too long to extrapolate before the movie's main premise got underway. In my opinion, the beginning scene with the "High On Life" band was completely unnecessary, not to mention not funny. I'm not a stoner, and I would have booed that band. 4.) The movie employed too many movie clich&eacute;s which weighed down the potential hilarity of the movie, from the uptight teacher getting her hands on alcohol to the undeserved slow clapping to the unnecessary epilogue at the end of the movie. One could argue that it was parodying other movies, but this movie didn't appear to parody anything. 5.) Kevin McDonald. Simply putting him in any movie is a bad idea. Sure he was funny when he was with the Kids In The Hall, but nearly every movie he has been in has sucked, from "The Godson" to "The Ladies Man" to this movie. Plus, his character wasn't necessary to the movie, and you had no clue why he was chasing these kids to D.C. other than the fact that he had nothing better to do. If there is a plus side to his character, it reminds you that hardcore Trekkies are too damn annoying to function properly in today's society. I did buy this movie for $8.00 in a special "Double Feature" edition with "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1" on the other side of the disc. At least four of my dollars didn't go to waste.

    Before i watched this movie i thought that it would suck but this movie turned out to be good and the movies about how some high school students are in detention and they write a letter to the President about what is wrong with the education system and the President reads it and he likes it and then he asks them to come to Washington to met him.There are some funny scenes in this movie like how one of the students farts in front of a fire setting some one on fire and all of the party scenes.This movie stars actors and actress like Matt Frewer,Lawrence Dane,Tara Strong,Valerie Mahaffey,Tommy Chong and Sergio Di Zio.Over all this movie was good and my rating is 6 out of 10.

    Having laughed my backside off while still in my teens, continued to laugh my cheeks off with each subsequent viewing in my twenties and now, at the ripe age of 36, having recently split my sides once more on the first viewing in nearly ten years, all I can conclude is that the viewers who conspired to rate Senior Trip (as i will always know it) so badly were clearly watching the wrong kind of film for them. It's perfectly casted, over-the-top, amusingly written and acted and ticks just about every box you want from an occasionally crass teen-comedy... in fact it ticks most boxes twice, and in bold. Do not let the score deceive you. Like Flight of The Living Dead, this is a film I have shared with at least twenty people over the years, of different ages, tastes, backgrounds, genders and religions - and I've not had a single negative response.

    The 'National Lampoon' series grinds on. Matt Frewer is a high school principal who assigns his degenerate pupils the detention project of writing a letter to the President explaining how the education system has failed them. The President is so impressed he invites them to Washington, so all the kids pile into a rickety bus and head off to the capital. This juvenile teen comedy manages to contain just about every genre stereotype - the fat slob, the cool joker, the prissy swot and so on - but it does raise a few laughs along the way, thanks in no small part to Frewer's manic performance, as opposed to, say, decent writing. Still, it's kind of fun and is by no means the worst of the series.

    This is the worst movie in America!!! I am guessing that the people who wrote great reviews on this were clearly under the influence of some heavy duty drugs. I have loved most of the National Lampoon's movies, but this one should not be associated with the classics. The writing is horrible. The acting is worse than spoof movies. Now I know these movies are to be silly and meant to be somewhat dumb. I get that, but there should be some decent scenes among all of the really stupid ones, which this movie only consists of. There are not any intelligent screen plays. The absurd man chasing the bus, is by far outrageous. It is ridiculous at best. Watch at your own risk.

    I love how you can spice up virtually anything by putting "National Lampoon's" in front of it. It may not mean anything because National Lampoon lends its name to everything that moves, but it always has a nice ring to it. If you can't think of a clever title for your movie, just say what it's about and put "National Lampoon's" in front, it always works. The movie itself well, it's nothing special. The same tired stereotypes you see in every college movie go on (you've guessed it) a senior trip to party and cause mayhem and just generally do things that you'd rather do than watch. Meanwhile a ridiculously one-dimensional principal tries to put a stop to this because well, just because. The jokes are pretty stale, and the characters are unlikeable, but I still enjoyed this movie for some reason. It's a pretty good compilation of clich&eacute;s I guess, its strength lies in its predictability. Also Tommy Chong appears, that always helps. Not the best college movie, but still easy to get through.

    Senior Trip (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Two stoners, wanting the best for their senior year, decide to throw a party at the house of their lamebrain principal but when the big guy catches him he decides to punish everyone there with Saturday detention. Those who got caught were the previously mentioned stoners, an overweight guy who is constantly eating something, the good girl virgin, the school slut, the black guy who wants to be Malcolm X plus a computer dork who enjoys reading Playboy magazine since he can't get a real woman. In the detention center the kids are made to write a letter to the President on the current state of education in America. Of course the smart girl ends up doing the report and it turns out that the letter actually makes it to the White House and the President decides to let the kids come to Washington so that they can introduce his new education bill. They've got two days to get to Washington and the road trip begins when Red (Tommy Chong), the horse pill popping bus driver shows up and declares the party official. The next two days are full of your typical sex and drugs but when the kids learn that they are just being used for political reasons, they decide to show that they aren't dumb after all. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is without a doubt one of the dumbest, most lame films ever made. Everything from the acting to the directing to the so-called screenplay are amateurish and perhaps that's being a bit too nice. There isn't a single original idea throughout the entire film and most of the time the film tries to go all out with over the top stereotypes as well as silly party scenes leading up to a so-called dramatic ending where the losers become winners. Every single scene in this film is something we've previously seen yet we're fortunate because the film is still pretty damn funny. The term so bad it's good certainly applies to this film. What makes this bad movie work is the effort that is obviously going on throughout it. You can tell that the actors are trying their best to recreate earlier teen films like National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's but they fail horribly in every sense yet them failing so badly is what gets a laugh from the viewer. We can look at all the stereotypes, which are seen the same way they were back in the 1980's. We've got the fat kid who does nothing in the movie except eat food. We get a dork who loves Playboy magazine yet fails to perform when a sex kitten offers him the time of his life. We get the good-girl virgin who deep down really wants to go wild with sex and alcohol. We got the bad boy who likes her and is willing to be a bit on the good side to get down her pants. We then get the dork teachers pet who deep down is a homosexual. The stereotypes themselves are very politically incorrect, which also adds to some of the charm. There's a hilarious, if stupid, scene where the teacher's pet is asked by the Principle for help and the guy gets down on his knees thinking that's the help needed. We get another scene where the overweight guy goes all out on his fantasy where he would have sex with a real Jap from China. We even get a nice porno take of Forrest Gump called Forrest Humps. If all of this sounds incredibly stupid, well it is and that's what makes the film funny. All of these jokes, as bad as they are, are being acted and directed as if they were the greatest comic lines ever written so we're left laughing at ourselves laughing at the film more than we're actually laughing at what's in the film. The biggest stab in the film goes towards Star Trek fans as one characters is so obsessed with the series that he goes all out (with his rubber sex partner) to destroy one of the senior members. There another politically incorrect scene where the Trek-nut kidnaps a Chinese family, which has to be seen to believe. Then there's the cameo by Tommy Chong, which while funny should have been a whole lot better. Sadly all the promos made it feel that he would have a large chunk in the film but he's in and out way too quickly but before he goes Chong delivers a few good pot jokes as well as a nice homage back to his days with Cheech. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is a very poor film but if you don't mind an offensive and lamebrain film then I'm sure you'll get enough chuckles out of it. You certainly shouldn't go into this thing expecting anything like Animal House and if you do you'll certainly be very disappointed. This is a very poorly made film that thankfully gets bad enough to get a few laughs. When I originally saw this in the theaters I was hoping this would be a return form to the good old days where teen comedies weren't rated PG-13 and didn't have a silly message to relay. There's no message here and the dirtiness certainly deserved the R-rating but by in large, the film is forgotten for a reason and I doubt a cult will ever pick up on it.

    On one level, this is a really horrible movie that tries to make heroes out of slackers, potheads and social rejects, but on another more subliminal level, the kids in this movie are like the largest comedy team ever seen. They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from "Star Trek" don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone: an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke clich&eacute; role he plays in every movie: a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of "Animal House," the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

We can look at all the stereotypes, which are seen the same way they were back in the 1980's. We've got the fat kid who does nothing in the movie except eat food. We get a dork who loves Playboy magazine yet fails to perform when a sex kitten offers him the time of his life. We get the good-girl virgin who deep down really wants to go wild with sex and alcohol. We got the bad boy who likes her and is willing to be a bit on the good side to get down her pants. We then get the dork teachers pet who deep down is a homosexual. The stereotypes themselves are very politically incorrect, which also adds to some of the charm. There's a hilarious, if stupid, scene where the teacher's pet is asked by the Principle for help and the guy gets down on his knees thinking that's the help needed. We get another scene where the overweight guy goes all out on his fantasy where he would have sex with a real Jap from China. We even get a nice porno take of Forrest Gump called Forrest Humps. If all of this sounds incredibly stupid, well it is and that's what makes the film funny. All of these jokes, as bad as they are, are being acted and directed as if they were the greatest comic lines ever written so we're left laughing at ourselves laughing at the film more than we're actually laughing at what's in the film. The biggest stab in the film goes towards Star Trek fans as one characters is so obsessed with the series that he goes all out (with his rubber sex partner) to destroy one of the senior members. There another politically incorrect scene where the Trek-nut kidnaps a Chinese family, which has to be seen to believe. Then there's the cameo by Tommy Chong, which while funny should have been a whole lot better. Sadly all the promos made it feel that he would have a large chunk in the film but he's in and out way too quickly but before he goes Chong delivers a few good pot jokes as well as a nice homage back to his days with Cheech. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is a very poor film but if you don't mind an offensive and lamebrain film then I'm sure you'll get enough chuckles out of it. You certainly shouldn't go into this thing expecting anything like Animal House and if you do you'll certainly be very disappointed. This is a very poorly made film that thankfully gets bad enough to get a few laughs. When I originally saw this in the theaters I was hoping this would be a return form to the good old days where teen comedies weren't rated PG-13 and didn't have a silly message to relay. There's no message here and the dirtiness certainly deserved the R-rating but by in large, the film is forgotten for a reason and I doubt a cult will ever pick up on it.

    On one level, this is a really horrible movie that tries to make heroes out of slackers, potheads and social rejects, but on another more subliminal level, the kids in this movie are like the largest comedy team ever seen. They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from "Star Trek" don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone: an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke clich&eacute; role he plays in every movie: a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of "Animal House," the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.

    I should say that "Senior Trip" is mostly one of the silly comedies that they released in the 1990s (of course, it was intended as such). I guess that on one level, it has an important lesson about paying attention to what happens in the government. In my opinion, the best parts were some of the briefer things: the guy chasing the bus, J. Edgar Hoover's grave*, the porno movie in the hotel room, and the epilogues. Otherwise, this isn't the sort of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch. Although I have to admit, Matt Frewer (who turns 50 today) and Tommy Chong play great characters. *The student was right: J. Edgar Hoover was a fascist. You may have heard the news that just recently came out that Hoover wanted to round up large numbers of Americans in 1950.

    I really wanted to like this movie, but I could only come up for 3 reasons to suggest anyone else endure this movie. Tommy Chong, Tara Strong and Nicole de Boer. Quite frankly, Chong isn't enough of a reason since he can be seen in better form in a dozen other choices and de Boer is a minor player at best. You are better off watching the last few seasons of Deep Space Nine to be mesmerized by Nicole. So that leaves us with Tara. Yes, Tara is enough of a reason to watch this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited. Tara on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous.

    Where did this movie go wrong? Where do I start? 1.) In being made by National Lampoon, it appeared to try way too hard to be "Animal House". There was a stupid fat guy, an uptight head of the school, a straight laced honor student, and the rest of the student got drunk and/or stoned. There was one militant black guy that would have made an interesting character, but his character was pushed to the back too often. Above all, you didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the main characters, which is why the movie didn't play out very well. 2.) The principal was unnecessarily stupid. When the "evil" senator threatened to have the principal revoked from his job, I didn't blame him. The principal character should have been the moral center of the story, the only sane person in an insane situation. That kind of situation makes for uproarious laughter, and it's something the writers, not to mention the actor who played him, should have taken into account. 3.) The title of the movie didn't fit. Yes the students were seniors, and yes they were going on a trip, making the title "Senior Trip" sound obvious enough. However, the title made you think that every senior was going on this trip, which was not true. Plus, the students didn't embark on the trip until halfway through the movie, since the premise took too long to extrapolate before the movie's main premise got underway. In my opinion, the beginning scene with the "High On Life" band was completely unnecessary, not to mention not funny. I'm not a stoner, and I would have booed that band. 4.) The movie employed too many movie clich&eacute;s which weighed down the potential hilarity of the movie, from the uptight teacher getting her hands on alcohol to the undeserved slow clapping to the unnecessary epilogue at the end of the movie. One could argue that it was parodying other movies, but this movie didn't appear to parody anything. 5.) Kevin McDonald. Simply putting him in any movie is a bad idea. Sure he was funny when he was with the Kids In The Hall, but nearly every movie he has been in has sucked, from "The Godson" to "The Ladies Man" to this movie. Plus, his character wasn't necessary to the movie, and you had no clue why he was chasing these kids to D.C. other than the fact that he had nothing better to do. If there is a plus side to his character, it reminds you that hardcore Trekkies are too damn annoying to function properly in today's society. I did buy this movie for $8.00 in a special "Double Feature" edition with "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1" on the other side of the disc. At least four of my dollars didn't go to waste.

    Before i watched this movie i thought that it would suck but this movie turned out to be good and the movies about how some high school students are in detention and they write a letter to the President about what is wrong with the education system and the President reads it and he likes it and then he asks them to come to Washington to met him.There are some funny scenes in this movie like how one of the students farts in front of a fire setting some one on fire and all of the party scenes.This movie stars actors and actress like Matt Frewer,Lawrence Dane,Tara Strong,Valerie Mahaffey,Tommy Chong and Sergio Di Zio.Over all this movie was good and my rating is 6 out of 10.

    Having laughed my backside off while still in my teens, continued to laugh my cheeks off with each subsequent viewing in my twenties and now, at the ripe age of 36, having recently split my sides once more on the first viewing in nearly ten years, all I can conclude is that the viewers who conspired to rate Senior Trip (as i will always know it) so badly were clearly watching the wrong kind of film for them. It's perfectly casted, over-the-top, amusingly written and acted and ticks just about every box you want from an occasionally crass teen-comedy... in fact it ticks most boxes twice, and in bold. Do not let the score deceive you. Like Flight of The Living Dead, this is a film I have shared with at least twenty people over the years, of different ages, tastes, backgrounds, genders and religions - and I've not had a single negative response.

    The 'National Lampoon' series grinds on. Matt Frewer is a high school principal who assigns his degenerate pupils the detention project of writing a letter to the President explaining how the education system has failed them. The President is so impressed he invites them to Washington, so all the kids pile into a rickety bus and head off to the capital. This juvenile teen comedy manages to contain just about every genre stereotype - the fat slob, the cool joker, the prissy swot and so on - but it does raise a few laughs along the way, thanks in no small part to Frewer's manic performance, as opposed to, say, decent writing. Still, it's kind of fun and is by no means the worst of the series.

    This is the worst movie in America!!! I am guessing that the people who wrote great reviews on this were clearly under the influence of some heavy duty drugs. I have loved most of the National Lampoon's movies, but this one should not be associated with the classics. The writing is horrible. The acting is worse than spoof movies. Now I know these movies are to be silly and meant to be somewhat dumb. I get that, but there should be some decent scenes among all of the really stupid ones, which this movie only consists of. There are not any intelligent screen plays. The absurd man chasing the bus, is by far outrageous. It is ridiculous at best. Watch at your own risk.

    I love how you can spice up virtually anything by putting "National Lampoon's" in front of it. It may not mean anything because National Lampoon lends its name to everything that moves, but it always has a nice ring to it. If you can't think of a clever title for your movie, just say what it's about and put "National Lampoon's" in front, it always works. The movie itself well, it's nothing special. The same tired stereotypes you see in every college movie go on (you've guessed it) a senior trip to party and cause mayhem and just generally do things that you'd rather do than watch. Meanwhile a ridiculously one-dimensional principal tries to put a stop to this because well, just because. The jokes are pretty stale, and the characters are unlikeable, but I still enjoyed this movie for some reason. It's a pretty good compilation of clich&eacute;s I guess, its strength lies in its predictability. Also Tommy Chong appears, that always helps. Not the best college movie, but still easy to get through.

    Senior Trip (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Two stoners, wanting the best for their senior year, decide to throw a party at the house of their lamebrain principal but when the big guy catches him he decides to punish everyone there with Saturday detention. Those who got caught were the previously mentioned stoners, an overweight guy who is constantly eating something, the good girl virgin, the school slut, the black guy who wants to be Malcolm X plus a computer dork who enjoys reading Playboy magazine since he can't get a real woman. In the detention center the kids are made to write a letter to the President on the current state of education in America. Of course the smart girl ends up doing the report and it turns out that the letter actually makes it to the White House and the President decides to let the kids come to Washington so that they can introduce his new education bill. They've got two days to get to Washington and the road trip begins when Red (Tommy Chong), the horse pill popping bus driver shows up and declares the party official. The next two days are full of your typical sex and drugs but when the kids learn that they are just being used for political reasons, they decide to show that they aren't dumb after all. National Lampoon's Senior Trip is without a doubt one of the dumbest, most lame films ever made. Everything from the acting to the directing to the so-called screenplay are amateurish and perhaps that's being a bit too nice. There isn't a single original idea throughout the entire film and most of the time the film tries to go all out with over the top stereotypes as well as silly party scenes leading up to a so-called dramatic ending where the losers become winners. Every single scene in this film is something we've previously seen yet we're fortunate because the film is still pretty damn funny. The term so bad it's good certainly applies to this film. What makes this bad movie work is the effort that is obviously going on throughout it. You can tell that the actors are trying their best to recreate earlier teen films like National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's but they fail horribly in every sense yet them failing so badly is what gets a laugh from the viewer. We can look at all the stereotypes, which are seen the same way they were back in the 1980's. We've got the fat kid who does nothing in the movie except eat food. We get a dork who loves Playboy magazine yet fails to perform when a sex kitten offers him the time of his life. We get the good-girl virgin who deep down really wants to go wild with sex and alcohol. We got the bad boy who likes her and is willing to be a bit on the good side to get down her pants. We then get the dork teachers pet who deep down is a homosexual. The stereotypes themselves are very politically incorrect, which also adds to some of the charm. There's a hilarious, if stupid, scene where the teacher's pet is asked by the Principle for help and the guy gets down on his knees thinking that's the help needed. We get another scene where the overweight guy goes all out on his fantasy where he would have sex with a real Jap from China. We even get a nice porno take of Forrest Gump called Forrest Humps. If all of this sounds incredibly stupid, well it is and that's what makes the film funny. All of these jokes, as bad as they are, are being acted and directed as if they were the greatest comic lines ever written so we're left laughing at ourselves laughing at the film more than we're actually laughing at what's in the film. The biggest stab in the film goes towards Star Trek fans as one characters is so obsessed with the series that he goes all out (with his rubber sex partner) to destroy one of the senior members. There another politically incorrect scene where the Trek-nut kidnaps a Chinese family, which has to be seen to believe.
