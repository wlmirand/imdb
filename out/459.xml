    ...either to read the book (which I highly recommend), or to view the film. Aside from being a real history lesson, this story is an excellent portrayal of shared loss and empathy. It's a heartbreaking tale of tragedies that have played themselves out in South Africa for decades. It's also a tale of incredible goodness, of major gaps between races overcome, of triumph over devastating loss. I don't know how anyone could read this book or see this film and ever be able to forget the experience. I think James Earl Jones and Richard Harris brought incredible realism and poignancy to the story of Rev. Kumalo, James Jarvis, and their fallen sons. Keep the hankies close.

    With this film, I am pleased to say, they (the producers/director/actors) finally got one right: South Africa, caught in the throes of a growing racial divide already had much to atone for. Sooneror later, justice had to prevail. And it did, though much later and at great cost in the innocent lives lost. The film's setting is Natal Province, South Africa during the early apartheid era. Albeit 'the separation of the races' was not officially sanctioned by the state at that time. Still, the prejudice against the blacks was practiced by practically all of the foreign settlers. It didn't matter whether you were of British descent or of Boer blood. The 'pecking order' with whites atop of the ladder had to be maintained. And it was preserved with little or no regard to the loss of human dignity and lives. Richard Harris delivers an outstanding performance as James Jarvis. He's a wealthy white landowner. To his family and peers, Jarvis is more than respected. He's revered. To his workers, especially the African natives he's feared. They all call him 'Baas Man'. That title says it all. On the other side of the racial divide, we encounter Rev. Stephen Kumalo. Make no mistake: James Earl Jones portrayal of the quiet man was so intense yet sensitive it almost moved me to tears. In fact, it did on at least two occasions, maybe more. Although they live in the same remote rural community, the two respective leaders of their 'volk or tribe' rarely if ever have met even in public. Soon, that would change. In Joburg, the largest city and also the commercial hub of the Republic, a gruesome murder has taken place. This random act of violence though unbeknown to either Jarvis or the Reverend Kumalo, will ultimately unite the two disparate men. They both would suffer the loss of a son: Jarvis through murder, and Kumalo through capital punishment. No doubt, nothing short of a cruel fate was necessary to draw both men closer to themselves and eventually each other. Now as a citizen living abroad, after having sojourned in the Republik for many years, I will say I was deeply moved by each man's journey. Save the political message (way too much liberalism) I believe the film first and foremost conveyed a single, laudable tenet: as human beings, we owe it to God to walk in our neighbor's shoes even though we've grown so comfortable in our own, 'private' space. By Jove, this film achieved just that emotive plane. And thank Almighty God too for inspiring Alan Paton's novel of the same title as well. Moreover, I am certain the silver screen adaptation did the author, the beloved country and the characters much righteous justice.

    (The 1995 film) Stars: James Earl Jones, Richard Harris. Plot: A rural, black Anglican priest ("The Rev. Kumalo"/Jones) in 1940s apartheid South Africa searches for his son, Absalom, who'd gone to Johannesburg and stopped contacting his family. Kumalo eventually finds Absalom and his pregnant girlfriend--but also that Absalom's being charged with murdering a young white man ("Jarvis") who was very active in helping blacks and opposing apartheid ("apartheid" translation = "aparthood"). The film is based on Alan Paton's VERY influential 1948 novel of the same name (& banned in South Africa for many decades). Paton's book helped foster civil rights changes in the USA as well as the many diplomatic pressures that pressured an end to apartheid (1948-94) in South Africa. "Cry, the Beloved Country" has been published in 20 different languages; 1 Broadway play & 3 films have been based on it. ((For those interested, the cliffsnotes study guide for "Cry the Beloved County" has an excellent, quite succinct (IMO) history (1600-2000) of the dynamics & conflicts of the various ethnicities, races, nationalities, etc., that led to apartheid and its dissolution: http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/cry-beloved- country.html)) Paton was a devout Anglican (AKA Episcopalian in the USA) South African who strongly opposed apartheid as did a number of other South African people and denominations (e.g., Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc.; but altogether, these denominations were a political minority). While the film narrative closely follows Paton's book, for some (IMO), it will be more interesting as a glimpse back at those times rather than as a highly interesting story apart on its own. The plot is essentially a modern day morality play in which 2 major protagonists: the black Rev. Kumalo represents conflicts of Christian ideals and human feelings vs. the wealthy white landowner's, Jarvis's father (Harris), desire to preserve apartheid ("aparthood"=segregation) but with his own conflicts. A significant, slightly lesser figure is the Rev. Kumalo's brother who takes a political, NON-religious stance (opposed to his brother's faith-based position) exhorting blacks to oppose & subvert privileged whites who keep blacks permanently disenfranchised and in extremely inferior status. Paton's book also served as the basis for Kurt Weill's & Maxwell Anderson's Broadway musical "Lost in the Stars" (it ran 1949-50; '58; '72; I saw it & loved it). The stage musical simplifies the novel's plot but adds Weill's great music and Anderson's great dialog while staying very true to Paton's book. ((There's also a 1974 AFT film "version" of this musical. It's not so much like traditional Hollywood musicals in which narrative actions pause for singing since, in this, the songs seem so integral to the narrative's development. And SOME emotional interactions are more intense (IMO) than in the '95 "Cry, the Beloved Country" film. BUT in this musical film version--inexplicably, sadly--the concluding emotional reconciliation between the two fathers who lost their sons (in the book, the stage version, and this film) is quite diminished and almost totally absent.)) Paton's book (& its derived Broadway musical) helped provide impetus for American civil rights marches (1950s-60s) in which many other Episcopalian college students & I participated--so seeing this film brought back many stirring and fond memories. My ratings: 10 (of 10) for its representation of this era's events and the book but 7 (of 10) for entertainment.

    I know most readers won't find my comments useful, but here goes anyway. I saw this movie a long long time ago but recently went looking for it on IMDb (not sure why), probably to look up snippets about Richard Harris. What I remember most about the movie was 1) the incredible cinematography - no denying that African countryside is gorgeous, and 2) the one long extended scene between James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. I don't even remember most of the dialogue, only that these two great classically-trained actors almost literally chewed the scenery. I remember that the scene was calmly played, yet both actors simmered with just-perceptible passion. I once performed in the Kurt Weill opera of the same name. I'm accustomed to having music propel me through the story, but I didn't miss it in this movie. One casting note - probably because of recent trends in NTC (non-traditional casting), most stage shows refer to the racial divide in the opera as "whites" and "coloreds," which, under apartheid, included all non-whites. Whether or not this was intentionally done by the librettist, it gives opera companies the freedom to hire Asian-Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans (or Europeans) as the "colored" cast. In the movie, it was starkly white and black. Nevertheless, if you lack any other reason for seeing the movie, see it for the wonderful performances of Jones and Harris.

    Certainly not horrible, but definitely not good. Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer/landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect. I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means. Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I guess it wasn't that bad, --Five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. Both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. The music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much. The last, striking words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film. Thanks for your time.

    I read CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY in high school, and was quite impressed by it's dignified and somber retelling of the tragedy of modern South Africa under the apartheid system that was in place at the time. Alan Paton had a literary and political career in the Union of South Africa, and was opposed to the system that kept down the native Black Africans while the native white Africans ruled them. His novel was quite shocking in his home country, and led to his being forbidden to be published there. Now he seems remarkably prescient. The novel was made into a film in 1951, which I never saw. But I have finally seen this version today and while it whittles down the plot a bit, it's emphasis on the dual tragedy of the Kumalo and Jarvis families actually enhances the effect. James Earl Jones plays Rev. Stephen Kumalo, an honorable man from the countryside who goes to Johannisburg to find his son Absolom. From the start we see contrasts. The beauties and glories of the magnificent veld v. the dirt and grime of the city. The large home of the Jarvis family as opposed to the poor homes of Rev. Kumalo. Rev. Kumalo goes to an address in one of the slums of Johannisburg that the Blacks were forced to live in. He tries to trace his son, with the assistance of a fellow minister, Rev. Msimangu ( Vasi Kunene) and gets less helpful assistance from his brother John Kumalo (Charles S. Dutton). The latter is a local politician, but is soon revealed to be an opportunist and crook. Eventually Rev. Kumalo finds his son has been in trouble with the police, and recently released from a reformatory. This was due to Absolom having a pregnant girlfriend. The Reverend traces his son to the girlfriend, but she has not heard from him for a few days. The next thing that the Reverend hears is that Absolom and two others (including the son of John Kumalo) were involved in a burglary murder that resulted in the death of Ian Jarvis. Tom Jarvis, long used to accept the harsh separation of the races as natural, comes to a stunning discovery - his son's posthumous condemnation of the social system of South Africa as one to abhor as it breeds crime and hatred. The discovery of this side to his son leads him to slowly find a bridge uniting him with Rev. Kumalo, as they both find the system destroy their boys. One has to see the film to understand this bridging of the the lives of the fathers (ironically neighbors who rarely knew each other or each other's families in the "normal" period). One also sees the warning that Paton instilled in his readers: Rev. Msimangu's fear that when the White race finally turns to love the Black race will only accept hate. Much is dropped of the four hundred fifty page novel, such as Paton's ritualistic use of descriptions again and again (which can't be translated to film successfully) or plot threads regarding the final break between the Reverend and his brother John, or the Reverend trying to trace other lost children from the town (one is mentioned briefly). But the somberness of the tragedy of Absolom, who with Ian become joint blood sacrifices to a racist state is total. The performances of Jones and Harris are equally effective. Altogether a first rate film version of the novel.

    Since i am South African, this movie has significant meaning. while it is not many viewers' drama of choice, it does show the result of extreme contrasts. Alan Paton was heavily criticized for this novel simply because they believed the change in Jarvis was so drastic that it did not have much realism. We do however have to ask ourselves whether 'realism' was a more significant theme than 'change'. I think it is probable that the novel and movie were designed to inspire 'change' rather than document it. To those who have yet to see it i encourage you to do so. If you are able to view it from a South African perspective (who i might add are among the most patriotic on the planet) it is an excellent film.

    Emily, a senior, is reading the book as an assignment for her English class. We watched to movie on VHS, as part of her getting extra credit. She hadn't finished the book yet, but commented that much of the movie was directly out of the book, so I suspect overall it is faithful to its source. James Earl Jones is Rev Stephen Kumalo, living in the country, and goes to Johannesburg to find his son and a young woman. Much of the first half of the movie can be bordering on boring as the characters are established. Richard Harris is wealthy white James Jarvis, who also lives in the country near Kumalo. They have seen each other, but do not actually know each other. Jarvis also has a son, who is in Johannesburg, and works with the poor, even the poor blacks, in a life that the elder Jarvis doesn't quite understand. He still subscribes to the idea that "they have their place and we have ours", apartheid. The movie is competently done, with competent acting, but comes across as a simple, no-frills movie. The message is important, but the movie itself is rather bland. SPOILERS. Jarvis's son turns up dead, murdered by three black men who are in his home to rob him. The shooter is Kumalo's son, who confesses, but says he was scared, didn't mean to kill anyone. After a trial the son is found guilty and sentenced to hang. On the day of the hanging, the dad goes up to the mountain to reflect, and Jarvis meets him there. Through this tragedy both men come to appreciate each other, and the need for healing amongst the blacks and whites in S. Africa.

    i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and am using it as the basis for my human geography paper on Class issues of the 'new' south Africa. i am south African but live in new Zealand now as a result of apartheid. James Earl Jones is amazing as rev Khumalo, very believable how a man so strong can at times look so powerless in this role of a father who can do nothing. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Jarvis, fantastic acting. I was surprised that most of the movie was shot in Cape Town, although i might be mistaken as the video that i watched was poor quality. Amazing to compare something set in 1946 and to realize that not much has changed, REALLY, but that , even then there were opportunities to break the barrier that humans created. Loved the movie,

    This is an exceptionally good rendering of Alan Paton's timeless novel. Turning such a book into a film is always fraught with challenges, but this one succeeds admirably in capturing both the story and the almost biblical tone of Paton's writing. If the language of the novel moved you, this film will too. James Earl Jones seems at first to be an unlikely Stephen Kumalo, but, like Richard Harris as Jarvis, Snr, he both captures and enriches the character. These feel like real people. Watch this film bearing in mind that the novel was written in the 1940s, and much of it becomes truly prophetic - not least the suggestion that Aparteid's architects and enforcers would be consigned "to the sewers of history." Highly recommended.

In the movie, it was starkly white and black. Nevertheless, if you lack any other reason for seeing the movie, see it for the wonderful performances of Jones and Harris.

    Certainly not horrible, but definitely not good. Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer/landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect. I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means. Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I guess it wasn't that bad, --Five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. Both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. The music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much. The last, striking words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film. Thanks for your time.

    I read CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY in high school, and was quite impressed by it's dignified and somber retelling of the tragedy of modern South Africa under the apartheid system that was in place at the time. Alan Paton had a literary and political career in the Union of South Africa, and was opposed to the system that kept down the native Black Africans while the native white Africans ruled them. His novel was quite shocking in his home country, and led to his being forbidden to be published there. Now he seems remarkably prescient. The novel was made into a film in 1951, which I never saw. But I have finally seen this version today and while it whittles down the plot a bit, it's emphasis on the dual tragedy of the Kumalo and Jarvis families actually enhances the effect. James Earl Jones plays Rev. Stephen Kumalo, an honorable man from the countryside who goes to Johannisburg to find his son Absolom. From the start we see contrasts. The beauties and glories of the magnificent veld v. the dirt and grime of the city. The large home of the Jarvis family as opposed to the poor homes of Rev. Kumalo. Rev. Kumalo goes to an address in one of the slums of Johannisburg that the Blacks were forced to live in. He tries to trace his son, with the assistance of a fellow minister, Rev. Msimangu ( Vasi Kunene) and gets less helpful assistance from his brother John Kumalo (Charles S. Dutton). The latter is a local politician, but is soon revealed to be an opportunist and crook. Eventually Rev. Kumalo finds his son has been in trouble with the police, and recently released from a reformatory. This was due to Absolom having a pregnant girlfriend. The Reverend traces his son to the girlfriend, but she has not heard from him for a few days. The next thing that the Reverend hears is that Absolom and two others (including the son of John Kumalo) were involved in a burglary murder that resulted in the death of Ian Jarvis. Tom Jarvis, long used to accept the harsh separation of the races as natural, comes to a stunning discovery - his son's posthumous condemnation of the social system of South Africa as one to abhor as it breeds crime and hatred. The discovery of this side to his son leads him to slowly find a bridge uniting him with Rev. Kumalo, as they both find the system destroy their boys. One has to see the film to understand this bridging of the the lives of the fathers (ironically neighbors who rarely knew each other or each other's families in the "normal" period). One also sees the warning that Paton instilled in his readers: Rev. Msimangu's fear that when the White race finally turns to love the Black race will only accept hate. Much is dropped of the four hundred fifty page novel, such as Paton's ritualistic use of descriptions again and again (which can't be translated to film successfully) or plot threads regarding the final break between the Reverend and his brother John, or the Reverend trying to trace other lost children from the town (one is mentioned briefly). But the somberness of the tragedy of Absolom, who with Ian become joint blood sacrifices to a racist state is total. The performances of Jones and Harris are equally effective. Altogether a first rate film version of the novel.

    Since i am South African, this movie has significant meaning. while it is not many viewers' drama of choice, it does show the result of extreme contrasts. Alan Paton was heavily criticized for this novel simply because they believed the change in Jarvis was so drastic that it did not have much realism. We do however have to ask ourselves whether 'realism' was a more significant theme than 'change'. I think it is probable that the novel and movie were designed to inspire 'change' rather than document it. To those who have yet to see it i encourage you to do so. If you are able to view it from a South African perspective (who i might add are among the most patriotic on the planet) it is an excellent film.

    Emily, a senior, is reading the book as an assignment for her English class. We watched to movie on VHS, as part of her getting extra credit. She hadn't finished the book yet, but commented that much of the movie was directly out of the book, so I suspect overall it is faithful to its source. James Earl Jones is Rev Stephen Kumalo, living in the country, and goes to Johannesburg to find his son and a young woman. Much of the first half of the movie can be bordering on boring as the characters are established. Richard Harris is wealthy white James Jarvis, who also lives in the country near Kumalo. They have seen each other, but do not actually know each other. Jarvis also has a son, who is in Johannesburg, and works with the poor, even the poor blacks, in a life that the elder Jarvis doesn't quite understand. He still subscribes to the idea that "they have their place and we have ours", apartheid. The movie is competently done, with competent acting, but comes across as a simple, no-frills movie. The message is important, but the movie itself is rather bland. SPOILERS. Jarvis's son turns up dead, murdered by three black men who are in his home to rob him. The shooter is Kumalo's son, who confesses, but says he was scared, didn't mean to kill anyone. After a trial the son is found guilty and sentenced to hang. On the day of the hanging, the dad goes up to the mountain to reflect, and Jarvis meets him there. Through this tragedy both men come to appreciate each other, and the need for healing amongst the blacks and whites in S. Africa.

    i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and am using it as the basis for my human geography paper on Class issues of the 'new' south Africa. i am south African but live in new Zealand now as a result of apartheid. James Earl Jones is amazing as rev Khumalo, very believable how a man so strong can at times look so powerless in this role of a father who can do nothing. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Jarvis, fantastic acting. I was surprised that most of the movie was shot in Cape Town, although i might be mistaken as the video that i watched was poor quality. Amazing to compare something set in 1946 and to realize that not much has changed, REALLY, but that , even then there were opportunities to break the barrier that humans created. Loved the movie,

    This is an exceptionally good rendering of Alan Paton's timeless novel. Turning such a book into a film is always fraught with challenges, but this one succeeds admirably in capturing both the story and the almost biblical tone of Paton's writing. If the language of the novel moved you, this film will too. James Earl Jones seems at first to be an unlikely Stephen Kumalo, but, like Richard Harris as Jarvis, Snr, he both captures and enriches the character. These feel like real people. Watch this film bearing in mind that the novel was written in the 1940s, and much of it becomes truly prophetic - not least the suggestion that Aparteid's architects and enforcers would be consigned "to the sewers of history." Highly recommended.

    ...either to read the book (which I highly recommend), or to view the film. Aside from being a real history lesson, this story is an excellent portrayal of shared loss and empathy. It's a heartbreaking tale of tragedies that have played themselves out in South Africa for decades. It's also a tale of incredible goodness, of major gaps between races overcome, of triumph over devastating loss. I don't know how anyone could read this book or see this film and ever be able to forget the experience. I think James Earl Jones and Richard Harris brought incredible realism and poignancy to the story of Rev. Kumalo, James Jarvis, and their fallen sons. Keep the hankies close.

    With this film, I am pleased to say, they (the producers/director/actors) finally got one right: South Africa, caught in the throes of a growing racial divide already had much to atone for. Sooneror later, justice had to prevail. And it did, though much later and at great cost in the innocent lives lost. The film's setting is Natal Province, South Africa during the early apartheid era. Albeit 'the separation of the races' was not officially sanctioned by the state at that time. Still, the prejudice against the blacks was practiced by practically all of the foreign settlers. It didn't matter whether you were of British descent or of Boer blood. The 'pecking order' with whites atop of the ladder had to be maintained. And it was preserved with little or no regard to the loss of human dignity and lives. Richard Harris delivers an outstanding performance as James Jarvis. He's a wealthy white landowner. To his family and peers, Jarvis is more than respected. He's revered. To his workers, especially the African natives he's feared. They all call him 'Baas Man'. That title says it all. On the other side of the racial divide, we encounter Rev. Stephen Kumalo. Make no mistake: James Earl Jones portrayal of the quiet man was so intense yet sensitive it almost moved me to tears. In fact, it did on at least two occasions, maybe more. Although they live in the same remote rural community, the two respective leaders of their 'volk or tribe' rarely if ever have met even in public. Soon, that would change. In Joburg, the largest city and also the commercial hub of the Republic, a gruesome murder has taken place. This random act of violence though unbeknown to either Jarvis or the Reverend Kumalo, will ultimately unite the two disparate men. They both would suffer the loss of a son: Jarvis through murder, and Kumalo through capital punishment. No doubt, nothing short of a cruel fate was necessary to draw both men closer to themselves and eventually each other. Now as a citizen living abroad, after having sojourned in the Republik for many years, I will say I was deeply moved by each man's journey. Save the political message (way too much liberalism) I believe the film first and foremost conveyed a single, laudable tenet: as human beings, we owe it to God to walk in our neighbor's shoes even though we've grown so comfortable in our own, 'private' space. By Jove, this film achieved just that emotive plane. And thank Almighty God too for inspiring Alan Paton's novel of the same title as well. Moreover, I am certain the silver screen adaptation did the author, the beloved country and the characters much righteous justice.

    (The 1995 film) Stars: James Earl Jones, Richard Harris. Plot: A rural, black Anglican priest ("The Rev. Kumalo"/Jones) in 1940s apartheid South Africa searches for his son, Absalom, who'd gone to Johannesburg and stopped contacting his family. Kumalo eventually finds Absalom and his pregnant girlfriend--but also that Absalom's being charged with murdering a young white man ("Jarvis") who was very active in helping blacks and opposing apartheid ("apartheid" translation = "aparthood"). The film is based on Alan Paton's VERY influential 1948 novel of the same name (& banned in South Africa for many decades). Paton's book helped foster civil rights changes in the USA as well as the many diplomatic pressures that pressured an end to apartheid (1948-94) in South Africa. "Cry, the Beloved Country" has been published in 20 different languages; 1 Broadway play & 3 films have been based on it. ((For those interested, the cliffsnotes study guide for "Cry the Beloved County" has an excellent, quite succinct (IMO) history (1600-2000) of the dynamics & conflicts of the various ethnicities, races, nationalities, etc., that led to apartheid and its dissolution: http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/cry-beloved- country.html)) Paton was a devout Anglican (AKA Episcopalian in the USA) South African who strongly opposed apartheid as did a number of other South African people and denominations (e.g., Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc.; but altogether, these denominations were a political minority). While the film narrative closely follows Paton's book, for some (IMO), it will be more interesting as a glimpse back at those times rather than as a highly interesting story apart on its own. The plot is essentially a modern day morality play in which 2 major protagonists: the black Rev. Kumalo represents conflicts of Christian ideals and human feelings vs. the wealthy white landowner's, Jarvis's father (Harris), desire to preserve apartheid ("aparthood"=segregation) but with his own conflicts. A significant, slightly lesser figure is the Rev. Kumalo's brother who takes a political, NON-religious stance (opposed to his brother's faith-based position) exhorting blacks to oppose & subvert privileged whites who keep blacks permanently disenfranchised and in extremely inferior status. Paton's book also served as the basis for Kurt Weill's & Maxwell Anderson's Broadway musical "Lost in the Stars" (it ran 1949-50; '58; '72; I saw it & loved it). The stage musical simplifies the novel's plot but adds Weill's great music and Anderson's great dialog while staying very true to Paton's book. ((There's also a 1974 AFT film "version" of this musical. It's not so much like traditional Hollywood musicals in which narrative actions pause for singing since, in this, the songs seem so integral to the narrative's development. And SOME emotional interactions are more intense (IMO) than in the '95 "Cry, the Beloved Country" film. BUT in this musical film version--inexplicably, sadly--the concluding emotional reconciliation between the two fathers who lost their sons (in the book, the stage version, and this film) is quite diminished and almost totally absent.)) Paton's book (& its derived Broadway musical) helped provide impetus for American civil rights marches (1950s-60s) in which many other Episcopalian college students & I participated--so seeing this film brought back many stirring and fond memories. My ratings: 10 (of 10) for its representation of this era's events and the book but 7 (of 10) for entertainment.

    I know most readers won't find my comments useful, but here goes anyway. I saw this movie a long long time ago but recently went looking for it on IMDb (not sure why), probably to look up snippets about Richard Harris. What I remember most about the movie was 1) the incredible cinematography - no denying that African countryside is gorgeous, and 2) the one long extended scene between James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. I don't even remember most of the dialogue, only that these two great classically-trained actors almost literally chewed the scenery. I remember that the scene was calmly played, yet both actors simmered with just-perceptible passion. I once performed in the Kurt Weill opera of the same name. I'm accustomed to having music propel me through the story, but I didn't miss it in this movie. One casting note - probably because of recent trends in NTC (non-traditional casting), most stage shows refer to the racial divide in the opera as "whites" and "coloreds," which, under apartheid, included all non-whites. Whether or not this was intentionally done by the librettist, it gives opera companies the freedom to hire Asian-Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans (or Europeans) as the "colored" cast. In the movie, it was starkly white and black. Nevertheless, if you lack any other reason for seeing the movie, see it for the wonderful performances of Jones and Harris.

James Earl Jones seems at first to be an unlikely Stephen Kumalo, but, like Richard Harris as Jarvis, Snr, he both captures and enriches the character. These feel like real people. Watch this film bearing in mind that the novel was written in the 1940s, and much of it becomes truly prophetic - not least the suggestion that Aparteid's architects and enforcers would be consigned "to the sewers of history." Highly recommended.
