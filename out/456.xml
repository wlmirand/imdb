    I actually like all of the films that Chris Farley made. It was tragic that he passed away, he's one of the funniest people I've seen. I heard he actually hated this movie upon release, but I love this one and I laugh every time I watch it. Farley was a great comedian and always funny. I like everything about this movie, even Chris Tucker is funny in this, but the real gold is Farley. This movie has some of my favorite physical stunts. I guess Farley was depressed and thought that he wasn't funny, that we was just the big dumb fat guy who always fell down. I've seen a lot of his films, and he's not that kind of person, he's the smart guy who always had a temper, but he was always funny. He's one of the funniest people I've seen and he's actually a favorite actor of mine. This film has such funny dialogue and any any aspiring actor should take care of how Farley performed his facial features and reactions, which are always priceless. It's just a shame that he's no longer with us, RIP Chris Farley.

    If you like Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and The Time of Their Lives, then you should like this movie. It's sad what happened to Farley, because he inherited that brand of comedy. Probably no one will be able to do comedy just like Lou Costello, but it would have been fun to see Chris Farley remake a couple of those movies. It's also sad he didn't like the movie - it entertained a lot of people. He could act as well, and I can understand wanting to branch out, but I hope he and everyone else had fun making this movie. I would hope Robin Shou had a blast. He inherited the Abbott role, and he did great. Everyone else did a fine job with what they had.

    The Late Chris Farley, is the main reason why you should watch 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. Farley's films have always been comedies. Right from the cult-classic 'Tommy boy, to 'Black sheep', 'Almost Heroes' and 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. And in all those films, he has excelled. 'Beverly Hills Ninja' tells the story of Haru, played by Farley, who was found by a clan of ninjas as an infant in an abandoned treasure chest and was raised by them. He never quite conforms to their culture and never acquires the skills of a ninja, but is nonetheless good-natured and persevering in his personal ambitions. His first mission brings him to Beverly Hills to investigate a recent murder. Now, if your a person who only enjoys 'Intelligent' & 'Real' Cinema, I'd say, Do Not watch this comedy. It's not meant for you. But for those, who admire comedy to the fullest, should not miss this. Sure, some jokes are kiddish, but some jokes, especially towards the finale, manage to bring in laughs. Dennis Dugan has the directed the film fairly. Acting wise: It's Farley who really owns the film. He excels and comes across as cute and soft. If Farley lived more, I am sure, he would have gone a legend. Miss you Farley!

    This movie took classic jokes but put them into suck odd places it makes them feel new. So the general plot is that Haru is a baby found on the shore of japan. An old legend of a foreign boy. now for the first time (or at least from the movies I've seen) They had a incorrect "Legend". This movie took classic jokes to new levels. This movie was great and I think that it was a great movie for a quick laugh! now onto the cons. -as it did have some jokes that felt new, others were just the same old ones from about every other movie that used them. Finally is that sometimes everything had the worst luck, I know this is a common element in comedy's but it's really getting old. But overall this is a great movie!

    Beverly Hills Ninja is a great comedy movie. Even if the plot could be retarded for some viewers, but for me it is very good because Beverly Hills Ninja was mainly on comedy. Chris Farley made a great on his role. Haru who should have been the greatest white ninja like the passage in the ninja scripture, but he wasn't. He grew as the dumb and dopey ninja which made his master and his (highly respected) brother in trouble. Farley acted himself like a false guy from god which I am very pleased on him. I was very surprised that he hated his movie when he saw at first time, maybe he didn't like how he act in the movie. But for me, his acting was very perfect and he should be respected as the great comedian. The plot maybe looked easy for someone but I don't think so. Beverly Hills Ninja has a very good and reasonable plot. The production also great too, the movie's crew showed everyone that its comedy movie could had the great graphic, special effects and cinematography. For the summary, Beverly Hills Ninja should be one of the greatest comedy movie. Everything was great and everyone should buy or rent this movie if you want to find some kind of fun!

    The date : Friday, September 18, 1998. The place : Cairo. The happening : I made an appointment with 2 of my friends at 9: 45 AM near one of the biggest theaters downtown. This very cinema used to show every Friday's morning a movie for kids. Although me so my friends were in our early 20s but we managed to go in anyway. Because I'm the one who came up with this peerless suggestion, one of my friends told me he's worried about watching a movie among all-children-audience, but for experienced viewer like me who has been there more than once at many Fridays before, I made it clear that it's a real treat, and how the most annoying child is more quiet than any vexatious stupid who loves to crack jokes while the watching. The sight inside the cinema was fabulous; the kids were playing with their parents, the only echoes you hear were for laughs, till the lights went off, and the movie began, then the tranquility ruled. From the first minute he appeared (Chris Farley) captured the kids' hearts, so ours too. The movie's atmosphere, image, and fast pace made it a lovely cartoon. There was a funny moment every moment. The hot reactions of the kids and their thunderous laughs moved me in a way I can't forget. The strip club brief scene made one of my friends eye-popping, jaw-dropping and losing his capacity of talking, yet in a good way. But as for me, one of the top reasons that pushed me to catch the movie was Nicollette Sheridan's presence, back then she was so fantastically sexy, her very tiny moments in here satisfied me highly. I remember how her azure miniskirt hunted me originally from one of the movie's video trailers.. Yes, we went to the movies to see a flick that was available on VHS at the moment (but we couldn't find it ANYWHERE !). (Robin Shou) was so amusing as the guardian angel; his character was the smartest point in the script. Strangely it was, and still is, one of the rarest times to love Chris Rock's performance in anything, we got the biggest laugh when he did the TV interview at the end. However the stunt move at the very last scene was maybe the cleverest bit. Thank god that Dana Carvey didn't play the lead role as it was intentioned, he could've transformed it into Beverly Hills unbearable Ninja! I enjoyed it so much. It was without a doubt the best movie I've watched out of these showings especially at that year (surely better than ones like Flubber, Mousehunt, etc). And the 3 of us had the prettiest time. We even took some photos for us while the intermission. Years later, I watched it on TV. Of course not the same feelings. I felt this time how it's gaspingly easy sketch after another, crowded with physical comedy only. But even if, it was well-made, it prompted me to recall some of the silent cinema's liveliest comedies. And after (Tommy Boy) I won't say it's a step down for (Farley) inasmuch as another type of comedy for him, which's simpler, attracts the kids, and succeeds at making them happy. Otherwise why all the children at the cinema clapped crazily in cheering while he was avoiding the evil man's bullets by his 2 swards ?! Great moment of cinema by the way. It's one of the finest and shortest 80 minutes movies ever. So enjoy its goofiness, it's good at it.

    A slapstick comedy starring Chris Farley, Beverly Hills Ninja is part prop-gag movie and part testament to the late comedian's physical comedic abilities. As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the "Great White Ninja." As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the Jojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene from Stripes. Beverly Hills Ninja may be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless.

    I have to say I feel the user rating for this film is pretty unfair. It does depend what you're after  if it's great art or a new perspective on the world then this is not the film for you. But on another day or night, when you just want to have some harmless senseless fun, it could be. It's not normally my standard type fare, but I found myself smirking away, and occasionally full on laughing at Farley's antics. There's nothing particular I can add regarding the "plot" that I think will be particularly helpful. But watching it left me feeling rather melancholy about the fact he's gone - he would have made a lot more people happy if he'd been around to continue. All that said, I bumped into it on cable, and watched it off TV. I might have been a bit less pleased with it if I'd paid rental fees.

    Beverly Hills Ninja is one of those movies you'll either love, or hate, depending on how one sees this film. The humour can be very childish and silly; on the other hand one might enjoy watching this brand of silliness and absurdity. It won't win brownie points for being original, but still Chris Farley is absolutely hilarious as the bumbling, 'white' ninja that his antics had me in laughing in stitches. I am not going to say watch this movie, or buy it- Beverly Hills Ninja might have you in hysterics- or it may annoy and irritate you. It rather depends on how you view this film. Farley plays an orphan, initially adopted by a group of ninjas as a baby- however when he grows up he becomes aloof, overweight, sluggish and what you called say, a buffoon. Anyway, an attractive woman mistakes Farley as a real ninja- which he is anything but a ninja- and he is hired to help the blonde. Haru witnesses a murder and ends up in the US, Beverly Hills-hence the title of the film. The stupidity of this film stems from Farley's outrageous, and some would say laughable attempts at defeating the bad guys, despite his lack of karate skills at his disposal. If you are expecting a film big on narrative and great acting, don't bother; if you are expecting that this movie will really make you think, don't bother. If, however, you are up for a laugh and you want to watch a film as farcical, as stupid and as insanely funny, without taking this movie seriously, then Beverly Hills Ninja is definitely worth a viewing or two. Otherwise, watch something else. I however thought this was daft- very daft but also entertaining, highly amusing and a good laugh.

    Chris Farley really broke out as a leading actor in 1995 when he did Tommy Boy. After that he went on to do Black Sheep and some small movies. Beverly Hills Ninja has an original story to it. This was definitely something that nobody else would think to type out into a screenplay. At points it was pretty amusing and funny, but sometimes you just had to think that it was complete stupidity. Farley was a great comedy movie actor and this proves his working chops, but it needed a little more jazz and spice to it so it could make a 10/10. So far I have decided to give 7/10. It gave a ton of effort and had a launching pad for Chris Rock. All and all it was decent.

It won't win brownie points for being original, but still Chris Farley is absolutely hilarious as the bumbling, 'white' ninja that his antics had me in laughing in stitches. I am not going to say watch this movie, or buy it- Beverly Hills Ninja might have you in hysterics- or it may annoy and irritate you. It rather depends on how you view this film. Farley plays an orphan, initially adopted by a group of ninjas as a baby- however when he grows up he becomes aloof, overweight, sluggish and what you called say, a buffoon. Anyway, an attractive woman mistakes Farley as a real ninja- which he is anything but a ninja- and he is hired to help the blonde. Haru witnesses a murder and ends up in the US, Beverly Hills-hence the title of the film. The stupidity of this film stems from Farley's outrageous, and some would say laughable attempts at defeating the bad guys, despite his lack of karate skills at his disposal. If you are expecting a film big on narrative and great acting, don't bother; if you are expecting that this movie will really make you think, don't bother. If, however, you are up for a laugh and you want to watch a film as farcical, as stupid and as insanely funny, without taking this movie seriously, then Beverly Hills Ninja is definitely worth a viewing or two. Otherwise, watch something else. I however thought this was daft- very daft but also entertaining, highly amusing and a good laugh.

    Chris Farley really broke out as a leading actor in 1995 when he did Tommy Boy. After that he went on to do Black Sheep and some small movies. Beverly Hills Ninja has an original story to it. This was definitely something that nobody else would think to type out into a screenplay. At points it was pretty amusing and funny, but sometimes you just had to think that it was complete stupidity. Farley was a great comedy movie actor and this proves his working chops, but it needed a little more jazz and spice to it so it could make a 10/10. So far I have decided to give 7/10. It gave a ton of effort and had a launching pad for Chris Rock. All and all it was decent.

    I actually like all of the films that Chris Farley made. It was tragic that he passed away, he's one of the funniest people I've seen. I heard he actually hated this movie upon release, but I love this one and I laugh every time I watch it. Farley was a great comedian and always funny. I like everything about this movie, even Chris Tucker is funny in this, but the real gold is Farley. This movie has some of my favorite physical stunts. I guess Farley was depressed and thought that he wasn't funny, that we was just the big dumb fat guy who always fell down. I've seen a lot of his films, and he's not that kind of person, he's the smart guy who always had a temper, but he was always funny. He's one of the funniest people I've seen and he's actually a favorite actor of mine. This film has such funny dialogue and any any aspiring actor should take care of how Farley performed his facial features and reactions, which are always priceless. It's just a shame that he's no longer with us, RIP Chris Farley.

    If you like Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and The Time of Their Lives, then you should like this movie. It's sad what happened to Farley, because he inherited that brand of comedy. Probably no one will be able to do comedy just like Lou Costello, but it would have been fun to see Chris Farley remake a couple of those movies. It's also sad he didn't like the movie - it entertained a lot of people. He could act as well, and I can understand wanting to branch out, but I hope he and everyone else had fun making this movie. I would hope Robin Shou had a blast. He inherited the Abbott role, and he did great. Everyone else did a fine job with what they had.

    The Late Chris Farley, is the main reason why you should watch 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. Farley's films have always been comedies. Right from the cult-classic 'Tommy boy, to 'Black sheep', 'Almost Heroes' and 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. And in all those films, he has excelled. 'Beverly Hills Ninja' tells the story of Haru, played by Farley, who was found by a clan of ninjas as an infant in an abandoned treasure chest and was raised by them. He never quite conforms to their culture and never acquires the skills of a ninja, but is nonetheless good-natured and persevering in his personal ambitions. His first mission brings him to Beverly Hills to investigate a recent murder. Now, if your a person who only enjoys 'Intelligent' & 'Real' Cinema, I'd say, Do Not watch this comedy. It's not meant for you. But for those, who admire comedy to the fullest, should not miss this. Sure, some jokes are kiddish, but some jokes, especially towards the finale, manage to bring in laughs. Dennis Dugan has the directed the film fairly. Acting wise: It's Farley who really owns the film. He excels and comes across as cute and soft. If Farley lived more, I am sure, he would have gone a legend. Miss you Farley!

    This movie took classic jokes but put them into suck odd places it makes them feel new. So the general plot is that Haru is a baby found on the shore of japan. An old legend of a foreign boy. now for the first time (or at least from the movies I've seen) They had a incorrect "Legend". This movie took classic jokes to new levels. This movie was great and I think that it was a great movie for a quick laugh! now onto the cons. -as it did have some jokes that felt new, others were just the same old ones from about every other movie that used them. Finally is that sometimes everything had the worst luck, I know this is a common element in comedy's but it's really getting old. But overall this is a great movie!

    Beverly Hills Ninja is a great comedy movie. Even if the plot could be retarded for some viewers, but for me it is very good because Beverly Hills Ninja was mainly on comedy. Chris Farley made a great on his role. Haru who should have been the greatest white ninja like the passage in the ninja scripture, but he wasn't. He grew as the dumb and dopey ninja which made his master and his (highly respected) brother in trouble. Farley acted himself like a false guy from god which I am very pleased on him. I was very surprised that he hated his movie when he saw at first time, maybe he didn't like how he act in the movie. But for me, his acting was very perfect and he should be respected as the great comedian. The plot maybe looked easy for someone but I don't think so. Beverly Hills Ninja has a very good and reasonable plot. The production also great too, the movie's crew showed everyone that its comedy movie could had the great graphic, special effects and cinematography. For the summary, Beverly Hills Ninja should be one of the greatest comedy movie. Everything was great and everyone should buy or rent this movie if you want to find some kind of fun!

    The date : Friday, September 18, 1998. The place : Cairo. The happening : I made an appointment with 2 of my friends at 9: 45 AM near one of the biggest theaters downtown. This very cinema used to show every Friday's morning a movie for kids. Although me so my friends were in our early 20s but we managed to go in anyway. Because I'm the one who came up with this peerless suggestion, one of my friends told me he's worried about watching a movie among all-children-audience, but for experienced viewer like me who has been there more than once at many Fridays before, I made it clear that it's a real treat, and how the most annoying child is more quiet than any vexatious stupid who loves to crack jokes while the watching. The sight inside the cinema was fabulous; the kids were playing with their parents, the only echoes you hear were for laughs, till the lights went off, and the movie began, then the tranquility ruled. From the first minute he appeared (Chris Farley) captured the kids' hearts, so ours too. The movie's atmosphere, image, and fast pace made it a lovely cartoon. There was a funny moment every moment. The hot reactions of the kids and their thunderous laughs moved me in a way I can't forget. The strip club brief scene made one of my friends eye-popping, jaw-dropping and losing his capacity of talking, yet in a good way. But as for me, one of the top reasons that pushed me to catch the movie was Nicollette Sheridan's presence, back then she was so fantastically sexy, her very tiny moments in here satisfied me highly. I remember how her azure miniskirt hunted me originally from one of the movie's video trailers.. Yes, we went to the movies to see a flick that was available on VHS at the moment (but we couldn't find it ANYWHERE !). (Robin Shou) was so amusing as the guardian angel; his character was the smartest point in the script. Strangely it was, and still is, one of the rarest times to love Chris Rock's performance in anything, we got the biggest laugh when he did the TV interview at the end. However the stunt move at the very last scene was maybe the cleverest bit. Thank god that Dana Carvey didn't play the lead role as it was intentioned, he could've transformed it into Beverly Hills unbearable Ninja! I enjoyed it so much. It was without a doubt the best movie I've watched out of these showings especially at that year (surely better than ones like Flubber, Mousehunt, etc). And the 3 of us had the prettiest time. We even took some photos for us while the intermission. Years later, I watched it on TV. Of course not the same feelings. I felt this time how it's gaspingly easy sketch after another, crowded with physical comedy only. But even if, it was well-made, it prompted me to recall some of the silent cinema's liveliest comedies. And after (Tommy Boy) I won't say it's a step down for (Farley) inasmuch as another type of comedy for him, which's simpler, attracts the kids, and succeeds at making them happy. Otherwise why all the children at the cinema clapped crazily in cheering while he was avoiding the evil man's bullets by his 2 swards ?! Great moment of cinema by the way. It's one of the finest and shortest 80 minutes movies ever. So enjoy its goofiness, it's good at it.

    A slapstick comedy starring Chris Farley, Beverly Hills Ninja is part prop-gag movie and part testament to the late comedian's physical comedic abilities. As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the "Great White Ninja." As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the Jojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene from Stripes. Beverly Hills Ninja may be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless.

    I have to say I feel the user rating for this film is pretty unfair. It does depend what you're after  if it's great art or a new perspective on the world then this is not the film for you. But on another day or night, when you just want to have some harmless senseless fun, it could be. It's not normally my standard type fare, but I found myself smirking away, and occasionally full on laughing at Farley's antics. There's nothing particular I can add regarding the "plot" that I think will be particularly helpful. But watching it left me feeling rather melancholy about the fact he's gone - he would have made a lot more people happy if he'd been around to continue. All that said, I bumped into it on cable, and watched it off TV. I might have been a bit less pleased with it if I'd paid rental fees.

    Beverly Hills Ninja is one of those movies you'll either love, or hate, depending on how one sees this film. The humour can be very childish and silly; on the other hand one might enjoy watching this brand of silliness and absurdity. It won't win brownie points for being original, but still Chris Farley is absolutely hilarious as the bumbling, 'white' ninja that his antics had me in laughing in stitches. I am not going to say watch this movie, or buy it- Beverly Hills Ninja might have you in hysterics- or it may annoy and irritate you. It rather depends on how you view this film. Farley plays an orphan, initially adopted by a group of ninjas as a baby- however when he grows up he becomes aloof, overweight, sluggish and what you called say, a buffoon. Anyway, an attractive woman mistakes Farley as a real ninja- which he is anything but a ninja- and he is hired to help the blonde. Haru witnesses a murder and ends up in the US, Beverly Hills-hence the title of the film. The stupidity of this film stems from Farley's outrageous, and some would say laughable attempts at defeating the bad guys, despite his lack of karate skills at his disposal. If you are expecting a film big on narrative and great acting, don't bother; if you are expecting that this movie will really make you think, don't bother. If, however, you are up for a laugh and you want to watch a film as farcical, as stupid and as insanely funny, without taking this movie seriously, then Beverly Hills Ninja is definitely worth a viewing or two. Otherwise, watch something else. I however thought this was daft- very daft but also entertaining, highly amusing and a good laugh.

    Chris Farley really broke out as a leading actor in 1995 when he did Tommy Boy. After that he went on to do Black Sheep and some small movies. Beverly Hills Ninja has an original story to it. This was definitely something that nobody else would think to type out into a screenplay. At points it was pretty amusing and funny, but sometimes you just had to think that it was complete stupidity. Farley was a great comedy movie actor and this proves his working chops, but it needed a little more jazz and spice to it so it could make a 10/10. So far I have decided to give 7/10. It gave a ton of effort and had a launching pad for Chris Rock. All and all it was decent.

    I actually like all of the films that Chris Farley made. It was tragic that he passed away, he's one of the funniest people I've seen. I heard he actually hated this movie upon release, but I love this one and I laugh every time I watch it. Farley was a great comedian and always funny. I like everything about this movie, even Chris Tucker is funny in this, but the real gold is Farley. This movie has some of my favorite physical stunts. I guess Farley was depressed and thought that he wasn't funny, that we was just the big dumb fat guy who always fell down. I've seen a lot of his films, and he's not that kind of person, he's the smart guy who always had a temper, but he was always funny. He's one of the funniest people I've seen and he's actually a favorite actor of mine. This film has such funny dialogue and any any aspiring actor should take care of how Farley performed his facial features and reactions, which are always priceless. It's just a shame that he's no longer with us, RIP Chris Farley.

    If you like Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and The Time of Their Lives, then you should like this movie. It's sad what happened to Farley, because he inherited that brand of comedy. Probably no one will be able to do comedy just like Lou Costello, but it would have been fun to see Chris Farley remake a couple of those movies. It's also sad he didn't like the movie - it entertained a lot of people. He could act as well, and I can understand wanting to branch out, but I hope he and everyone else had fun making this movie. I would hope Robin Shou had a blast. He inherited the Abbott role, and he did great. Everyone else did a fine job with what they had.

    The Late Chris Farley, is the main reason why you should watch 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. Farley's films have always been comedies. Right from the cult-classic 'Tommy boy, to 'Black sheep', 'Almost Heroes' and 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. And in all those films, he has excelled. 'Beverly Hills Ninja' tells the story of Haru, played by Farley, who was found by a clan of ninjas as an infant in an abandoned treasure chest and was raised by them. He never quite conforms to their culture and never acquires the skills of a ninja, but is nonetheless good-natured and persevering in his personal ambitions. His first mission brings him to Beverly Hills to investigate a recent murder. Now, if your a person who only enjoys 'Intelligent' & 'Real' Cinema, I'd say, Do Not watch this comedy. It's not meant for you. But for those, who admire comedy to the fullest, should not miss this. Sure, some jokes are kiddish, but some jokes, especially towards the finale, manage to bring in laughs. Dennis Dugan has the directed the film fairly. Acting wise: It's Farley who really owns the film. He excels and comes across as cute and soft. If Farley lived more, I am sure, he would have gone a legend. Miss you Farley!

    This movie took classic jokes but put them into suck odd places it makes them feel new. So the general plot is that Haru is a baby found on the shore of japan. An old legend of a foreign boy. now for the first time (or at least from the movies I've seen) They had a incorrect "Legend". This movie took classic jokes to new levels. This movie was great and I think that it was a great movie for a quick laugh! now onto the cons. -as it did have some jokes that felt new, others were just the same old ones from about every other movie that used them. Finally is that sometimes everything had the worst luck, I know this is a common element in comedy's but it's really getting old. But overall this is a great movie!

    Beverly Hills Ninja is a great comedy movie. Even if the plot could be retarded for some viewers, but for me it is very good because Beverly Hills Ninja was mainly on comedy. Chris Farley made a great on his role. Haru who should have been the greatest white ninja like the passage in the ninja scripture, but he wasn't. He grew as the dumb and dopey ninja which made his master and his (highly respected) brother in trouble. Farley acted himself like a false guy from god which I am very pleased on him. I was very surprised that he hated his movie when he saw at first time, maybe he didn't like how he act in the movie. But for me, his acting was very perfect and he should be respected as the great comedian. The plot maybe looked easy for someone but I don't think so. Beverly Hills Ninja has a very good and reasonable plot. The production also great too, the movie's crew showed everyone that its comedy movie could had the great graphic, special effects and cinematography. For the summary, Beverly Hills Ninja should be one of the greatest comedy movie. Everything was great and everyone should buy or rent this movie if you want to find some kind of fun!

    The date : Friday, September 18, 1998. The place : Cairo. The happening : I made an appointment with 2 of my friends at 9: 45 AM near one of the biggest theaters downtown. This very cinema used to show every Friday's morning a movie for kids. Although me so my friends were in our early 20s but we managed to go in anyway. Because I'm the one who came up with this peerless suggestion, one of my friends told me he's worried about watching a movie among all-children-audience, but for experienced viewer like me who has been there more than once at many Fridays before, I made it clear that it's a real treat, and how the most annoying child is more quiet than any vexatious stupid who loves to crack jokes while the watching. The sight inside the cinema was fabulous; the kids were playing with their parents, the only echoes you hear were for laughs, till the lights went off, and the movie began, then the tranquility ruled. From the first minute he appeared (Chris Farley) captured the kids' hearts, so ours too. The movie's atmosphere, image, and fast pace made it a lovely cartoon. There was a funny moment every moment. The hot reactions of the kids and their thunderous laughs moved me in a way I can't forget. The strip club brief scene made one of my friends eye-popping, jaw-dropping and losing his capacity of talking, yet in a good way. But as for me, one of the top reasons that pushed me to catch the movie was Nicollette Sheridan's presence, back then she was so fantastically sexy, her very tiny moments in here satisfied me highly. I remember how her azure miniskirt hunted me originally from one of the movie's video trailers.. Yes, we went to the movies to see a flick that was available on VHS at the moment (but we couldn't find it ANYWHERE !). (Robin Shou) was so amusing as the guardian angel; his character was the smartest point in the script. Strangely it was, and still is, one of the rarest times to love Chris Rock's performance in anything, we got the biggest laugh when he did the TV interview at the end. However the stunt move at the very last scene was maybe the cleverest bit. Thank god that Dana Carvey didn't play the lead role as it was intentioned, he could've transformed it into Beverly Hills unbearable Ninja! I enjoyed it so much. It was without a doubt the best movie I've watched out of these showings especially at that year (surely better than ones like Flubber, Mousehunt, etc). And the 3 of us had the prettiest time. We even took some photos for us while the intermission. Years later, I watched it on TV. Of course not the same feelings. I felt this time how it's gaspingly easy sketch after another, crowded with physical comedy only. But even if, it was well-made, it prompted me to recall some of the silent cinema's liveliest comedies. And after (Tommy Boy) I won't say it's a step down for (Farley) inasmuch as another type of comedy for him, which's simpler, attracts the kids, and succeeds at making them happy. Otherwise why all the children at the cinema clapped crazily in cheering while he was avoiding the evil man's bullets by his 2 swards ?! Great moment of cinema by the way. It's one of the finest and shortest 80 minutes movies ever. So enjoy its goofiness, it's good at it.

    A slapstick comedy starring Chris Farley, Beverly Hills Ninja is part prop-gag movie and part testament to the late comedian's physical comedic abilities. As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the "Great White Ninja." As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the Jojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene from Stripes. Beverly Hills Ninja may be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless.

    I have to say I feel the user rating for this film is pretty unfair. It does depend what you're after  if it's great art or a new perspective on the world then this is not the film for you. But on another day or night, when you just want to have some harmless senseless fun, it could be. It's not normally my standard type fare, but I found myself smirking away, and occasionally full on laughing at Farley's antics. There's nothing particular I can add regarding the "plot" that I think will be particularly helpful. But watching it left me feeling rather melancholy about the fact he's gone - he would have made a lot more people happy if he'd been around to continue. All that said, I bumped into it on cable, and watched it off TV. I might have been a bit less pleased with it if I'd paid rental fees.

    Beverly Hills Ninja is one of those movies you'll either love, or hate, depending on how one sees this film. The humour can be very childish and silly; on the other hand one might enjoy watching this brand of silliness and absurdity. It won't win brownie points for being original, but still Chris Farley is absolutely hilarious as the bumbling, 'white' ninja that his antics had me in laughing in stitches. I am not going to say watch this movie, or buy it- Beverly Hills Ninja might have you in hysterics- or it may annoy and irritate you. It rather depends on how you view this film. Farley plays an orphan, initially adopted by a group of ninjas as a baby- however when he grows up he becomes aloof, overweight, sluggish and what you called say, a buffoon. Anyway, an attractive woman mistakes Farley as a real ninja- which he is anything but a ninja- and he is hired to help the blonde. Haru witnesses a murder and ends up in the US, Beverly Hills-hence the title of the film. The stupidity of this film stems from Farley's outrageous, and some would say laughable attempts at defeating the bad guys, despite his lack of karate skills at his disposal. If you are expecting a film big on narrative and great acting, don't bother; if you are expecting that this movie will really make you think, don't bother. If, however, you are up for a laugh and you want to watch a film as farcical, as stupid and as insanely funny, without taking this movie seriously, then Beverly Hills Ninja is definitely worth a viewing or two. Otherwise, watch something else. I however thought this was daft- very daft but also entertaining, highly amusing and a good laugh.

    Chris Farley really broke out as a leading actor in 1995 when he did Tommy Boy. After that he went on to do Black Sheep and some small movies. Beverly Hills Ninja has an original story to it. This was definitely something that nobody else would think to type out into a screenplay. At points it was pretty amusing and funny, but sometimes you just had to think that it was complete stupidity. Farley was a great comedy movie actor and this proves his working chops, but it needed a little more jazz and spice to it so it could make a 10/10. So far I have decided to give 7/10. It gave a ton of effort and had a launching pad for Chris Rock. All and all it was decent.
