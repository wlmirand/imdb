 <sinopse>
  An 8-year-old boy, who is accidentally left behind while his family flies to France for Christmas, has to defend his home against idiotic burglars.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It is Christmas time and the McAllister family is preparing for a vacation in Paris, France. But the youngest in the family named Kevin got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz and was sent to his room which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers about two burglars, Harry and Marv, about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.

    Home Alone is a decent family comedy that will work as a decent Christmas film or just a well done family film. It has good morals, good jokes, slapstick violence and pre-insane Macaulay Culkin as our lone hero. Like I said, this film is overall harmless good fun that lacks any surprises or anything that would make films like Kiki's Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart a memorable kids's films. Acting is solid, jokes work for the most part and it never overstays it welcome, which is never a bad thing. I watched it plenty as a kid and do think that it holds up pretty well. It's a good family film for a evening when you are in dire need of simple laughs and bizarre slapstick violence.

    Home Alone, what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome Macaulay Culkin who starred as Kevin McCallister. This film was great family comedy full of laughs, full of fun, and Christmas adventure. This film touched our hearts and all. Home Alone was a great success and one of the best family Christmas comedy films of all-time. If you love Macaulay Culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see. Can't agree more Macaulay Culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in Home Alone. He brought on a electrifying character and performance. Terrific family film for all families to enjoy. Great direction by Chris Columbus. Great writing by John Hughes. Home Alone. A must watch film that you can't miss out on! "This is my house, I have to defend it." - Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone)

    John Hughes has made a lot of great movies during his time of directing; this, and The 101 Dalmatians Remake are a few to name. John Hughes never directed a film that I dislike, although; I had mixed feelings for "Dennis", and "Home Alone 3". Home Alone is the classic story about the eight year old oddball: Kevin, who is accidentally left at home around the Christmas holidays, and with his parents not around; two burglars: Marv, and Harry, plan to rob his family's house, but Kevin has got surprises for them! The way that an eight year old can out-smarten two dumb crooks in a house on his own is absolutely hilarious! The slapstick jokes was what gave John Hughes a benchmark in his own career. This film is not to be missed. 10/10! Written By Alienator Donut.

    - B+ Another very good Christmas film with a good kid, great crooks, and an excellent climax that is one of my favorite climaxes ever in a movie. The film is a kids wish to be alone and it comes true. We then get to see his life alone, his family worries about him, and the thieves trying to get in but don't realize that its just a kid inside. There are some very funny scenes and then there is one of the best scenes of Kevin and the old man meeting at the church leading to the amazing climax of the kid protecting his house as the thieves try to break in. There is tons of humor and very entertaining to watch. The film is a Christmas classic.

    Kevin McCallister is one of the most unforgettable, if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through Hollywood. When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season. HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir. The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN. Media states that "Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did. "Tis the season to be jolly" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday. If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. Happy Viewing dear readers. Merry Christmas! TITLE: HOME ALONE DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN AND CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 103 MINUTES

    When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots.

    HOME ALONE This is another classic Christmas film. I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...). The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be. This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin. The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy. Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score. I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once. I will give this film 8 out of 10. Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.

    An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief. The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv. All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once. 8/10

    Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it). Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.

    Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes. Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous. If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic. I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.

    Home Alone is a decent family comedy that will work as a decent Christmas film or just a well done family film. It has good morals, good jokes, slapstick violence and pre-insane Macaulay Culkin as our lone hero. Like I said, this film is overall harmless good fun that lacks any surprises or anything that would make films like Kiki's Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart a memorable kids's films. Acting is solid, jokes work for the most part and it never overstays it welcome, which is never a bad thing. I watched it plenty as a kid and do think that it holds up pretty well. It's a good family film for a evening when you are in dire need of simple laughs and bizarre slapstick violence.

    Home Alone, what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome Macaulay Culkin who starred as Kevin McCallister. This film was great family comedy full of laughs, full of fun, and Christmas adventure. This film touched our hearts and all. Home Alone was a great success and one of the best family Christmas comedy films of all-time. If you love Macaulay Culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see. Can't agree more Macaulay Culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in Home Alone. He brought on a electrifying character and performance. Terrific family film for all families to enjoy. Great direction by Chris Columbus. Great writing by John Hughes. Home Alone. A must watch film that you can't miss out on! "This is my house, I have to defend it." - Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone)

    John Hughes has made a lot of great movies during his time of directing; this, and The 101 Dalmatians Remake are a few to name. John Hughes never directed a film that I dislike, although; I had mixed feelings for "Dennis", and "Home Alone 3". Home Alone is the classic story about the eight year old oddball: Kevin, who is accidentally left at home around the Christmas holidays, and with his parents not around; two burglars: Marv, and Harry, plan to rob his family's house, but Kevin has got surprises for them! The way that an eight year old can out-smarten two dumb crooks in a house on his own is absolutely hilarious! The slapstick jokes was what gave John Hughes a benchmark in his own career. This film is not to be missed. 10/10! Written By Alienator Donut.

    - B+ Another very good Christmas film with a good kid, great crooks, and an excellent climax that is one of my favorite climaxes ever in a movie. The film is a kids wish to be alone and it comes true. We then get to see his life alone, his family worries about him, and the thieves trying to get in but don't realize that its just a kid inside. There are some very funny scenes and then there is one of the best scenes of Kevin and the old man meeting at the church leading to the amazing climax of the kid protecting his house as the thieves try to break in. There is tons of humor and very entertaining to watch. The film is a Christmas classic.

    Kevin McCallister is one of the most unforgettable, if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through Hollywood. When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season. HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir. The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN. Media states that "Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did. "Tis the season to be jolly" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday. If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. Happy Viewing dear readers. Merry Christmas! TITLE: HOME ALONE DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN AND CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 103 MINUTES

    When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots.

    HOME ALONE This is another classic Christmas film. I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...). The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be. This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin. The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy. Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score. I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once. I will give this film 8 out of 10. Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.

    An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief. The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv. All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once. 8/10

    Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it). Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.

    Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes. Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous. If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic. I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.

Home Alone is the classic story about the eight year old oddball: Kevin, who is accidentally left at home around the Christmas holidays, and with his parents not around; two burglars: Marv, and Harry, plan to rob his family's house, but Kevin has got surprises for them! The way that an eight year old can out-smarten two dumb crooks in a house on his own is absolutely hilarious! The slapstick jokes was what gave John Hughes a benchmark in his own career. This film is not to be missed. 10/10! Written By Alienator Donut.

    - B+ Another very good Christmas film with a good kid, great crooks, and an excellent climax that is one of my favorite climaxes ever in a movie. The film is a kids wish to be alone and it comes true. We then get to see his life alone, his family worries about him, and the thieves trying to get in but don't realize that its just a kid inside. There are some very funny scenes and then there is one of the best scenes of Kevin and the old man meeting at the church leading to the amazing climax of the kid protecting his house as the thieves try to break in. There is tons of humor and very entertaining to watch. The film is a Christmas classic.

    Kevin McCallister is one of the most unforgettable, if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through Hollywood. When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season. HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir. The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN. Media states that "Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did. "Tis the season to be jolly" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday. If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. Happy Viewing dear readers. Merry Christmas! TITLE: HOME ALONE DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN AND CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 103 MINUTES

    When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots.

    HOME ALONE This is another classic Christmas film. I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...). The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be. This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin. The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy. Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score. I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once. I will give this film 8 out of 10. Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.

    An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief. The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv. All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once. 8/10

    Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it). Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.

    Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes. Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous. If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic. I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.

    Home Alone is a decent family comedy that will work as a decent Christmas film or just a well done family film. It has good morals, good jokes, slapstick violence and pre-insane Macaulay Culkin as our lone hero. Like I said, this film is overall harmless good fun that lacks any surprises or anything that would make films like Kiki's Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart a memorable kids's films. Acting is solid, jokes work for the most part and it never overstays it welcome, which is never a bad thing. I watched it plenty as a kid and do think that it holds up pretty well. It's a good family film for a evening when you are in dire need of simple laughs and bizarre slapstick violence.

    Home Alone, what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome Macaulay Culkin who starred as Kevin McCallister. This film was great family comedy full of laughs, full of fun, and Christmas adventure. This film touched our hearts and all. Home Alone was a great success and one of the best family Christmas comedy films of all-time. If you love Macaulay Culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see. Can't agree more Macaulay Culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in Home Alone. He brought on a electrifying character and performance. Terrific family film for all families to enjoy. Great direction by Chris Columbus. Great writing by John Hughes. Home Alone. A must watch film that you can't miss out on!

Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir. The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN. Media states that "Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did. "Tis the season to be jolly" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday. If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. Happy Viewing dear readers. Merry Christmas! TITLE: HOME ALONE DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN AND CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 103 MINUTES

    When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots.

    HOME ALONE This is another classic Christmas film. I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...). The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be. This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin. The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy. Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score. I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once. I will give this film 8 out of 10. Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.

    An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief. The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv. All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once. 8/10

    Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it). Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.

    Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes. Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous. If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic. I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.

    Home Alone is a decent family comedy that will work as a decent Christmas film or just a well done family film. It has good morals, good jokes, slapstick violence and pre-insane Macaulay Culkin as our lone hero. Like I said, this film is overall harmless good fun that lacks any surprises or anything that would make films like Kiki's Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart a memorable kids's films. Acting is solid, jokes work for the most part and it never overstays it welcome, which is never a bad thing. I watched it plenty as a kid and do think that it holds up pretty well. It's a good family film for a evening when you are in dire need of simple laughs and bizarre slapstick violence.

    Home Alone, what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome Macaulay Culkin who starred as Kevin McCallister. This film was great family comedy full of laughs, full of fun, and Christmas adventure. This film touched our hearts and all. Home Alone was a great success and one of the best family Christmas comedy films of all-time. If you love Macaulay Culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see. Can't agree more Macaulay Culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in Home Alone. He brought on a electrifying character and performance. Terrific family film for all families to enjoy. Great direction by Chris Columbus. Great writing by John Hughes. Home Alone. A must watch film that you can't miss out on!

    John Hughes has made a lot of great movies during his time of directing; this, and The 101 Dalmatians Remake are a few to name. John Hughes never directed a film that I dislike, although; I had mixed feelings for "Dennis", and "Home Alone 3". Home Alone is the classic story about the eight year old oddball: Kevin, who is accidentally left at home around the Christmas holidays, and with his parents not around; two burglars: Marv, and Harry, plan to rob his family's house, but Kevin has got surprises for them! The way that an eight year old can out-smarten two dumb crooks in a house on his own is absolutely hilarious! The slapstick jokes was what gave John Hughes a benchmark in his own career. This film is not to be missed. 10/10! Written By Alienator Donut.

    - B+ Another very good Christmas film with a good kid, great crooks, and an excellent climax that is one of my favorite climaxes ever in a movie. The film is a kids wish to be alone and it comes true. We then get to see his life alone, his family worries about him, and the thieves trying to get in but don't realize that its just a kid inside. There are some very funny scenes and then there is one of the best scenes of Kevin and the old man meeting at the church leading to the amazing climax of the kid protecting his house as the thieves try to break in. There is tons of humor and very entertaining to watch. The film is a Christmas classic.

    When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots.

    HOME ALONE This is another classic Christmas film. I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...). The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be. This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin. The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy. Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score. I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once. I will give this film 8 out of 10. Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.

    An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief. The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv. All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once. 8/10

    Home Alone is a great movie with a good story,characters,cast,some funny scenes and a fun Christmas theme that make it a great movie to watch with the whole family,especially during the holidays.The movie is very well remembered,and is more than twenty years old but still holds up really well with todays standards,it started the career of child star Macaulay Culkin and is pretty much the only good thing he has ever been in (the Home Alone isn't that bad,everything else he was in,forget about it). Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a family Christmas vacation to France and leave him behind.At first,he enjoys being on his own,but he finds out burglars are planning to rob his house,thinking there is no one there.

    Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes. Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous. If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic. I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.

    Home Alone is a decent family comedy that will work as a decent Christmas film or just a well done family film. It has good morals, good jokes, slapstick violence and pre-insane Macaulay Culkin as our lone hero. Like I said, this film is overall harmless good fun that lacks any surprises or anything that would make films like Kiki's Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart a memorable kids's films. Acting is solid, jokes work for the most part and it never overstays it welcome, which is never a bad thing. I watched it plenty as a kid and do think that it holds up pretty well. It's a good family film for a evening when you are in dire need of simple laughs and bizarre slapstick violence.

    Home Alone, what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome Macaulay Culkin who starred as Kevin McCallister. This film was great family comedy full of laughs, full of fun, and Christmas adventure. This film touched our hearts and all. Home Alone was a great success and one of the best family Christmas comedy films of all-time. If you love Macaulay Culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see. Can't agree more Macaulay Culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in Home Alone. He brought on a electrifying character and performance. Terrific family film for all families to enjoy. Great direction by Chris Columbus. Great writing by John Hughes. Home Alone. A must watch film that you can't miss out on! "This is my house, I have to defend it." - Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone)

    John Hughes has made a lot of great movies during his time of directing; this, and The 101 Dalmatians Remake are a few to name. John Hughes never directed a film that I dislike, although; I had mixed feelings for "Dennis", and "Home Alone 3". Home Alone is the classic story about the eight year old oddball: Kevin, who is accidentally left at home around the Christmas holidays, and with his parents not around; two burglars: Marv, and Harry, plan to rob his family's house, but Kevin has got surprises for them! The way that an eight year old can out-smarten two dumb crooks in a house on his own is absolutely hilarious! The slapstick jokes was what gave John Hughes a benchmark in his own career. This film is not to be missed. 10/10! Written By Alienator Donut.

    - B+ Another very good Christmas film with a good kid, great crooks, and an excellent climax that is one of my favorite climaxes ever in a movie. The film is a kids wish to be alone and it comes true. We then get to see his life alone, his family worries about him, and the thieves trying to get in but don't realize that its just a kid inside. There are some very funny scenes and then there is one of the best scenes of Kevin and the old man meeting at the church leading to the amazing climax of the kid protecting his house as the thieves try to break in. There is tons of humor and very entertaining to watch. The film is a Christmas classic.

    Kevin McCallister is one of the most unforgettable, if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through Hollywood. When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season. HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir. The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN. Media states that "Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did. "Tis the season to be jolly" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday. If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. Happy Viewing dear readers. Merry Christmas!
