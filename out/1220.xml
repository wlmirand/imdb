 <sinopse>
  People from all different walks of life, encounter racial tension, rape, responsibility, and the meaning of an education on a university campus.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Youngsters from different countries, races, and social background are forced to integrate when they all enroll in Columbus University. They all have their own problems, such as finance, harrassment, personal safety, and self doubt. Additionally, campus life seems to be causing a problem for everyone: racism. Students, already under pressure to perform in the classroom, on the track, or in front of their friends, are strained to the breaking point by prejudice, inexperience, and misunderstanding.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting.

Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

    Having over fifteen years of space away from this film, watching it again makes me realize how utterly disconnected from reality this film is. The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money. But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless. If anything, it serves as a very good warning about moralizing in cinema: you better be damn sure you make something that, even if proved wrong, proves a point. If not, you're just making Sid Davis films with better stock.

    Hard to believe the extremes of the reviews of this film. It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich&eacute;s, but a good film nonetheless.

    To be fair, "Higher Learning" came out in the midst of one of the most liberal decades in the history of this country: the 1990's. Sadly, this does not excuse the blatant irresponsibility on display by writer/director John Singleton in his portrayal of both black and white college students. They remind me of characters from a film like "Not Another Teen Movie." Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, "Higher Learning" is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more. The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer. It is absurd and unrealistic. The Neo-Nazi's are pathetic, mouth-breathing morons and the Black Power guys are intelligent, transcendent disciples of Huey Newton who, somehow, are still oppressed in 1995. I wouldn't say this is the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it sure is close. Only to be viewed by those with an IQ of 130 or higher and even then, just for pure comedic value. The acting is pretty good by all those involved, but the script stinks, the story is over the top ridiculous and the overall message here is not good. Anyone else notice that music in the 90's was better than now, but movies have definitely gotten better!? 2 out of 10, kids.

    This is a review of "Rosewood" and "Higher Learning", two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, "Rosewood" takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal "Man With No Name" (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment. A single incident sets the town alight: a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. "He was so big!" she screams. "He was so black!" The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly. Though it pretends to be "serious" and "historical", "Rosewood" is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token "nuanced white". He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to "do the right thing". Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes: all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river. Like most films "about racism", "Rosewood" has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as "slave catchers", whilst "strikebreakers" - workers used to replace white strikers  always came from outside the area and/or "lower" ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, "Rosewood's" message is typical of all of Singleton's films: evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else. Singleton's "Higher Learning" tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, "Boyz n the Hood", actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact. While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word "unlearn" is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a "higher education" beyond "education" is the solution, that one should "unlearn" what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    I thought I would originally review John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood and Poetic Justice for Black History Month here on IMDb but I found out the YouTube uploads had some scenes blocked by Columbia Pictures. So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen: Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should "help a brother out". Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class: Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one: after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a "black bitch" which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

    This is such a powerful and underrated movie. One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites. The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's " just as bad" when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go "Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through". But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes. It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots. But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools. I literally can't understand how this movie has gotten such a low rating and that many bad reviews. I guess people are just insane and focus on all the wrong aspects when watching this movie.

    This was a good movie. I don't understand the reviews that it was skewed in its portrayals of whites as the villains and the blacks as the downtrodden victims who just won't take anymore. I personally think that it was very balanced in that area. There were stupid white people and stupid black people. What I would think is the most skewed is it's portrayal of the men as the villains and the women as the angelic do gooders. I think it ignored the fact that women can be just as awful, but tend not to be as outwardly violent, but I guess you can't have it all in one movie or else it would have been like 5 hours long. It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

    I was so excited when I saw Ice Cube's name, cuz I love the Friday franchise and his action flicks are entertaining, but wow! If its watched by someone who can ignore the heavily pushed message, then it might be OK, but then it wouldn't have any dialogue... What a catch 22. It showed racism & sexism from all sides, but more leaned toward the white MALE being the bad guy who has homosexual undertones. I didn't say MAN, because real MEN from any race aren't racist. You hear that Singleton and Spike Lee? I'm a white man whose ancestors were oppressed also. I'm Scottish with a little Irish blood too. Look it up. But there's always people who can't let go and move forward in every race too. Its just unfortunate that some work their way into showbiz and politics and try to spread their propaganda. Its everyone's world, so LIVE IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OR KILL YOURSELF!!! :) Spread love not lies.

    This movie is just a two hour reel of stereotypes, but that being said, stereotypes usually stem from some bit of truth. The way i viewed this movie is Blacks feel all whites are racist and trying to hold them down. And all Whites feel no black has earned his way, and need hand outs to get where they are. The movie does good on showing different struggles, and Ice Cubes and Cole Hauser, by far are the most intriguing characters. They are polar opposites, and both wrong. But, we all have met their characters in real life. My biggest gripe with this movie is the fight scene between the skinheads and African Americans. All the whites get beat up, even the big roided out arian, gets stomped by a fat out of shape black guy. Bob Sapp ain't takin out Brock lesnar, but Singleton is not a very truthful director.

    A film that pretends to be lots of things but succeeds in being nothing. This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich&eacute;s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth. The characters: * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right. * A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim. * Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character. * The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him. * Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates "slaves" who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.
