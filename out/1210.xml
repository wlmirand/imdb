 <sinopse>
  A virtual-reality serial killer manages to escape into the real world.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Centre (LETAC) has developed SID version 6.7: a Sadistic, Intelligent, and Dangerous virtual reality entity which is synthesized from the personalities of more than 150 serial killers. LETAC would like to train police officers by putting them in VR with SID, but they must prove the concept by using prisoners as test subjects. One such prisoner is ex-cop Parker Barnes. When SID manages to inject his personality into a nano-machine android, it appears that Barnes might be the only one who can stop him.

    Another dismal clunker from Brett Leonard, also the director of such cack as 'The Lawnmower Man' and 'Hideaway'. This is slightly better than those movies but it's still a tacky cine-bin which interminably stretches out a plot that would barely get an episode of the 'Outer Limits' revival to the first commercial break. Denzel Washington is an ex-cop trying to track down virtual reality villain Russell Crowe, who was created for a police simulation using the personalities of murderous psychos and has now escaped into the real world. See, it's just balls, isn't it? Not only was this tat horribly dated ten minutes after it opened, but Leonard's fascination with cut-price CG effects continues unabated and the whole thing looks cheap as hell. What a class act like Washington is doing in this I don't know; the material is the stuff of straight-to-video cobblers.

    I mean really... How many other films of this Cyberpunk type are as fun, engaging, have such a charismatic bad guy, have friggn' DENZEL WASHINGTON for God's sake, a sharp concept, and pretty darn good execution? 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC'...??? Uh huh, with Mr Cheeeeez@ss Ice Tea, right... This film is perfectly great! It's LOTS of fun, Denzel is excellent as usual, all the supporting actors do a fine job, and I was not aware originally that Russell Crowe was the bad guy in this, but he is delightfully Evil without being so campy (like MOST similar Evil villains - can you say 'Freddy' anyone...?) Very entertaining. I cannot for the life of me see why this director after doing both 'LAWNMOWER MAN' and this film, suddenly dropped off the map. Very sad... Never really made much after this too Look, if you are NOT a bloody film snob AND you like fun Sci Fi AND if you have 1/2 a brain with imagination where you can buy into a great story like this without Bitch'n and Moan'n, THEN YES you should really enjoy this film like I just did. NO, it is not 'BLADERUNNER'; NO, it is not 'THX-1138'. And it DEFINITELY is NOT 'CHILDREN OF MEN' But... I sure as hell will sit down and watch this again before watching 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS' or 'E.T.' or other cutesy, self conscious supposed 'Sci Fi' films. Geez, a few months ago I tried to watch the Blu-ray of 'CONTACT', which is this really HIGH rated, 'serious' Sci Fi film, and it was all I could do NOT to hang myself several times. B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G.... Nah, this one's great. It has fast pacing, it has some neat effects, it has a charismatic and genuinely disturbing bad guy, it has a TINY bit of humour, just to flavour it, NOT bloody overwhelm and CHEEEEEZ it to death. It is Oscar material? No... Is it fun? HELL yeah!

    This is quite a fascinating look at early computer technology and an artifact of its time that is quite a colorful entertainment. A violent, great looking, slick Movie with a despicable Villain worth rooting for. Russell Crowe has a field day with his spot on interpretation of artificial intelligence programmed to be what he is, a psycho killer with an unforgettable sense of humor. It is all beautifully and brutally laid out in an abundance of wild state of the art SFX (for 1995) that become more over the top as it goes along and it is better for it. The ending and ticking time bomb is just a little too long and slows the momentum a bit, but til then, strap on your seat belt, put on your VR glasses, and prepare to be taken for a ride.

    The reason to watch "Virtuosity" is Russell Crowe, who's in top shape here (women will agree for sure) and clearly having the time of his life. All the scenes where he appears are hilarious, and the way he delivers the dialogue is priceless. Seriously, this is one of the best and funniest over-the-top performances ever seen. Plenty of one-liners and extremely silly plot developments/dialogues will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh out loud. Apart from Russell Crowe, whose talent and joy shine through, this movie is so insanely ridiculous it's awesome. Some of the ideas are actually so preposterous and funny they're original (the "symphony", anyone?). One of the best Hollywood comedies with a Sci-Fi twist. On a side note, another thing that's funny is some humorless stiff people taking this film seriously. Loosen up, will you...

    Set in the very near future, Virtuosity explores the evil fantasy of every science fiction addict by bringing an evil virtual villain out of the computer and onto the streets. Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy. Today, with the way we are going with computers, not so much. But you have to enjoy the acting in this one as well as the plot, which is somewhat original. The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role. Denzel wasn't quite the heart throb at the time, but his portrayal of Parker Barnes is excellent, and we get to feel the characters emotions and angst as he is taunted again and again by this evil construct. Louise Fletcher is the uncaring, evil woman in charge of the virtual simulations, and she is perfectly opposed by Kelly Lynch (aka Mrs. John Travolta) throughout the film. A cameo by Traci Lords and an early performance by a 10 year old Kaley Cuoco (Penny on Big Bang Theory) round out an excellent cast and make for an entertaining film. Rated R for violence, language, and disturbing content, including sex, this is one for an afternoon or evening when you are tired of the run of the mill fare. Collectible? Not necessarily, but worth a rental.

    I bought this film awhile back for 50 cents on Amazon, just because William Fichtner was in it. I think he is a talented actor, who ranked up there among the best like Washington, Ford, Connery, etc.. Yes i am a huge Fichnter fan and he and Washington made it tolerable to watch this weird and unrealistic film. I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all, like his character SID 6.7, Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar, it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much, while most of the training is done with real instructors; and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or Sci-Fi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater, I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man, and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity. THX, Kris L. CocKayne

    Virtuosity was a big budget 90s film, that despite having a great cast, was a big flop. After I watched the film, it's fairly easy to see why. The premise of the film is that a police training, virtual reality serial killer, programmed with over 200 personalities, gets put into a robotic body and reeks havoc on LA. Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialog, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out.

    In the futuristic world of 1999, former policeman Denzel Washington (as Parker Barnes) is released from prison to help catch "virtual reality" android run amok Russell Crowe (as S.I.D. 6.7). At a disadvantage with only a bionic arm, Mr. Washington makes up the difference in determination. He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer). Crowe gets a kick out of killing people, and eats glass to rejuvenate. ***** Virtuosity (8/4/95) Brett Leonard ~ Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Kelly Lynch, Stephen Spinella

    Brett Leonard is a name that has fallen by the wayside, and, maybe rightfully so. The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite. There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY: finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

    Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called " Virtuosity. " Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****

And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

    Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called " Virtuosity. " Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****

    Another dismal clunker from Brett Leonard, also the director of such cack as 'The Lawnmower Man' and 'Hideaway'. This is slightly better than those movies but it's still a tacky cine-bin which interminably stretches out a plot that would barely get an episode of the 'Outer Limits' revival to the first commercial break. Denzel Washington is an ex-cop trying to track down virtual reality villain Russell Crowe, who was created for a police simulation using the personalities of murderous psychos and has now escaped into the real world. See, it's just balls, isn't it? Not only was this tat horribly dated ten minutes after it opened, but Leonard's fascination with cut-price CG effects continues unabated and the whole thing looks cheap as hell. What a class act like Washington is doing in this I don't know; the material is the stuff of straight-to-video cobblers.

    I mean really... How many other films of this Cyberpunk type are as fun, engaging, have such a charismatic bad guy, have friggn' DENZEL WASHINGTON for God's sake, a sharp concept, and pretty darn good execution? 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC'...??? Uh huh, with Mr Cheeeeez@ss Ice Tea, right... This film is perfectly great! It's LOTS of fun, Denzel is excellent as usual, all the supporting actors do a fine job, and I was not aware originally that Russell Crowe was the bad guy in this, but he is delightfully Evil without being so campy (like MOST similar Evil villains - can you say 'Freddy' anyone...?) Very entertaining. I cannot for the life of me see why this director after doing both 'LAWNMOWER MAN' and this film, suddenly dropped off the map. Very sad... Never really made much after this too Look, if you are NOT a bloody film snob AND you like fun Sci Fi AND if you have 1/2 a brain with imagination where you can buy into a great story like this without Bitch'n and Moan'n, THEN YES you should really enjoy this film like I just did. NO, it is not 'BLADERUNNER'; NO, it is not 'THX-1138'. And it DEFINITELY is NOT 'CHILDREN OF MEN' But... I sure as hell will sit down and watch this again before watching 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS' or 'E.T.' or other cutesy, self conscious supposed 'Sci Fi' films. Geez, a few months ago I tried to watch the Blu-ray of 'CONTACT', which is this really HIGH rated, 'serious' Sci Fi film, and it was all I could do NOT to hang myself several times. B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G.... Nah, this one's great. It has fast pacing, it has some neat effects, it has a charismatic and genuinely disturbing bad guy, it has a TINY bit of humour, just to flavour it, NOT bloody overwhelm and CHEEEEEZ it to death. It is Oscar material? No... Is it fun? HELL yeah!

    This is quite a fascinating look at early computer technology and an artifact of its time that is quite a colorful entertainment. A violent, great looking, slick Movie with a despicable Villain worth rooting for. Russell Crowe has a field day with his spot on interpretation of artificial intelligence programmed to be what he is, a psycho killer with an unforgettable sense of humor. It is all beautifully and brutally laid out in an abundance of wild state of the art SFX (for 1995) that become more over the top as it goes along and it is better for it. The ending and ticking time bomb is just a little too long and slows the momentum a bit, but til then, strap on your seat belt, put on your VR glasses, and prepare to be taken for a ride.

    The reason to watch "Virtuosity" is Russell Crowe, who's in top shape here (women will agree for sure) and clearly having the time of his life. All the scenes where he appears are hilarious, and the way he delivers the dialogue is priceless. Seriously, this is one of the best and funniest over-the-top performances ever seen. Plenty of one-liners and extremely silly plot developments/dialogues will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh out loud. Apart from Russell Crowe, whose talent and joy shine through, this movie is so insanely ridiculous it's awesome. Some of the ideas are actually so preposterous and funny they're original (the "symphony", anyone?). One of the best Hollywood comedies with a Sci-Fi twist. On a side note, another thing that's funny is some humorless stiff people taking this film seriously. Loosen up, will you...

    Set in the very near future, Virtuosity explores the evil fantasy of every science fiction addict by bringing an evil virtual villain out of the computer and onto the streets. Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy. Today, with the way we are going with computers, not so much. But you have to enjoy the acting in this one as well as the plot, which is somewhat original. The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role. Denzel wasn't quite the heart throb at the time, but his portrayal of Parker Barnes is excellent, and we get to feel the characters emotions and angst as he is taunted again and again by this evil construct. Louise Fletcher is the uncaring, evil woman in charge of the virtual simulations, and she is perfectly opposed by Kelly Lynch (aka Mrs. John Travolta) throughout the film. A cameo by Traci Lords and an early performance by a 10 year old Kaley Cuoco (Penny on Big Bang Theory) round out an excellent cast and make for an entertaining film. Rated R for violence, language, and disturbing content, including sex, this is one for an afternoon or evening when you are tired of the run of the mill fare. Collectible? Not necessarily, but worth a rental.

    I bought this film awhile back for 50 cents on Amazon, just because William Fichtner was in it. I think he is a talented actor, who ranked up there among the best like Washington, Ford, Connery, etc.. Yes i am a huge Fichnter fan and he and Washington made it tolerable to watch this weird and unrealistic film. I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all, like his character SID 6.7, Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar, it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much, while most of the training is done with real instructors; and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or Sci-Fi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater, I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man, and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity. THX, Kris L. CocKayne

    Virtuosity was a big budget 90s film, that despite having a great cast, was a big flop. After I watched the film, it's fairly easy to see why. The premise of the film is that a police training, virtual reality serial killer, programmed with over 200 personalities, gets put into a robotic body and reeks havoc on LA. Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialog, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out.

    In the futuristic world of 1999, former policeman Denzel Washington (as Parker Barnes) is released from prison to help catch "virtual reality" android run amok Russell Crowe (as S.I.D. 6.7). At a disadvantage with only a bionic arm, Mr. Washington makes up the difference in determination. He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer). Crowe gets a kick out of killing people, and eats glass to rejuvenate. ***** Virtuosity (8/4/95) Brett Leonard ~ Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Kelly Lynch, Stephen Spinella

    Brett Leonard is a name that has fallen by the wayside, and, maybe rightfully so. The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite. There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY: finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite. There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY: finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

    Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called " Virtuosity. " Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****

    Another dismal clunker from Brett Leonard, also the director of such cack as 'The Lawnmower Man' and 'Hideaway'. This is slightly better than those movies but it's still a tacky cine-bin which interminably stretches out a plot that would barely get an episode of the 'Outer Limits' revival to the first commercial break. Denzel Washington is an ex-cop trying to track down virtual reality villain Russell Crowe, who was created for a police simulation using the personalities of murderous psychos and has now escaped into the real world. See, it's just balls, isn't it? Not only was this tat horribly dated ten minutes after it opened, but Leonard's fascination with cut-price CG effects continues unabated and the whole thing looks cheap as hell. What a class act like Washington is doing in this I don't know; the material is the stuff of straight-to-video cobblers.

    I mean really... How many other films of this Cyberpunk type are as fun, engaging, have such a charismatic bad guy, have friggn' DENZEL WASHINGTON for God's sake, a sharp concept, and pretty darn good execution? 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC'...??? Uh huh, with Mr Cheeeeez@ss Ice Tea, right... This film is perfectly great! It's LOTS of fun, Denzel is excellent as usual, all the supporting actors do a fine job, and I was not aware originally that Russell Crowe was the bad guy in this, but he is delightfully Evil without being so campy (like MOST similar Evil villains - can you say 'Freddy' anyone...?) Very entertaining. I cannot for the life of me see why this director after doing both 'LAWNMOWER MAN' and this film, suddenly dropped off the map. Very sad... Never really made much after this too Look, if you are NOT a bloody film snob AND you like fun Sci Fi AND if you have 1/2 a brain with imagination where you can buy into a great story like this without Bitch'n and Moan'n, THEN YES you should really enjoy this film like I just did. NO, it is not 'BLADERUNNER'; NO, it is not 'THX-1138'. And it DEFINITELY is NOT 'CHILDREN OF MEN' But... I sure as hell will sit down and watch this again before watching 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS' or 'E.T.' or other cutesy, self conscious supposed 'Sci Fi' films. Geez, a few months ago I tried to watch the Blu-ray of 'CONTACT', which is this really HIGH rated, 'serious' Sci Fi film, and it was all I could do NOT to hang myself several times. B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G.... Nah, this one's great. It has fast pacing, it has some neat effects, it has a charismatic and genuinely disturbing bad guy, it has a TINY bit of humour, just to flavour it, NOT bloody overwhelm and CHEEEEEZ it to death. It is Oscar material? No... Is it fun? HELL yeah!

    This is quite a fascinating look at early computer technology and an artifact of its time that is quite a colorful entertainment. A violent, great looking, slick Movie with a despicable Villain worth rooting for. Russell Crowe has a field day with his spot on interpretation of artificial intelligence programmed to be what he is, a psycho killer with an unforgettable sense of humor. It is all beautifully and brutally laid out in an abundance of wild state of the art SFX (for 1995) that become more over the top as it goes along and it is better for it. The ending and ticking time bomb is just a little too long and slows the momentum a bit, but til then, strap on your seat belt, put on your VR glasses, and prepare to be taken for a ride.

    The reason to watch "Virtuosity" is Russell Crowe, who's in top shape here (women will agree for sure) and clearly having the time of his life. All the scenes where he appears are hilarious, and the way he delivers the dialogue is priceless. Seriously, this is one of the best and funniest over-the-top performances ever seen. Plenty of one-liners and extremely silly plot developments/dialogues will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh out loud. Apart from Russell Crowe, whose talent and joy shine through, this movie is so insanely ridiculous it's awesome. Some of the ideas are actually so preposterous and funny they're original (the "symphony", anyone?). One of the best Hollywood comedies with a Sci-Fi twist. On a side note, another thing that's funny is some humorless stiff people taking this film seriously. Loosen up, will you...

    Set in the very near future, Virtuosity explores the evil fantasy of every science fiction addict by bringing an evil virtual villain out of the computer and onto the streets. Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy. Today, with the way we are going with computers, not so much. But you have to enjoy the acting in this one as well as the plot, which is somewhat original. The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role. Denzel wasn't quite the heart throb at the time, but his portrayal of Parker Barnes is excellent, and we get to feel the characters emotions and angst as he is taunted again and again by this evil construct. Louise Fletcher is the uncaring, evil woman in charge of the virtual simulations, and she is perfectly opposed by Kelly Lynch (aka Mrs. John Travolta) throughout the film. A cameo by Traci Lords and an early performance by a 10 year old Kaley Cuoco (Penny on Big Bang Theory) round out an excellent cast and make for an entertaining film. Rated R for violence, language, and disturbing content, including sex, this is one for an afternoon or evening when you are tired of the run of the mill fare. Collectible? Not necessarily, but worth a rental.

    I bought this film awhile back for 50 cents on Amazon, just because William Fichtner was in it. I think he is a talented actor, who ranked up there among the best like Washington, Ford, Connery, etc.. Yes i am a huge Fichnter fan and he and Washington made it tolerable to watch this weird and unrealistic film. I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all, like his character SID 6.7, Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar, it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much, while most of the training is done with real instructors; and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or Sci-Fi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater, I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man, and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity. THX, Kris L. CocKayne

    Virtuosity was a big budget 90s film, that despite having a great cast, was a big flop. After I watched the film, it's fairly easy to see why. The premise of the film is that a police training, virtual reality serial killer, programmed with over 200 personalities, gets put into a robotic body and reeks havoc on LA. Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialog, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out.

    In the futuristic world of 1999, former policeman Denzel Washington (as Parker Barnes) is released from prison to help catch "virtual reality" android run amok Russell Crowe (as S.I.D. 6.7). At a disadvantage with only a bionic arm, Mr. Washington makes up the difference in determination. He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer). Crowe gets a kick out of killing people, and eats glass to rejuvenate. ***** Virtuosity (8/4/95) Brett Leonard ~ Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Kelly Lynch, Stephen Spinella

He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer). Crowe gets a kick out of killing people, and eats glass to rejuvenate. ***** Virtuosity (8/4/95) Brett Leonard ~ Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Kelly Lynch, Stephen Spinella

    Brett Leonard is a name that has fallen by the wayside, and, maybe rightfully so. The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite. There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY: finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

    Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called " Virtuosity. " Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****

    Another dismal clunker from Brett Leonard, also the director of such cack as 'The Lawnmower Man' and 'Hideaway'. This is slightly better than those movies but it's still a tacky cine-bin which interminably stretches out a plot that would barely get an episode of the 'Outer Limits' revival to the first commercial break. Denzel Washington is an ex-cop trying to track down virtual reality villain Russell Crowe, who was created for a police simulation using the personalities of murderous psychos and has now escaped into the real world. See, it's just balls, isn't it? Not only was this tat horribly dated ten minutes after it opened, but Leonard's fascination with cut-price CG effects continues unabated and the whole thing looks cheap as hell. What a class act like Washington is doing in this I don't know; the material is the stuff of straight-to-video cobblers.

    I mean really... How many other films of this Cyberpunk type are as fun, engaging, have such a charismatic bad guy, have friggn' DENZEL WASHINGTON for God's sake, a sharp concept, and pretty darn good execution? 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC'...??? Uh huh, with Mr Cheeeeez@ss Ice Tea, right... This film is perfectly great! It's LOTS of fun, Denzel is excellent as usual, all the supporting actors do a fine job, and I was not aware originally that Russell Crowe was the bad guy in this, but he is delightfully Evil without being so campy (like MOST similar Evil villains - can you say 'Freddy' anyone...?) Very entertaining. I cannot for the life of me see why this director after doing both 'LAWNMOWER MAN' and this film, suddenly dropped off the map. Very sad... Never really made much after this too Look, if you are NOT a bloody film snob AND you like fun Sci Fi AND if you have 1/2 a brain with imagination where you can buy into a great story like this without Bitch'n and Moan'n, THEN YES you should really enjoy this film like I just did. NO, it is not 'BLADERUNNER'; NO, it is not 'THX-1138'. And it DEFINITELY is NOT 'CHILDREN OF MEN' But... I sure as hell will sit down and watch this again before watching 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS' or 'E.T.' or other cutesy, self conscious supposed 'Sci Fi' films. Geez, a few months ago I tried to watch the Blu-ray of 'CONTACT', which is this really HIGH rated, 'serious' Sci Fi film, and it was all I could do NOT to hang myself several times. B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G.... Nah, this one's great. It has fast pacing, it has some neat effects, it has a charismatic and genuinely disturbing bad guy, it has a TINY bit of humour, just to flavour it, NOT bloody overwhelm and CHEEEEEZ it to death. It is Oscar material? No... Is it fun? HELL yeah!

    This is quite a fascinating look at early computer technology and an artifact of its time that is quite a colorful entertainment. A violent, great looking, slick Movie with a despicable Villain worth rooting for. Russell Crowe has a field day with his spot on interpretation of artificial intelligence programmed to be what he is, a psycho killer with an unforgettable sense of humor. It is all beautifully and brutally laid out in an abundance of wild state of the art SFX (for 1995) that become more over the top as it goes along and it is better for it. The ending and ticking time bomb is just a little too long and slows the momentum a bit, but til then, strap on your seat belt, put on your VR glasses, and prepare to be taken for a ride.

    The reason to watch "Virtuosity" is Russell Crowe, who's in top shape here (women will agree for sure) and clearly having the time of his life. All the scenes where he appears are hilarious, and the way he delivers the dialogue is priceless. Seriously, this is one of the best and funniest over-the-top performances ever seen. Plenty of one-liners and extremely silly plot developments/dialogues will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh out loud. Apart from Russell Crowe, whose talent and joy shine through, this movie is so insanely ridiculous it's awesome. Some of the ideas are actually so preposterous and funny they're original (the "symphony", anyone?). One of the best Hollywood comedies with a Sci-Fi twist. On a side note, another thing that's funny is some humorless stiff people taking this film seriously. Loosen up, will you...

    Set in the very near future, Virtuosity explores the evil fantasy of every science fiction addict by bringing an evil virtual villain out of the computer and onto the streets. Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy. Today, with the way we are going with computers, not so much. But you have to enjoy the acting in this one as well as the plot, which is somewhat original. The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role. Denzel wasn't quite the heart throb at the time, but his portrayal of Parker Barnes is excellent, and we get to feel the characters emotions and angst as he is taunted again and again by this evil construct. Louise Fletcher is the uncaring, evil woman in charge of the virtual simulations, and she is perfectly opposed by Kelly Lynch (aka Mrs. John Travolta) throughout the film. A cameo by Traci Lords and an early performance by a 10 year old Kaley Cuoco (Penny on Big Bang Theory) round out an excellent cast and make for an entertaining film. Rated R for violence, language, and disturbing content, including sex, this is one for an afternoon or evening when you are tired of the run of the mill fare. Collectible? Not necessarily, but worth a rental.

    I bought this film awhile back for 50 cents on Amazon, just because William Fichtner was in it. I think he is a talented actor, who ranked up there among the best like Washington, Ford, Connery, etc.. Yes i am a huge Fichnter fan and he and Washington made it tolerable to watch this weird and unrealistic film. I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all, like his character SID 6.7, Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar, it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much, while most of the training is done with real instructors; and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or Sci-Fi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater, I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man, and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity. THX, Kris L. CocKayne

    Virtuosity was a big budget 90s film, that despite having a great cast, was a big flop. After I watched the film, it's fairly easy to see why. The premise of the film is that a police training, virtual reality serial killer, programmed with over 200 personalities, gets put into a robotic body and reeks havoc on LA. Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialog, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out.

It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialog, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out.

    In the futuristic world of 1999, former policeman Denzel Washington (as Parker Barnes) is released from prison to help catch "virtual reality" android run amok Russell Crowe (as S.I.D. 6.7). At a disadvantage with only a bionic arm, Mr. Washington makes up the difference in determination. He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer). Crowe gets a kick out of killing people, and eats glass to rejuvenate. ***** Virtuosity (8/4/95) Brett Leonard ~ Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Kelly Lynch, Stephen Spinella

    Brett Leonard is a name that has fallen by the wayside, and, maybe rightfully so. The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite. There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY: finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on. Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own. Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

    Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called " Virtuosity. " Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****
