  James Bond teams up with the lone survivor of a destroyed Russian research center to stop the hijacking of a nuclear space weapon by a fellow agent believed to be dead.

  When a deadly satellite weapon system falls into the wrong hands, only Agent 007 can save the world from certain disaster. Armed with his license to kill, Bond races to Russia in search of the stolen access codes for "Goldeneye," an awesome space weapon that can fire a devastating electromagnetic pulse toward Earth. But 007 is up against an enemy who anticipates his every move: a mastermind motivated by years of simmering hatred.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

Sean Bean 4. Judi Dench as 'M' 5. Minnie Drivers cameo as the Russian singer singing 'Stand By Your Man' 6. Alan Cumming as Boris 7. A chase through the streets of Moscow IN A TANK! 8. The opening scene rocked! 9. Q - it's always nice to see what Q has in store 10. The movie just rocked. They really brought Bond back in a big way with this movie. I was VERY VERY happy with the entire movie. I don't think anyone does it better than Bond! If you want a good starting off point for a Bond flick, go with this one!

The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress.

(Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies.

Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society.

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    1. Tina Turner sings the opening song with music by Bono and The Edge of the band U2. 2. Famke Jenssen (Jean Gray from the X-Men films) as baddie, thigh crushing killer Xenia Onatopp 3. Sean Bean 4. Judi Dench as 'M' 5. Minnie Drivers cameo as the Russian singer singing 'Stand By Your Man' 6. Alan Cumming as Boris 7. A chase through the streets of Moscow IN A TANK! 8. The opening scene rocked! 9. Q - it's always nice to see what Q has in store 10. The movie just rocked. They really brought Bond back in a big way with this movie. I was VERY VERY happy with the entire movie. I don't think anyone does it better than Bond! If you want a good starting off point for a Bond flick, go with this one!

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress.

The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

    Goldeneye is such a good Bond film that iconoclasts have a go at knocking it before admitting, yes, they enjoyed it too. It is a bold stab at rejuvenating a failing franchise which works 90% of the time. It is principally an ensemble piece and its the cast that really makes the film. Famke Jansson's role as Onatop is legendary. Even on review a dozen years of more later, it is still peerless. Her fight with Bond in the Sauna is the sexiest scene in Bond history, period. And she orgasms her way through the film peerlessly. Sure its a juvenile fantasy, but what a ride. However, the Bond girl, Natalia (Izabella Scorupco) trumps her in my opinion. Rocking the film in a cardigan and a pair of passion killers she's a witty, charming nerd played by an actress who gives it her all. Given that this is Judi Dench's first film as M, and she more than absolutely nails her four or five lines and we can conclude that the girls rule this film. Not that the boys are far behind. My only complaint is that Natalia seems to spend much of the film apparently sporting a dead fox on her head. Sean Bean is a great villain (if not playing a Bond clich&eacute;), Alan Cumming (Boris) is consistently funny. Gottfired John just LOOKs like a villain and the cameos from Robbie Coltrane and Joe Don Baker are the cherries on an already full cake. I know I shouldn't laugh after all these years, but I still do when Bond's clich&eacute; finish is interrupted by the CIA. You may notice there is one omission - Brosnan himself. He doesn't quite get it together for this film in my opinion. Whereas Natalia and Boris show great chemistry (their fight on the second satellite also still makes me chuckle), Natalia and Bond don't show any chemistry, and the one main weakness of the film is that you are never convinced that these two ever get on, let alone fall in love with each other. (Id also like to take issue with the horrible gusset shot - is that supposed to be seductive?). You can only blame Brosnan for this lack of chemistry. IMHO, he is much better in Tomorrow Never Dies - an otherwise inferior film in every other way. The plot is so-so. The issue is that the super weapon is EMP and not explosive so it never appears to be threatening, but this is a rare Bond film where the plot doesn't matter - the cast is SO good - it could almost do away with the plot. The action sequences are good - there's a tank with a statue on its head - honestly what more do you want. So enjoy it - its an incredibly pleasurable film! PS. Minnie Driver's Stand By Your Man is in this film. Still another chuckle in a film full of them

    Goldeneye means a lot to me. I grew up on the Nintendo 64 game, and it leaded me to this movie because I loved the game so much. I would spend literally hours playing the game, and my Dad surprised me one day by buying the movie for me. I watched this movie over and over to the point where I know it by heart. It has many standout action scenes to get your blood pumping, along with many twists and turns. One twist is perhaps the best one in the entire Bond series involving Sean Bean. Pierce Brosnan made his Bond debut in this one, and it's auspicious to say the least. He looks comfortable right from the outset, and is fully adept at playing the action man. He was awesome, but wasn't able to duplicate this performance in future films, despite always being a great Bond. Izabella Scorupco is rather bland to look at, but she had her own brand of charm as the Bond girl. I enjoyed her for the most part. Sean Bean is utterly fantastic. He played off Brosnan extremely well, and he'll stick in your mind. Famkee Janssen's aggressive style was mesmerizing to watch. She is downright vindictive, cunning, and remorseless, and to top it all off, the definition of sexiness. Alan Cumming plays hilarious comedic relief. (YES! I AM INVINCIBLE!) Sorry. I couldn't resist adding that quote. Joe Don Baker adds class to his role. He appeared in "Living Daylights" as well Final Thoughts: This is a fantastic Bond film, there is no other way to put it. It's full of action, and everything you love about James Bond. I just hope you think it's as special as I do! 8.7/10

    A Bond film worthy of being best! Goldeneye stands 3rd on my list where I have ranked the Bond films from worst to best. There was a 6 year break since Licence to Kill was made in 1989. Licence To Kill is one of the best Bond films of all time in my opinion but there was not much liking to the film by others as Bond went serious in that film. Due to the other not so good films before Licence to kill, the creators of Bond said they would end the Bond film series until Goldeneye came along and pretty much saved the day. Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.

Goldeneye is Pierce Brosnans first performance as Bond and is very good. As James Bond in this film, Peirce Brosnan makes the character very cool and smooth. Although this is probably Pierce Brosnans only good Bond film. It has action packed scenes round every corner, including the great tank chase. Goldeneye has a very fair place as 3rd on my list and it seems that the film film is always exciting to watch.

    After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M' And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.

    Pierce Brosnan makes his mark as James Bond in "GoldenEye" after the Bonds pretty much came to a halt amid lawsuits and languished for several years after Timothy Dalton's rein as 007. Another disgruntled British Intelligence agent wants to make Great Britain pay for its treachery toward him. Sean Bean make a first-class villain and the pre-credit scene where Bond skydives to get behind the controls of a plunging plane is top-notch stuff. In fact, all the villains were rather well done, but the overall plot remains as formulaic as the previous entries, though this entry is romantic with a cute heroine. The scene in the helicopter where Bond has to use his head to escape is fabulous. The only thing that I didn't care for to this date is Bond's appearance in a toilet where he suspends himself upside down and punches out a guard. The Tina Turner theme song is memorable and the credits with the gals smashing statues of Lenin is cool.

    Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what! Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). There are a few compensationsa truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destructionbut overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.

    A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board. While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly. It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation. The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.

    *Spoiler/plot- Goldeneye, 1995, In Russia there is a search for top secret space weapon in orbit that works on devastating electromagnetic pulse theory. A fellow British agent turn coat mastermind is behind the world's problems due to holding a long vendetta against the Western governments. *Special Stars- Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen *Theme- Secret space weapons and the Cold War heats up for awhile. *Trivia/location/goofs- This was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond. The satellite dish at the end of the film is the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Final James Bond movie viewed by Albert R. Broccoli, the series long-time producer. First 007 movie in the series to feature a female - Judi Dench - in the role of M. This was the first time a German sports car, in this case the BMW Z3, was used as the primary Bond vehicle. First of two appearances by Joe Don Baker as Bond's CIA counterpart Jack Wade, who would also appear in Tomorrow Never Dies. Wade was created as a replacement for Felix Leiter, who had lost his leg and presumably retired from field work as a result. *Emotion- Essentially all European filming locations. Izabella Scorupco character in this film is wonderfully strong & complex and sexy as the computer programmer. The female villains is unique and memorable. A new female lady "M" was a nice touch and well performed. The new Ms. Moneypenny actress was lovely and well acted, but I miss the previous established actress. Seeing more of the brother agents like 006 in this story gives the viewer more background and understanding about the secret agent society. An action packed secret agent saga up to the standards set my Mr. Fleming.

    After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance. The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here. The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.
