    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it.

Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more.

There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well.

Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD.

It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.

    A pair of Miami cops have 72 hours to find some drugs that have been stolen right out of Police Headquarters. Will Smith and Martin Laurence give great performances as the buddy cops. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckenheimer did a great job with this, those names are synonomous with action adventure movies. this movie has it all lot's of great car chases,, gunplay, tons of great on liners, an all around great movie to watch. the two buddy cops must face adversity and setbacks as they try and get the drugs back, from the people who stole it,, also in the movie the buddy cops have to impersonate each other,, as the main witness will only talk to the one cop , who she has not seen,, and since he's not there, the other cop must impersonate him,, very decent movie, with tons of action.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.

    (Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointÂ…Cheers.) Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clich&eacute;s, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.

    Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clich&eacute;d left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.

    Bad Boys is a great movie with a great storyline,great action and a fantastic cast.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith did a fantastic job as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery.However,I think that Will Smith should have had a Mainer role than Martin Lawrence,because hes a bigger actor and has appeared in much better movies than Martin Lawrence,for example,while Will Smith was busy with Men In Black,Martin Lawrence was busy with Big Mommas House.Its probably the best movie directed by Michael Bay,a director that has disappointed people with his movies many times before,particularly with his Transformers franchise,which he is currently making a fourth installment of with a completely new cast. Two detectives,Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence),protect a woman who has witnessed a murder in Mikes apartment,along with her two dogs,while they both investigate a case of stolen heroine.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem. The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man. When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back. While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films. Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people. While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clich&eacute;s, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, T&eacute;a Leoni, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.

    Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch. Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old clich&eacute; there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time. But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.

    What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list. This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90â€²s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day! Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.

    Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case. 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters.... A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna. This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons. It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star. It gave us Michael Bay and his editing. It's Lethal Weapon for generation X. It made Martin Lawrence endearing. Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies. The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain. It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.

    This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a caf&eacute;, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.
