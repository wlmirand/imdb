    Robert Redford's three-hour patience tester is pretty to look at but boring as hell. Thomas Newman's very Thomas Newman score has some beautiful moments and there are bits and pieces to admire here and there, but cutting several thousand minutes may have helped render the film slightly more bearable. It's over-directed and overlong, taking an age to spin out its simple, clich&eacute;d story with its cardboard characters and cheesy scenes of family life. Scarlett Johanssen's irritating, while Kristin Scott Thomas goes into facial acting overdrive and battles with Sam Neill in a contest to produce the least locatable accent. All this congeals at a sadistically slow pace. It's a trial.

    Based on the novel of 1995 The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans, a drama directed and starred by Robert Redford. The Horse Whisperer tells the story of Grace Mc Lean (Scarlett Johansson) a teenager whose passion is horseback riding. In a particular morning she gathers with her best friend Judith (Kate Botsworth), to ride their hoses (Pilgrim and Gulliver). A very unfortunate accident leaves Grace, and Pilgrim in a very painful situation. Grace's mother, who happens to be a workaholic magazine editor (Kristin Scott Thomas), feels that Pilgrim's healing is related to her daughter's recovery. In a desperate way to save her daughter she drives all the way to Montana to find one of those special men called "Horse Whisperers" (Robert Redford). A little bit long, but filled with emotions, love, and hope.

    Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998Â…The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more. I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories: One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.

    The Horse Whisperer is a film directed by and starring Robert Redford,who plays the title role as a Montana rancher named Tom Booker,a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses and that is hired to help an injured teenager and her horse to go back to health following a tragic accident.Kristin Scott Thomas,Sam Neill,Dianne Wiest and Scarlett Johansson co-star in the film to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese,which is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Evans. Fourteen-year-old Grace MacLean and her friend Judith go horseback riding in upstate New York on a winter morning, but their horses lose their footing on ice and slide onto a road, where Judith and her horse are killed by a jackknifing truck. Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean. Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

    A movie is not bad or good. It is often about how we relate and what moves us. This movie reminds me of a love I had in my life. The horse reminded me of my partner. He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, "I never ask why it happens". When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, "Hope is greater than fear"? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation. The movie is about love, guilt, trust, fear, what cannot be seen and the hope for understanding. It's about the sacrifices we make for love.

    I was actually enjoying the movie for a bit. It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of "The Horse Whisperer" were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This "training" method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

    Robert Redford has directed a Masterpiece. The Horse Whisperer is a Classic film. There are comments posted here saying: "It's good, but the book was so, so much better." Perhaps, but overall, the shear logistics of assembling such an effort- actors, casting, crew, set design, costumes, sound, lighting, editing, and too many others to mention- simply boggles the mind; purely directorial genius in motion. The talent, gifts, trademark modesty and class of this man are reflected in every movie he takes on...whether in front of or behind the cameras. Thank you, Mr. Redford, for sharing this beautiful film with us. It is indeed a Classic.

    Horse, teen, mother and gentleman: all with broken past, all with something to heal. While the main theme is about an excellent horse trainer and his work with a horse that needs help, the movie deftly intertwines all four main characters into a movie of redemption, love and renewed life. Solid performances by all cast members combined with outstanding outdoor settings, this movie has the ability to sweep you along in its story. You'll cringe, laugh, cry, worry and smile right along with the people and animals you're watching. 8 out of 10 for me; they just don't make 'em like this much anymore. Worth the watch, trust me.

    Though the movie and the book differ quite a lot, this movie had some wonderful and beautiful scenery, scenes and places i would love to see myself one day. The love story should have evolved more in the movie to create a better reflection of the movie. If i had to choose, i would say, the book was wonderful until the very end, but the movie was just as great, if only the love story had continued with the family leaving and giving them those few days. Ending in the book is predictable. Though, i still believe that Robert Redford is the most beautiful man ever and in this movie, he proves being a charming man and Kristin Scott Thomas is just great as Annie A lovely movie. One i have seen many times.

    This film came out in 1998, however I've never been compelled to watch it before until I came across the documentary "Buck" at my local library. It's the story of Buck Brannaman, listed in the closing credits of "The Horse Whisperer" as an 'equine technical adviser'. In real life, one might call Brannaman a horse whisperer, someone who's made working with horses his life's endeavor and has an unusual, almost spiritual connection to the animals he trains and works with. There's a scene in "The Horse Whisperer" that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left. Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story. The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch. Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - "Trust me just one more time".

I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch. Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - "Trust me just one more time".

    Robert Redford's three-hour patience tester is pretty to look at but boring as hell. Thomas Newman's very Thomas Newman score has some beautiful moments and there are bits and pieces to admire here and there, but cutting several thousand minutes may have helped render the film slightly more bearable. It's over-directed and overlong, taking an age to spin out its simple, clich&eacute;d story with its cardboard characters and cheesy scenes of family life. Scarlett Johanssen's irritating, while Kristin Scott Thomas goes into facial acting overdrive and battles with Sam Neill in a contest to produce the least locatable accent. All this congeals at a sadistically slow pace. It's a trial.

    Based on the novel of 1995 The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans, a drama directed and starred by Robert Redford. The Horse Whisperer tells the story of Grace Mc Lean (Scarlett Johansson) a teenager whose passion is horseback riding. In a particular morning she gathers with her best friend Judith (Kate Botsworth), to ride their hoses (Pilgrim and Gulliver). A very unfortunate accident leaves Grace, and Pilgrim in a very painful situation. Grace's mother, who happens to be a workaholic magazine editor (Kristin Scott Thomas), feels that Pilgrim's healing is related to her daughter's recovery. In a desperate way to save her daughter she drives all the way to Montana to find one of those special men called "Horse Whisperers" (Robert Redford). A little bit long, but filled with emotions, love, and hope.

    Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998Â…The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more. I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories: One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.

    The Horse Whisperer is a film directed by and starring Robert Redford,who plays the title role as a Montana rancher named Tom Booker,a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses and that is hired to help an injured teenager and her horse to go back to health following a tragic accident.Kristin Scott Thomas,Sam Neill,Dianne Wiest and Scarlett Johansson co-star in the film to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese,which is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Evans. Fourteen-year-old Grace MacLean and her friend Judith go horseback riding in upstate New York on a winter morning, but their horses lose their footing on ice and slide onto a road, where Judith and her horse are killed by a jackknifing truck. Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean. Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

    A movie is not bad or good. It is often about how we relate and what moves us. This movie reminds me of a love I had in my life. The horse reminded me of my partner. He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, "I never ask why it happens". When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, "Hope is greater than fear"? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation. The movie is about love, guilt, trust, fear, what cannot be seen and the hope for understanding. It's about the sacrifices we make for love.

    I was actually enjoying the movie for a bit. It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of "The Horse Whisperer" were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This "training" method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

    Robert Redford has directed a Masterpiece. The Horse Whisperer is a Classic film. There are comments posted here saying: "It's good, but the book was so, so much better." Perhaps, but overall, the shear logistics of assembling such an effort- actors, casting, crew, set design, costumes, sound, lighting, editing, and too many others to mention- simply boggles the mind; purely directorial genius in motion. The talent, gifts, trademark modesty and class of this man are reflected in every movie he takes on...whether in front of or behind the cameras. Thank you, Mr. Redford, for sharing this beautiful film with us. It is indeed a Classic.

    Horse, teen, mother and gentleman: all with broken past, all with something to heal. While the main theme is about an excellent horse trainer and his work with a horse that needs help, the movie deftly intertwines all four main characters into a movie of redemption, love and renewed life. Solid performances by all cast members combined with outstanding outdoor settings, this movie has the ability to sweep you along in its story. You'll cringe, laugh, cry, worry and smile right along with the people and animals you're watching. 8 out of 10 for me; they just don't make 'em like this much anymore. Worth the watch, trust me.

    Though the movie and the book differ quite a lot, this movie had some wonderful and beautiful scenery, scenes and places i would love to see myself one day. The love story should have evolved more in the movie to create a better reflection of the movie. If i had to choose, i would say, the book was wonderful until the very end, but the movie was just as great, if only the love story had continued with the family leaving and giving them those few days. Ending in the book is predictable. Though, i still believe that Robert Redford is the most beautiful man ever and in this movie, he proves being a charming man and Kristin Scott Thomas is just great as Annie A lovely movie. One i have seen many times.

    This film came out in 1998, however I've never been compelled to watch it before until I came across the documentary "Buck" at my local library. It's the story of Buck Brannaman, listed in the closing credits of "The Horse Whisperer" as an 'equine technical adviser'. In real life, one might call Brannaman a horse whisperer, someone who's made working with horses his life's endeavor and has an unusual, almost spiritual connection to the animals he trains and works with. There's a scene in "The Horse Whisperer" that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left. Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story. The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses.

    Robert Redford's three-hour patience tester is pretty to look at but boring as hell. Thomas Newman's very Thomas Newman score has some beautiful moments and there are bits and pieces to admire here and there, but cutting several thousand minutes may have helped render the film slightly more bearable. It's over-directed and overlong, taking an age to spin out its simple, clich&eacute;d story with its cardboard characters and cheesy scenes of family life. Scarlett Johanssen's irritating, while Kristin Scott Thomas goes into facial acting overdrive and battles with Sam Neill in a contest to produce the least locatable accent. All this congeals at a sadistically slow pace. It's a trial.

    Based on the novel of 1995 The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans, a drama directed and starred by Robert Redford. The Horse Whisperer tells the story of Grace Mc Lean (Scarlett Johansson) a teenager whose passion is horseback riding. In a particular morning she gathers with her best friend Judith (Kate Botsworth), to ride their hoses (Pilgrim and Gulliver). A very unfortunate accident leaves Grace, and Pilgrim in a very painful situation. Grace's mother, who happens to be a workaholic magazine editor (Kristin Scott Thomas), feels that Pilgrim's healing is related to her daughter's recovery. In a desperate way to save her daughter she drives all the way to Montana to find one of those special men called "Horse Whisperers" (Robert Redford). A little bit long, but filled with emotions, love, and hope.

    Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998Â…The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more. I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories: One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.

    The Horse Whisperer is a film directed by and starring Robert Redford,who plays the title role as a Montana rancher named Tom Booker,a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses and that is hired to help an injured teenager and her horse to go back to health following a tragic accident.Kristin Scott Thomas,Sam Neill,Dianne Wiest and Scarlett Johansson co-star in the film to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese,which is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Evans. Fourteen-year-old Grace MacLean and her friend Judith go horseback riding in upstate New York on a winter morning, but their horses lose their footing on ice and slide onto a road, where Judith and her horse are killed by a jackknifing truck. Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean. Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

    A movie is not bad or good. It is often about how we relate and what moves us. This movie reminds me of a love I had in my life. The horse reminded me of my partner. He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, "I never ask why it happens". When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, "Hope is greater than fear"? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation. The movie is about love, guilt, trust, fear, what cannot be seen and the hope for understanding. It's about the sacrifices we make for love.

    I was actually enjoying the movie for a bit. It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of "The Horse Whisperer" were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This "training" method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

    Robert Redford has directed a Masterpiece. The Horse Whisperer is a Classic film. There are comments posted here saying: "It's good, but the book was so, so much better." Perhaps, but overall, the shear logistics of assembling such an effort- actors, casting, crew, set design, costumes, sound, lighting, editing, and too many others to mention- simply boggles the mind; purely directorial genius in motion. The talent, gifts, trademark modesty and class of this man are reflected in every movie he takes on...whether in front of or behind the cameras. Thank you, Mr. Redford, for sharing this beautiful film with us. It is indeed a Classic.

    Horse, teen, mother and gentleman: all with broken past, all with something to heal. While the main theme is about an excellent horse trainer and his work with a horse that needs help, the movie deftly intertwines all four main characters into a movie of redemption, love and renewed life. Solid performances by all cast members combined with outstanding outdoor settings, this movie has the ability to sweep you along in its story. You'll cringe, laugh, cry, worry and smile right along with the people and animals you're watching. 8 out of 10 for me; they just don't make 'em like this much anymore. Worth the watch, trust me.

    Though the movie and the book differ quite a lot, this movie had some wonderful and beautiful scenery, scenes and places i would love to see myself one day. The love story should have evolved more in the movie to create a better reflection of the movie. If i had to choose, i would say, the book was wonderful until the very end, but the movie was just as great, if only the love story had continued with the family leaving and giving them those few days. Ending in the book is predictable. Though, i still believe that Robert Redford is the most beautiful man ever and in this movie, he proves being a charming man and Kristin Scott Thomas is just great as Annie A lovely movie. One i have seen many times.

    This film came out in 1998, however I've never been compelled to watch it before until I came across the documentary "Buck" at my local library. It's the story of Buck Brannaman, listed in the closing credits of "The Horse Whisperer" as an 'equine technical adviser'. In real life, one might call Brannaman a horse whisperer, someone who's made working with horses his life's endeavor and has an unusual, almost spiritual connection to the animals he trains and works with. There's a scene in "The Horse Whisperer" that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left. Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story. The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch. Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - "Trust me just one more time".

In a desperate way to save her daughter she drives all the way to Montana to find one of those special men called "Horse Whisperers" (Robert Redford). A little bit long, but filled with emotions, love, and hope.

    Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998Â…The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more. I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories: One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.

    The Horse Whisperer is a film directed by and starring Robert Redford,who plays the title role as a Montana rancher named Tom Booker,a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses and that is hired to help an injured teenager and her horse to go back to health following a tragic accident.Kristin Scott Thomas,Sam Neill,Dianne Wiest and Scarlett Johansson co-star in the film to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese,which is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Evans. Fourteen-year-old Grace MacLean and her friend Judith go horseback riding in upstate New York on a winter morning, but their horses lose their footing on ice and slide onto a road, where Judith and her horse are killed by a jackknifing truck. Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean. Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

    A movie is not bad or good. It is often about how we relate and what moves us. This movie reminds me of a love I had in my life. The horse reminded me of my partner. He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, "I never ask why it happens". When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, "Hope is greater than fear"? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation. The movie is about love, guilt, trust, fear, what cannot be seen and the hope for understanding. It's about the sacrifices we make for love.

    I was actually enjoying the movie for a bit. It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of "The Horse Whisperer" were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This "training" method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

    Robert Redford has directed a Masterpiece. The Horse Whisperer is a Classic film. There are comments posted here saying: "It's good, but the book was so, so much better." Perhaps, but overall, the shear logistics of assembling such an effort- actors, casting, crew, set design, costumes, sound, lighting, editing, and too many others to mention- simply boggles the mind; purely directorial genius in motion. The talent, gifts, trademark modesty and class of this man are reflected in every movie he takes on...whether in front of or behind the cameras. Thank you, Mr. Redford, for sharing this beautiful film with us. It is indeed a Classic.

    Horse, teen, mother and gentleman: all with broken past, all with something to heal. While the main theme is about an excellent horse trainer and his work with a horse that needs help, the movie deftly intertwines all four main characters into a movie of redemption, love and renewed life. Solid performances by all cast members combined with outstanding outdoor settings, this movie has the ability to sweep you along in its story. You'll cringe, laugh, cry, worry and smile right along with the people and animals you're watching. 8 out of 10 for me; they just don't make 'em like this much anymore. Worth the watch, trust me.

    Though the movie and the book differ quite a lot, this movie had some wonderful and beautiful scenery, scenes and places i would love to see myself one day. The love story should have evolved more in the movie to create a better reflection of the movie. If i had to choose, i would say, the book was wonderful until the very end, but the movie was just as great, if only the love story had continued with the family leaving and giving them those few days. Ending in the book is predictable. Though, i still believe that Robert Redford is the most beautiful man ever and in this movie, he proves being a charming man and Kristin Scott Thomas is just great as Annie A lovely movie. One i have seen many times.

    This film came out in 1998, however I've never been compelled to watch it before until I came across the documentary "Buck" at my local library. It's the story of Buck Brannaman, listed in the closing credits of "The Horse Whisperer" as an 'equine technical adviser'. In real life, one might call Brannaman a horse whisperer, someone who's made working with horses his life's endeavor and has an unusual, almost spiritual connection to the animals he trains and works with. There's a scene in "The Horse Whisperer" that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left. Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story. The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch. Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - "Trust me just one more time".

    Robert Redford's three-hour patience tester is pretty to look at but boring as hell. Thomas Newman's very Thomas Newman score has some beautiful moments and there are bits and pieces to admire here and there, but cutting several thousand minutes may have helped render the film slightly more bearable. It's over-directed and overlong, taking an age to spin out its simple, clich&eacute;d story with its cardboard characters and cheesy scenes of family life. Scarlett Johanssen's irritating, while Kristin Scott Thomas goes into facial acting overdrive and battles with Sam Neill in a contest to produce the least locatable accent. All this congeals at a sadistically slow pace. It's a trial.

    Talk about being almost completely snubbed at the Oscars in 1998Â…The Horse Whisperer is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous score, excellent acting, deep messages, perfect mix of humor and tragedy and deliberately slow-paced to absorb it all the more. I tear up every time I see the daughter breaking down, I've listened to the score 10x more than I've seen the movie and my this is one of my favorite movie stories: One of my many, many Vegas trips caught me tiring tremendously on day four of four. While my friends wanted to walk the strip and window shop, I was hot, tired and all-but broke. I decided on my first (of just a few) movie(s) I'll see in Las Vegas. It was a cool theatre, no one hardly was in there and it was a very long and slow movie I absolutely needed at that time. This experience was one of my favorites because it fit my mood, lifted my spirits (again, broke) and it was a great movie, to boot.

    The Horse Whisperer is a film directed by and starring Robert Redford,who plays the title role as a Montana rancher named Tom Booker,a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses and that is hired to help an injured teenager and her horse to go back to health following a tragic accident.Kristin Scott Thomas,Sam Neill,Dianne Wiest and Scarlett Johansson co-star in the film to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese,which is based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Evans. Fourteen-year-old Grace MacLean and her friend Judith go horseback riding in upstate New York on a winter morning, but their horses lose their footing on ice and slide onto a road, where Judith and her horse are killed by a jackknifing truck. Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean. Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

    A movie is not bad or good. It is often about how we relate and what moves us. This movie reminds me of a love I had in my life. The horse reminded me of my partner. He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, "I never ask why it happens". When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, "Hope is greater than fear"? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation. The movie is about love, guilt, trust, fear, what cannot be seen and the hope for understanding. It's about the sacrifices we make for love.

    I was actually enjoying the movie for a bit. It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of "The Horse Whisperer" were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This "training" method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

    Robert Redford has directed a Masterpiece. The Horse Whisperer is a Classic film. There are comments posted here saying: "It's good, but the book was so, so much better." Perhaps, but overall, the shear logistics of assembling such an effort- actors, casting, crew, set design, costumes, sound, lighting, editing, and too many others to mention- simply boggles the mind; purely directorial genius in motion. The talent, gifts, trademark modesty and class of this man are reflected in every movie he takes on...whether in front of or behind the cameras. Thank you, Mr. Redford, for sharing this beautiful film with us. It is indeed a Classic.

    Horse, teen, mother and gentleman: all with broken past, all with something to heal. While the main theme is about an excellent horse trainer and his work with a horse that needs help, the movie deftly intertwines all four main characters into a movie of redemption, love and renewed life. Solid performances by all cast members combined with outstanding outdoor settings, this movie has the ability to sweep you along in its story. You'll cringe, laugh, cry, worry and smile right along with the people and animals you're watching. 8 out of 10 for me; they just don't make 'em like this much anymore. Worth the watch, trust me.

    Though the movie and the book differ quite a lot, this movie had some wonderful and beautiful scenery, scenes and places i would love to see myself one day. The love story should have evolved more in the movie to create a better reflection of the movie. If i had to choose, i would say, the book was wonderful until the very end, but the movie was just as great, if only the love story had continued with the family leaving and giving them those few days. Ending in the book is predictable. Though, i still believe that Robert Redford is the most beautiful man ever and in this movie, he proves being a charming man and Kristin Scott Thomas is just great as Annie A lovely movie. One i have seen many times.

    This film came out in 1998, however I've never been compelled to watch it before until I came across the documentary "Buck" at my local library. It's the story of Buck Brannaman, listed in the closing credits of "The Horse Whisperer" as an 'equine technical adviser'. In real life, one might call Brannaman a horse whisperer, someone who's made working with horses his life's endeavor and has an unusual, almost spiritual connection to the animals he trains and works with. There's a scene in "The Horse Whisperer" that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left. Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story. The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch. Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - "Trust me just one more time".

    Robert Redford's three-hour patience tester is pretty to look at but boring as hell. Thomas Newman's very Thomas Newman score has some beautiful moments and there are bits and pieces to admire here and there, but cutting several thousand minutes may have helped render the film slightly more bearable. It's over-directed and overlong, taking an age to spin out its simple, clich&eacute;d story with its cardboard characters and cheesy scenes of family life. Scarlett Johanssen's irritating, while Kristin Scott Thomas goes into facial acting overdrive and battles with Sam Neill in a contest to produce the least locatable accent. All this congeals at a sadistically slow pace. It's a trial.

    Based on the novel of 1995 The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans, a drama directed and starred by Robert Redford. The Horse Whisperer tells the story of Grace Mc Lean (Scarlett Johansson) a teenager whose passion is horseback riding. In a particular morning she gathers with her best friend Judith (Kate Botsworth), to ride their hoses (Pilgrim and Gulliver). A very unfortunate accident leaves Grace, and Pilgrim in a very painful situation. Grace's mother, who happens to be a workaholic magazine editor (Kristin Scott Thomas), feels that Pilgrim's healing is related to her daughter's recovery. In a desperate way to save her daughter she drives all the way to Montana to find one of those special men called "Horse Whisperers" (Robert Redford). A little bit long, but filled with emotions, love, and hope.
