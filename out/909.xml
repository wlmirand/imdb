 <sinopse>
  A Venetian courtesan becomes a hero to her city, but later becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 16th century Venice, courtesans enjoy unique privileges: dressed richly in red, they read, compose poetry and music, and discuss affairs of state with the men who govern the Republic. When Veronica Franco comes of age, she cannot marry Marco Venier, whom she loves, because she is well born but penniless. Her choice: cloister or courtesan. She steels her heart, and with beauty and intelligence becomes the best. She's a heroine when she helps convince France to aid Venice in war with Turkey, but when plague descends, the Church charges her with witchcraft. At her inquisition, she must match wits with an old rival, speak for all women, and call courage from Venier.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films.

(For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners."

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive. I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted.

    When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original review This film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the time The film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example: a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence "perfecting her manners." Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments. The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would "dare" to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of "The Honest Courtesan" on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

    I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in "Braveheart". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film. McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly). Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian "bodice-ripper" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films. A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

    First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love. This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of "girl teen empowerment movie" in more than one scene. The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love. The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

    Film is great,but the most brilliant because of Catherine McCormack.Beautiful woman in here.If you want to see the portrait of what woman must be-you can see it in this film.Despite all the troubles and many forced lovers - she remains been in love with one man truly.Amazing dialogues all through the movie.I don't understand why this film so underrated,it's the most passionate film in this genre.And very truthful:for example,a moment when Maffio suggest's to Veronica spend night with him and she says - "No"...because the most wonderful women spend time with powerful men(laws of real life).Funny thing in the film- connection with "BraveHeart", noticed in inquisition line: the role of magistrate acted by one actor in both films.Great film,great times. 10 of 10.

    Dangerous Beauty, featuring Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell is an amazing rendition of the story of a famous 16th century Venetian courtesan and poet, Veronica Franco that is pulled from the book by Margaret Rosenthal, The Honest Courtesan.. It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted. Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition. While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened. Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.

    The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London. The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes. Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'. Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk

    Like most people, I too have top 5,10,20 movie lists and in all cases, the movies which made my lists I had the pleasure of seeing when they originally debuted. This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did. Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film. Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial. Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie. Like me, it will bring tears to your eyes and make you smile for days later.

    It is hard to find a movie that actually captures the soul of a time period. Often movies simply import a modern story into a different time period. In this case the story does reflect the complex morals and social situation of the historical time and place. I think it is a great movie to show in a History of the Renaissance class. It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen. The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting. The director and producers deserved academy award nominations. This ist rue movie-making magic, where you are transported to another time and place. I would recommend for anybody above the age of 13.

    In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church. "Dangerous Beauty" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Em Luta Pelo Amor" ("In Fight for Love")
