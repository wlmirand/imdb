    Master Chef Chu is a semi-retired Chinese chef at the Taipei Grand Hotel, and also has three daughters. The eldest Jia-Jen is a Chemistry teacher who has been converted to Christianity while nursing a broken heart from nine years ago during her college days, the middle one Jia-Chien is an airline executive who is a career woman at the same time, the youngest Jia-Ning is a student who works at a fast food restaurant. There is a tradition where every Sunday, Chu and his three daughters will gather round for an elaborate dinner with the dishes he has prepared. When the film begins, the three daughters encounter a new man in their respective work lives. There is also the arrival of their family friend Jin-Rong, her daughter Shan-Shan and her mother Madam Liang. Jin-Rong has returned back to Taipei after getting a divorce from her American husband in the United States. As the three daughters especially the middle one Jia-Chien trying to seek lives of their own, Chu found solace in his colleague and friend Old Wen with the latter trying to talk sense into Chu as the semi-retired chef began to lose his sense of taste of the food he has always cooked and the daughters who are seeking independent lives outside of the house they have always lived in, even after their mother had died 16 years prior to before the film begins. But as much as it is about Chu trying to come to terms with his daughters wanting to seek independent lives, it is also about the daughters trying to find their purpose in life especially for the eldest two. Then there is also the element of the mother of their family friend Madam Liang as she became shocked over what would become of her daughter. The film title may seem out of place, but it is actually a quote from one of the Confucian classics Book of Rites or Li Ji, when it is actually referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. As the film progresses, there is a sense that even Chu is trying to accept the fact that there will come a day his daughters will be leaving the house with their future respective husbands. Is seeking love as that straightforward as it is when it comes to everyone gathering round the table for a meal together? There is always something about food which brings people together, and it is the case when it comes to a family looking at life in a different way after reaching a certain stage in their respective lives. And it is the case in this heart-warming film as well.

    From the opening scene, I thought I was going to like this movie. The scene was artfully filmed and the music was great accompaniment. I did have some problems with the carp preparation and especially the chicken preparation. Those scenes were strong advocacy for vegetarianism. After the first scene, the movie started going wrong for me. There was too much emphasis on food preparation. I often had to ask myself if I was watching a movie, or the cooking channel. For example, the meal prepared in the first scene could easily have fed a dozen people and seemed out of proportion to the occasion. I saw two whole chickens, a half dozen frogs, crab dumplings, a whole fish, ham, vegetables, and more. After sitting through most of the movie going through the love affairs of the three daughters, which were quite unimaginative and hardly above the level of a TV sit-com, it finally looked like we might at least get a watered-down version of King Lear. The old man, alienated by the changes he saw in society, abandoned by his daughters, feeling inadequate to pursue his profession, was faced with a situation to challenge his character and courage. I was interested to see how he would handle it. But what did we get, a totally bogus marriage to a woman the age of his daughters followed by a pregnancy. What a cop-out. The ending rally irritated me--I felt totally taken advantage of. The message of the movie seems to be that food and sex are the only meaningful things in life. I agree that they fuel much of what goes on, but there are a lot more things to enjoy as well. I give it a star for being well filmed and edited, a star for the music, and a star for giving us a look at modern Taipei--which looks pretty much like the U.S.

    When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher in a high school and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)

    Film-maker Ang Lee scores a win with this film about a widower master chef and his three attractive 20-something daughters. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sensitive portrayal of emotional dynamics as the daughters wrestle with leaving the nest, whether physically or psychologically. In this somewhat stiff, formal family, people communicate - or fail to communicate - through food; and the viewer is treated to many sensuous culinary scenes. Yet as the movie progresses, we witness the characters' growing drive to verbalize what they mean and feel. The beauty of the daughters is depicted in a very restrained manner, so if you're looking for Chinese eroticism, best to look elsewhere. Give this fine movie a chance. "Eat Drink Man Woman" will have added appeal for most female viewers.

    Just want to say that I loved this movie! I loved the story! The direction of Ang Lee is amazing like it usually is! Being drawn into a group of people's lives and wanting to stay there with them is inspiring. The most compelling parts of the movie were the cooking scenes - oh my goodness what amazing cinematography with such beauty! Do not blink on any of them. If they had smellorama for the cooking scenes in this movie it would be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance ! I think they were the unexpected gems of the movie! You will enjoy the Tapei culture and learn the ways of the past and of the present. It will touch every angle of every emotion you have. Enjoy!

    Lee's 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' is one of the tastiest movies I've seen in recent times. Food is served as a metaphor here. Just the way you need the right ingredients to create a delicious dish, it's the same with life. Ingredients like friendship, love, food, sex and work are essential for life. However, merely knowing the ingredients isn't enough. It's the quality coupled with quantity that proves crucial. 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' tells the story of a father, Chu, who is a celebrated chef, and his three daughters Jen, Chen and Ning. All three daughters are in their twenties and they still live with their father. Even though each are adults and have their own job, Chu feels responsible for them. They in turn feel responsible for their father and this feeling of obligation stands as a barrier between in their career path and romantic relationships.The daughters clearly love their father but there is too much frustration for the family to be functional. Lee gives his film a one-of-a-kind touch. It's very poetic, metaphoric, poignant and funny. The story is very down to earth and the movie looks and feels authentic. The characters and their dilemma are very recognizable. Lee gives a glimpse of the depth of his insight into human nature. He is truly a unique (and versatile) filmmaker. The food in the film is exotic and you'll crave for some Chinese. Perhaps you can order or have some homemade Chinese dish while watching this delightful recipe of life. In addition, this might sound a little out of place but the cinematography is stupendous. Sihung Lung is spellbinding as the patriarch of the family and master chef who is looking for some peace of mind while burdened by the responsibility of taking care of his daughters. Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-lien Wu and Yu-Wen Wang are brilliant as the three daughters. The supporting cast is splendid. Overall, this is one delicious little film. Get ready for some Chinese while you experience this slice, no, recipe of life that Ang Lee involves you in. Yummy!

    I watched this film again recently on DVD, for the first time in years. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it. First and foremost, the filming of the cooking scenes are some of the most exquisitely shot scenes you will ever see. Ang Lee in this film reveals himself to be a master chef of cinema. The film's theme, having to do with the interaction of cooking with the unexpected ebb and flow of life and relationships, makes this a must-see film for me. I think I loved the continually surprising turning of events as much as anything and was as satisfied at the end as if I had just finished a multi-course meal, prepared, as I wrote, by a master chef. Nothing in this movie turns out as you expect it to. That is part of the film's genius. "Eat Drink, Man Woman" is a treat on so many levels. It is a film that celebrates all the flavors of life and family.

    This is one of those rare films that came along and knocked me on my ass because of simply how close it is to my heart. My father is a chef from Taiwan and owned his own restaurant so I grew up around the sights and sounds that you could see in the movie. Even though our family unit is nothing like Chu's in the movie I could identify very well with the humorous and fatalistic trials and tribulations of your typical Chinese household. Eat Drink Man Woman also captured the hectic life of Taiwan fairly well. Ang Lee proves again what a master he is at blending his skilled hand at film making with contemporary and ancient eastern traditions to come up with this warm-hearted spirited movie. This is simply put a movie about life and enjoying the simple pleasures of family, food, and friends while you can while overcoming a narrow outlook to see the bigger picture. The message is simple but it's the delivery of it that counts.

    This is the first movie Ang Lee made in Taiwan (his first two were made in the US, although they feature Chinese characters) and it is a very typical Ang Lee movie: heartwarming, concerned with human relationships. The rich and busy plot unfolds with verve and skill, but the director's interest is squarely on the relations between each of the main characters. The wonderful culinary skills on display may owe something to Ang Lee's years as a house-husband (You have been warned: don't watch this on an empty stomach!). Ang Lee once again shows he has sex very much at the back of his mind, in this, his third feature: he equates basic necessity of food and eating with the need for a spouse/partner and sex. There are actually three sisters who trying to get hitched as the movie starts: 1) The eldest is an introverted Protestant who is a schoolteacher, who nurses a broken heart due to a failed relationship back in college; 2) The second is a career woman, who has broken up with her beau but is still continuing a sexual relationship with him; 3) The third is a 20-year-old working at a fast-food joint The three are somewhat distanced from the widow father (Sihung Lung), who is a decorated, semi-retired Chinese master chef. Owing to the generational gap, they treat their Sunday reunion dinner with their father as a solemn ceremonious chore rather than a joyous gathering. Furthermore, it is revealed that the chef father is gradually losing his sense of taste, affecting to a large extent the dishes he is cooking. From this premise Ang Lee and his scriptwriters pull all stops to open a Pandora box replete with humor, twists in familial/boy-girl relationships and even a couple of narrative surprises. The 2-hour running time passes by in a breeze and the story is bittersweet, frequently very funny and yet immensely affecting and entertaining. My only gripe is that the final "twist" in the tale is a little too much to take, but everything else about this movie is exemplary. If you get to see a foreign movie like this you should regard it as a treat, both visually, gastronomically and cinematically. Feast on it!

    With one possible exception (and you know well what that is),Ang Lee has certainly crafted his lion's share of fine film fare over the years. From 'The Wedding Feast',through 'Brokeback Mountain',he has put his blood,sweat & tears into each of his films. 'Eat,Drink,Man,Woman' is another shining example. Tao Chu (played by Sihung Lung)is a semi retired chef that has worked at a posh Taipei restaurant for most of his life,is a widower with three adult daughters,who has lost most of his sense of taste (to the extent that his second in command is expected to taste each & every dish). Dao's three daughters are strong,independent women,who seem to have really,really bad luck with their choices in men. In addition,Dao oversees a young, newly divorced mother with an overbearing mother who every body loves to hate. What I admired about this film was the individual stories about the three daughters (kind of like what Wayne Wang did with his version of 'The Joy Luck Club'),and of course,all of that food being prepared & enjoyed on screen (another film to undertake after enjoying a full meal,as you'll be roaring hungry afterward). The film benefits from a well written screenplay (written by Ang Lee, with his frequent collaborator,James Schamus & Hui-Ling Wang),and some sumptuous photography that makes the proceedings look really good on film). Worth seeking out either on DVD,or even better (if there's a revival)on screen. Spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles. Rated PG,by the MPAA for a bit of rough language,and some adult situations

The wonderful culinary skills on display may owe something to Ang Lee's years as a house-husband (You have been warned: don't watch this on an empty stomach!). Ang Lee once again shows he has sex very much at the back of his mind, in this, his third feature: he equates basic necessity of food and eating with the need for a spouse/partner and sex. There are actually three sisters who trying to get hitched as the movie starts: 1) The eldest is an introverted Protestant who is a schoolteacher, who nurses a broken heart due to a failed relationship back in college; 2) The second is a career woman, who has broken up with her beau but is still continuing a sexual relationship with him; 3) The third is a 20-year-old working at a fast-food joint The three are somewhat distanced from the widow father (Sihung Lung), who is a decorated, semi-retired Chinese master chef. Owing to the generational gap, they treat their Sunday reunion dinner with their father as a solemn ceremonious chore rather than a joyous gathering. Furthermore, it is revealed that the chef father is gradually losing his sense of taste, affecting to a large extent the dishes he is cooking. From this premise Ang Lee and his scriptwriters pull all stops to open a Pandora box replete with humor, twists in familial/boy-girl relationships and even a couple of narrative surprises. The 2-hour running time passes by in a breeze and the story is bittersweet, frequently very funny and yet immensely affecting and entertaining. My only gripe is that the final "twist" in the tale is a little too much to take, but everything else about this movie is exemplary. If you get to see a foreign movie like this you should regard it as a treat, both visually, gastronomically and cinematically. Feast on it!

    With one possible exception (and you know well what that is),Ang Lee has certainly crafted his lion's share of fine film fare over the years. From 'The Wedding Feast',through 'Brokeback Mountain',he has put his blood,sweat & tears into each of his films. 'Eat,Drink,Man,Woman' is another shining example. Tao Chu (played by Sihung Lung)is a semi retired chef that has worked at a posh Taipei restaurant for most of his life,is a widower with three adult daughters,who has lost most of his sense of taste (to the extent that his second in command is expected to taste each & every dish). Dao's three daughters are strong,independent women,who seem to have really,really bad luck with their choices in men. In addition,Dao oversees a young, newly divorced mother with an overbearing mother who every body loves to hate. What I admired about this film was the individual stories about the three daughters (kind of like what Wayne Wang did with his version of 'The Joy Luck Club'),and of course,all of that food being prepared & enjoyed on screen (another film to undertake after enjoying a full meal,as you'll be roaring hungry afterward). The film benefits from a well written screenplay (written by Ang Lee, with his frequent collaborator,James Schamus & Hui-Ling Wang),and some sumptuous photography that makes the proceedings look really good on film). Worth seeking out either on DVD,or even better (if there's a revival)on screen. Spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles. Rated PG,by the MPAA for a bit of rough language,and some adult situations

    Master Chef Chu is a semi-retired Chinese chef at the Taipei Grand Hotel, and also has three daughters. The eldest Jia-Jen is a Chemistry teacher who has been converted to Christianity while nursing a broken heart from nine years ago during her college days, the middle one Jia-Chien is an airline executive who is a career woman at the same time, the youngest Jia-Ning is a student who works at a fast food restaurant. There is a tradition where every Sunday, Chu and his three daughters will gather round for an elaborate dinner with the dishes he has prepared. When the film begins, the three daughters encounter a new man in their respective work lives. There is also the arrival of their family friend Jin-Rong, her daughter Shan-Shan and her mother Madam Liang. Jin-Rong has returned back to Taipei after getting a divorce from her American husband in the United States. As the three daughters especially the middle one Jia-Chien trying to seek lives of their own, Chu found solace in his colleague and friend Old Wen with the latter trying to talk sense into Chu as the semi-retired chef began to lose his sense of taste of the food he has always cooked and the daughters who are seeking independent lives outside of the house they have always lived in, even after their mother had died 16 years prior to before the film begins. But as much as it is about Chu trying to come to terms with his daughters wanting to seek independent lives, it is also about the daughters trying to find their purpose in life especially for the eldest two. Then there is also the element of the mother of their family friend Madam Liang as she became shocked over what would become of her daughter. The film title may seem out of place, but it is actually a quote from one of the Confucian classics Book of Rites or Li Ji, when it is actually referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. As the film progresses, there is a sense that even Chu is trying to accept the fact that there will come a day his daughters will be leaving the house with their future respective husbands. Is seeking love as that straightforward as it is when it comes to everyone gathering round the table for a meal together? There is always something about food which brings people together, and it is the case when it comes to a family looking at life in a different way after reaching a certain stage in their respective lives. And it is the case in this heart-warming film as well.

    From the opening scene, I thought I was going to like this movie. The scene was artfully filmed and the music was great accompaniment. I did have some problems with the carp preparation and especially the chicken preparation. Those scenes were strong advocacy for vegetarianism. After the first scene, the movie started going wrong for me. There was too much emphasis on food preparation. I often had to ask myself if I was watching a movie, or the cooking channel. For example, the meal prepared in the first scene could easily have fed a dozen people and seemed out of proportion to the occasion. I saw two whole chickens, a half dozen frogs, crab dumplings, a whole fish, ham, vegetables, and more. After sitting through most of the movie going through the love affairs of the three daughters, which were quite unimaginative and hardly above the level of a TV sit-com, it finally looked like we might at least get a watered-down version of King Lear. The old man, alienated by the changes he saw in society, abandoned by his daughters, feeling inadequate to pursue his profession, was faced with a situation to challenge his character and courage. I was interested to see how he would handle it. But what did we get, a totally bogus marriage to a woman the age of his daughters followed by a pregnancy. What a cop-out. The ending rally irritated me--I felt totally taken advantage of. The message of the movie seems to be that food and sex are the only meaningful things in life. I agree that they fuel much of what goes on, but there are a lot more things to enjoy as well. I give it a star for being well filmed and edited, a star for the music, and a star for giving us a look at modern Taipei--which looks pretty much like the U.S.

    When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher in a high school and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)

    Film-maker Ang Lee scores a win with this film about a widower master chef and his three attractive 20-something daughters. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sensitive portrayal of emotional dynamics as the daughters wrestle with leaving the nest, whether physically or psychologically. In this somewhat stiff, formal family, people communicate - or fail to communicate - through food; and the viewer is treated to many sensuous culinary scenes. Yet as the movie progresses, we witness the characters' growing drive to verbalize what they mean and feel. The beauty of the daughters is depicted in a very restrained manner, so if you're looking for Chinese eroticism, best to look elsewhere. Give this fine movie a chance. "Eat Drink Man Woman" will have added appeal for most female viewers.

Being drawn into a group of people's lives and wanting to stay there with them is inspiring. The most compelling parts of the movie were the cooking scenes - oh my goodness what amazing cinematography with such beauty! Do not blink on any of them. If they had smellorama for the cooking scenes in this movie it would be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance ! I think they were the unexpected gems of the movie! You will enjoy the Tapei culture and learn the ways of the past and of the present. It will touch every angle of every emotion you have. Enjoy!

    Lee's 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' is one of the tastiest movies I've seen in recent times. Food is served as a metaphor here. Just the way you need the right ingredients to create a delicious dish, it's the same with life. Ingredients like friendship, love, food, sex and work are essential for life. However, merely knowing the ingredients isn't enough. It's the quality coupled with quantity that proves crucial. 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' tells the story of a father, Chu, who is a celebrated chef, and his three daughters Jen, Chen and Ning. All three daughters are in their twenties and they still live with their father. Even though each are adults and have their own job, Chu feels responsible for them. They in turn feel responsible for their father and this feeling of obligation stands as a barrier between in their career path and romantic relationships.The daughters clearly love their father but there is too much frustration for the family to be functional. Lee gives his film a one-of-a-kind touch. It's very poetic, metaphoric, poignant and funny. The story is very down to earth and the movie looks and feels authentic. The characters and their dilemma are very recognizable. Lee gives a glimpse of the depth of his insight into human nature. He is truly a unique (and versatile) filmmaker. The food in the film is exotic and you'll crave for some Chinese. Perhaps you can order or have some homemade Chinese dish while watching this delightful recipe of life. In addition, this might sound a little out of place but the cinematography is stupendous. Sihung Lung is spellbinding as the patriarch of the family and master chef who is looking for some peace of mind while burdened by the responsibility of taking care of his daughters. Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-lien Wu and Yu-Wen Wang are brilliant as the three daughters. The supporting cast is splendid. Overall, this is one delicious little film. Get ready for some Chinese while you experience this slice, no, recipe of life that Ang Lee involves you in. Yummy!

    I watched this film again recently on DVD, for the first time in years. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it. First and foremost, the filming of the cooking scenes are some of the most exquisitely shot scenes you will ever see. Ang Lee in this film reveals himself to be a master chef of cinema. The film's theme, having to do with the interaction of cooking with the unexpected ebb and flow of life and relationships, makes this a must-see film for me. I think I loved the continually surprising turning of events as much as anything and was as satisfied at the end as if I had just finished a multi-course meal, prepared, as I wrote, by a master chef. Nothing in this movie turns out as you expect it to. That is part of the film's genius. "Eat Drink, Man Woman" is a treat on so many levels. It is a film that celebrates all the flavors of life and family.

    This is one of those rare films that came along and knocked me on my ass because of simply how close it is to my heart. My father is a chef from Taiwan and owned his own restaurant so I grew up around the sights and sounds that you could see in the movie. Even though our family unit is nothing like Chu's in the movie I could identify very well with the humorous and fatalistic trials and tribulations of your typical Chinese household. Eat Drink Man Woman also captured the hectic life of Taiwan fairly well. Ang Lee proves again what a master he is at blending his skilled hand at film making with contemporary and ancient eastern traditions to come up with this warm-hearted spirited movie. This is simply put a movie about life and enjoying the simple pleasures of family, food, and friends while you can while overcoming a narrow outlook to see the bigger picture. The message is simple but it's the delivery of it that counts.

Ang Lee once again shows he has sex very much at the back of his mind, in this, his third feature: he equates basic necessity of food and eating with the need for a spouse/partner and sex. There are actually three sisters who trying to get hitched as the movie starts: 1) The eldest is an introverted Protestant who is a schoolteacher, who nurses a broken heart due to a failed relationship back in college; 2) The second is a career woman, who has broken up with her beau but is still continuing a sexual relationship with him; 3) The third is a 20-year-old working at a fast-food joint The three are somewhat distanced from the widow father (Sihung Lung), who is a decorated, semi-retired Chinese master chef. Owing to the generational gap, they treat their Sunday reunion dinner with their father as a solemn ceremonious chore rather than a joyous gathering. Furthermore, it is revealed that the chef father is gradually losing his sense of taste, affecting to a large extent the dishes he is cooking. From this premise Ang Lee and his scriptwriters pull all stops to open a Pandora box replete with humor, twists in familial/boy-girl relationships and even a couple of narrative surprises. The 2-hour running time passes by in a breeze and the story is bittersweet, frequently very funny and yet immensely affecting and entertaining. My only gripe is that the final "twist" in the tale is a little too much to take, but everything else about this movie is exemplary. If you get to see a foreign movie like this you should regard it as a treat, both visually, gastronomically and cinematically. Feast on it!

    This is one of those rare films that came along and knocked me on my ass because of simply how close it is to my heart. My father is a chef from Taiwan and owned his own restaurant so I grew up around the sights and sounds that you could see in the movie. Even though our family unit is nothing like Chu's in the movie I could identify very well with the humorous and fatalistic trials and tribulations of your typical Chinese household. Eat Drink Man Woman also captured the hectic life of Taiwan fairly well. Ang Lee proves again what a master he is at blending his skilled hand at film making with contemporary and ancient eastern traditions to come up with this warm-hearted spirited movie. This is simply put a movie about life and enjoying the simple pleasures of family, food, and friends while you can while overcoming a narrow outlook to see the bigger picture. The message is simple but it's the delivery of it that counts.

    This is the first movie Ang Lee made in Taiwan (his first two were made in the US, although they feature Chinese characters) and it is a very typical Ang Lee movie: heartwarming, concerned with human relationships. The rich and busy plot unfolds with verve and skill, but the director's interest is squarely on the relations between each of the main characters. The wonderful culinary skills on display may owe something to Ang Lee's years as a house-husband (You have been warned: don't watch this on an empty stomach!). Ang Lee once again shows he has sex very much at the back of his mind, in this, his third feature: he equates basic necessity of food and eating with the need for a spouse/partner and sex. There are actually three sisters who trying to get hitched as the movie starts: 1) The eldest is an introverted Protestant who is a schoolteacher, who nurses a broken heart due to a failed relationship back in college; 2) The second is a career woman, who has broken up with her beau but is still continuing a sexual relationship with him; 3) The third is a 20-year-old working at a fast-food joint The three are somewhat distanced from the widow father (Sihung Lung), who is a decorated, semi-retired Chinese master chef. Owing to the generational gap, they treat their Sunday reunion dinner with their father as a solemn ceremonious chore rather than a joyous gathering. Furthermore, it is revealed that the chef father is gradually losing his sense of taste, affecting to a large extent the dishes he is cooking. From this premise Ang Lee and his scriptwriters pull all stops to open a Pandora box replete with humor, twists in familial/boy-girl relationships and even a couple of narrative surprises. The 2-hour running time passes by in a breeze and the story is bittersweet, frequently very funny and yet immensely affecting and entertaining. My only gripe is that the final "twist" in the tale is a little too much to take, but everything else about this movie is exemplary. If you get to see a foreign movie like this you should regard it as a treat, both visually, gastronomically and cinematically. Feast on it!

    With one possible exception (and you know well what that is),Ang Lee has certainly crafted his lion's share of fine film fare over the years. From 'The Wedding Feast',through 'Brokeback Mountain',he has put his blood,sweat & tears into each of his films. 'Eat,Drink,Man,Woman' is another shining example. Tao Chu (played by Sihung Lung)is a semi retired chef that has worked at a posh Taipei restaurant for most of his life,is a widower with three adult daughters,who has lost most of his sense of taste (to the extent that his second in command is expected to taste each & every dish). Dao's three daughters are strong,independent women,who seem to have really,really bad luck with their choices in men. In addition,Dao oversees a young, newly divorced mother with an overbearing mother who every body loves to hate. What I admired about this film was the individual stories about the three daughters (kind of like what Wayne Wang did with his version of 'The Joy Luck Club'),and of course,all of that food being prepared & enjoyed on screen (another film to undertake after enjoying a full meal,as you'll be roaring hungry afterward). The film benefits from a well written screenplay (written by Ang Lee, with his frequent collaborator,James Schamus & Hui-Ling Wang),and some sumptuous photography that makes the proceedings look really good on film). Worth seeking out either on DVD,or even better (if there's a revival)on screen. Spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles. Rated PG,by the MPAA for a bit of rough language,and some adult situations

    Master Chef Chu is a semi-retired Chinese chef at the Taipei Grand Hotel, and also has three daughters. The eldest Jia-Jen is a Chemistry teacher who has been converted to Christianity while nursing a broken heart from nine years ago during her college days, the middle one Jia-Chien is an airline executive who is a career woman at the same time, the youngest Jia-Ning is a student who works at a fast food restaurant. There is a tradition where every Sunday, Chu and his three daughters will gather round for an elaborate dinner with the dishes he has prepared. When the film begins, the three daughters encounter a new man in their respective work lives. There is also the arrival of their family friend Jin-Rong, her daughter Shan-Shan and her mother Madam Liang. Jin-Rong has returned back to Taipei after getting a divorce from her American husband in the United States. As the three daughters especially the middle one Jia-Chien trying to seek lives of their own, Chu found solace in his colleague and friend Old Wen with the latter trying to talk sense into Chu as the semi-retired chef began to lose his sense of taste of the food he has always cooked and the daughters who are seeking independent lives outside of the house they have always lived in, even after their mother had died 16 years prior to before the film begins. But as much as it is about Chu trying to come to terms with his daughters wanting to seek independent lives, it is also about the daughters trying to find their purpose in life especially for the eldest two. Then there is also the element of the mother of their family friend Madam Liang as she became shocked over what would become of her daughter. The film title may seem out of place, but it is actually a quote from one of the Confucian classics Book of Rites or Li Ji, when it is actually referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. As the film progresses, there is a sense that even Chu is trying to accept the fact that there will come a day his daughters will be leaving the house with their future respective husbands. Is seeking love as that straightforward as it is when it comes to everyone gathering round the table for a meal together? There is always something about food which brings people together, and it is the case when it comes to a family looking at life in a different way after reaching a certain stage in their respective lives. And it is the case in this heart-warming film as well.

    From the opening scene, I thought I was going to like this movie. The scene was artfully filmed and the music was great accompaniment. I did have some problems with the carp preparation and especially the chicken preparation. Those scenes were strong advocacy for vegetarianism. After the first scene, the movie started going wrong for me. There was too much emphasis on food preparation. I often had to ask myself if I was watching a movie, or the cooking channel. For example, the meal prepared in the first scene could easily have fed a dozen people and seemed out of proportion to the occasion. I saw two whole chickens, a half dozen frogs, crab dumplings, a whole fish, ham, vegetables, and more. After sitting through most of the movie going through the love affairs of the three daughters, which were quite unimaginative and hardly above the level of a TV sit-com, it finally looked like we might at least get a watered-down version of King Lear. The old man, alienated by the changes he saw in society, abandoned by his daughters, feeling inadequate to pursue his profession, was faced with a situation to challenge his character and courage. I was interested to see how he would handle it. But what did we get, a totally bogus marriage to a woman the age of his daughters followed by a pregnancy. What a cop-out. The ending rally irritated me--I felt totally taken advantage of. The message of the movie seems to be that food and sex are the only meaningful things in life. I agree that they fuel much of what goes on, but there are a lot more things to enjoy as well. I give it a star for being well filmed and edited, a star for the music, and a star for giving us a look at modern Taipei--which looks pretty much like the U.S.

    When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher in a high school and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)

    Film-maker Ang Lee scores a win with this film about a widower master chef and his three attractive 20-something daughters. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sensitive portrayal of emotional dynamics as the daughters wrestle with leaving the nest, whether physically or psychologically. In this somewhat stiff, formal family, people communicate - or fail to communicate - through food; and the viewer is treated to many sensuous culinary scenes. Yet as the movie progresses, we witness the characters' growing drive to verbalize what they mean and feel. The beauty of the daughters is depicted in a very restrained manner, so if you're looking for Chinese eroticism, best to look elsewhere. Give this fine movie a chance. "Eat Drink Man Woman" will have added appeal for most female viewers.

Being drawn into a group of people's lives and wanting to stay there with them is inspiring. The most compelling parts of the movie were the cooking scenes - oh my goodness what amazing cinematography with such beauty! Do not blink on any of them. If they had smellorama for the cooking scenes in this movie it would be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance ! I think they were the unexpected gems of the movie! You will enjoy the Tapei culture and learn the ways of the past and of the present. It will touch every angle of every emotion you have. Enjoy!

    Lee's 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' is one of the tastiest movies I've seen in recent times. Food is served as a metaphor here. Just the way you need the right ingredients to create a delicious dish, it's the same with life. Ingredients like friendship, love, food, sex and work are essential for life. However, merely knowing the ingredients isn't enough. It's the quality coupled with quantity that proves crucial. 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' tells the story of a father, Chu, who is a celebrated chef, and his three daughters Jen, Chen and Ning. All three daughters are in their twenties and they still live with their father. Even though each are adults and have their own job, Chu feels responsible for them. They in turn feel responsible for their father and this feeling of obligation stands as a barrier between in their career path and romantic relationships.The daughters clearly love their father but there is too much frustration for the family to be functional. Lee gives his film a one-of-a-kind touch. It's very poetic, metaphoric, poignant and funny. The story is very down to earth and the movie looks and feels authentic. The characters and their dilemma are very recognizable. Lee gives a glimpse of the depth of his insight into human nature. He is truly a unique (and versatile) filmmaker. The food in the film is exotic and you'll crave for some Chinese. Perhaps you can order or have some homemade Chinese dish while watching this delightful recipe of life. In addition, this might sound a little out of place but the cinematography is stupendous. Sihung Lung is spellbinding as the patriarch of the family and master chef who is looking for some peace of mind while burdened by the responsibility of taking care of his daughters. Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-lien Wu and Yu-Wen Wang are brilliant as the three daughters. The supporting cast is splendid. Overall, this is one delicious little film. Get ready for some Chinese while you experience this slice, no, recipe of life that Ang Lee involves you in. Yummy!

    I watched this film again recently on DVD, for the first time in years. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it. First and foremost, the filming of the cooking scenes are some of the most exquisitely shot scenes you will ever see. Ang Lee in this film reveals himself to be a master chef of cinema. The film's theme, having to do with the interaction of cooking with the unexpected ebb and flow of life and relationships, makes this a must-see film for me. I think I loved the continually surprising turning of events as much as anything and was as satisfied at the end as if I had just finished a multi-course meal, prepared, as I wrote, by a master chef. Nothing in this movie turns out as you expect it to. That is part of the film's genius. "Eat Drink, Man Woman" is a treat on so many levels. It is a film that celebrates all the flavors of life and family.

    I watched this film again recently on DVD, for the first time in years. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it. First and foremost, the filming of the cooking scenes are some of the most exquisitely shot scenes you will ever see. Ang Lee in this film reveals himself to be a master chef of cinema. The film's theme, having to do with the interaction of cooking with the unexpected ebb and flow of life and relationships, makes this a must-see film for me. I think I loved the continually surprising turning of events as much as anything and was as satisfied at the end as if I had just finished a multi-course meal, prepared, as I wrote, by a master chef. Nothing in this movie turns out as you expect it to. That is part of the film's genius. "Eat Drink, Man Woman" is a treat on so many levels. It is a film that celebrates all the flavors of life and family.

    This is one of those rare films that came along and knocked me on my ass because of simply how close it is to my heart. My father is a chef from Taiwan and owned his own restaurant so I grew up around the sights and sounds that you could see in the movie. Even though our family unit is nothing like Chu's in the movie I could identify very well with the humorous and fatalistic trials and tribulations of your typical Chinese household. Eat Drink Man Woman also captured the hectic life of Taiwan fairly well. Ang Lee proves again what a master he is at blending his skilled hand at film making with contemporary and ancient eastern traditions to come up with this warm-hearted spirited movie. This is simply put a movie about life and enjoying the simple pleasures of family, food, and friends while you can while overcoming a narrow outlook to see the bigger picture. The message is simple but it's the delivery of it that counts.

    This is the first movie Ang Lee made in Taiwan (his first two were made in the US, although they feature Chinese characters) and it is a very typical Ang Lee movie: heartwarming, concerned with human relationships. The rich and busy plot unfolds with verve and skill, but the director's interest is squarely on the relations between each of the main characters. The wonderful culinary skills on display may owe something to Ang Lee's years as a house-husband (You have been warned: don't watch this on an empty stomach!). Ang Lee once again shows he has sex very much at the back of his mind, in this, his third feature: he equates basic necessity of food and eating with the need for a spouse/partner and sex. There are actually three sisters who trying to get hitched as the movie starts: 1) The eldest is an introverted Protestant who is a schoolteacher, who nurses a broken heart due to a failed relationship back in college; 2) The second is a career woman, who has broken up with her beau but is still continuing a sexual relationship with him; 3) The third is a 20-year-old working at a fast-food joint The three are somewhat distanced from the widow father (Sihung Lung), who is a decorated, semi-retired Chinese master chef. Owing to the generational gap, they treat their Sunday reunion dinner with their father as a solemn ceremonious chore rather than a joyous gathering. Furthermore, it is revealed that the chef father is gradually losing his sense of taste, affecting to a large extent the dishes he is cooking. From this premise Ang Lee and his scriptwriters pull all stops to open a Pandora box replete with humor, twists in familial/boy-girl relationships and even a couple of narrative surprises. The 2-hour running time passes by in a breeze and the story is bittersweet, frequently very funny and yet immensely affecting and entertaining. My only gripe is that the final "twist" in the tale is a little too much to take, but everything else about this movie is exemplary. If you get to see a foreign movie like this you should regard it as a treat, both visually, gastronomically and cinematically. Feast on it!

    With one possible exception (and you know well what that is),Ang Lee has certainly crafted his lion's share of fine film fare over the years. From 'The Wedding Feast',through 'Brokeback Mountain',he has put his blood,sweat & tears into each of his films. 'Eat,Drink,Man,Woman' is another shining example. Tao Chu (played by Sihung Lung)is a semi retired chef that has worked at a posh Taipei restaurant for most of his life,is a widower with three adult daughters,who has lost most of his sense of taste (to the extent that his second in command is expected to taste each & every dish). Dao's three daughters are strong,independent women,who seem to have really,really bad luck with their choices in men. In addition,Dao oversees a young, newly divorced mother with an overbearing mother who every body loves to hate. What I admired about this film was the individual stories about the three daughters (kind of like what Wayne Wang did with his version of 'The Joy Luck Club'),and of course,all of that food being prepared & enjoyed on screen (another film to undertake after enjoying a full meal,as you'll be roaring hungry afterward). The film benefits from a well written screenplay (written by Ang Lee, with his frequent collaborator,James Schamus & Hui-Ling Wang),and some sumptuous photography that makes the proceedings look really good on film). Worth seeking out either on DVD,or even better (if there's a revival)on screen. Spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles. Rated PG,by the MPAA for a bit of rough language,and some adult situations

    Master Chef Chu is a semi-retired Chinese chef at the Taipei Grand Hotel, and also has three daughters. The eldest Jia-Jen is a Chemistry teacher who has been converted to Christianity while nursing a broken heart from nine years ago during her college days, the middle one Jia-Chien is an airline executive who is a career woman at the same time, the youngest Jia-Ning is a student who works at a fast food restaurant. There is a tradition where every Sunday, Chu and his three daughters will gather round for an elaborate dinner with the dishes he has prepared. When the film begins, the three daughters encounter a new man in their respective work lives. There is also the arrival of their family friend Jin-Rong, her daughter Shan-Shan and her mother Madam Liang. Jin-Rong has returned back to Taipei after getting a divorce from her American husband in the United States. As the three daughters especially the middle one Jia-Chien trying to seek lives of their own, Chu found solace in his colleague and friend Old Wen with the latter trying to talk sense into Chu as the semi-retired chef began to lose his sense of taste of the food he has always cooked and the daughters who are seeking independent lives outside of the house they have always lived in, even after their mother had died 16 years prior to before the film begins. But as much as it is about Chu trying to come to terms with his daughters wanting to seek independent lives, it is also about the daughters trying to find their purpose in life especially for the eldest two. Then there is also the element of the mother of their family friend Madam Liang as she became shocked over what would become of her daughter. The film title may seem out of place, but it is actually a quote from one of the Confucian classics Book of Rites or Li Ji, when it is actually referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. As the film progresses, there is a sense that even Chu is trying to accept the fact that there will come a day his daughters will be leaving the house with their future respective husbands. Is seeking love as that straightforward as it is when it comes to everyone gathering round the table for a meal together? There is always something about food which brings people together, and it is the case when it comes to a family looking at life in a different way after reaching a certain stage in their respective lives. And it is the case in this heart-warming film as well.

    From the opening scene, I thought I was going to like this movie. The scene was artfully filmed and the music was great accompaniment. I did have some problems with the carp preparation and especially the chicken preparation. Those scenes were strong advocacy for vegetarianism. After the first scene, the movie started going wrong for me. There was too much emphasis on food preparation. I often had to ask myself if I was watching a movie, or the cooking channel. For example, the meal prepared in the first scene could easily have fed a dozen people and seemed out of proportion to the occasion. I saw two whole chickens, a half dozen frogs, crab dumplings, a whole fish, ham, vegetables, and more. After sitting through most of the movie going through the love affairs of the three daughters, which were quite unimaginative and hardly above the level of a TV sit-com, it finally looked like we might at least get a watered-down version of King Lear. The old man, alienated by the changes he saw in society, abandoned by his daughters, feeling inadequate to pursue his profession, was faced with a situation to challenge his character and courage. I was interested to see how he would handle it. But what did we get, a totally bogus marriage to a woman the age of his daughters followed by a pregnancy. What a cop-out. The ending rally irritated me--I felt totally taken advantage of. The message of the movie seems to be that food and sex are the only meaningful things in life. I agree that they fuel much of what goes on, but there are a lot more things to enjoy as well. I give it a star for being well filmed and edited, a star for the music, and a star for giving us a look at modern Taipei--which looks pretty much like the U.S.

    When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher in a high school and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)

    Film-maker Ang Lee scores a win with this film about a widower master chef and his three attractive 20-something daughters. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sensitive portrayal of emotional dynamics as the daughters wrestle with leaving the nest, whether physically or psychologically. In this somewhat stiff, formal family, people communicate - or fail to communicate - through food; and the viewer is treated to many sensuous culinary scenes. Yet as the movie progresses, we witness the characters' growing drive to verbalize what they mean and feel. The beauty of the daughters is depicted in a very restrained manner, so if you're looking for Chinese eroticism, best to look elsewhere. Give this fine movie a chance. "Eat Drink Man Woman" will have added appeal for most female viewers.

    Just want to say that I loved this movie! I loved the story! The direction of Ang Lee is amazing like it usually is! Being drawn into a group of people's lives and wanting to stay there with them is inspiring. The most compelling parts of the movie were the cooking scenes - oh my goodness what amazing cinematography with such beauty! Do not blink on any of them. If they had smellorama for the cooking scenes in this movie it would be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance ! I think they were the unexpected gems of the movie! You will enjoy the Tapei culture and learn the ways of the past and of the present. It will touch every angle of every emotion you have. Enjoy!

    Lee's 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' is one of the tastiest movies I've seen in recent times. Food is served as a metaphor here. Just the way you need the right ingredients to create a delicious dish, it's the same with life. Ingredients like friendship, love, food, sex and work are essential for life. However, merely knowing the ingredients isn't enough. It's the quality coupled with quantity that proves crucial. 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' tells the story of a father, Chu, who is a celebrated chef, and his three daughters Jen, Chen and Ning. All three daughters are in their twenties and they still live with their father. Even though each are adults and have their own job, Chu feels responsible for them. They in turn feel responsible for their father and this feeling of obligation stands as a barrier between in their career path and romantic relationships.The daughters clearly love their father but there is too much frustration for the family to be functional. Lee gives his film a one-of-a-kind touch. It's very poetic, metaphoric, poignant and funny. The story is very down to earth and the movie looks and feels authentic. The characters and their dilemma are very recognizable. Lee gives a glimpse of the depth of his insight into human nature. He is truly a unique (and versatile) filmmaker. The food in the film is exotic and you'll crave for some Chinese. Perhaps you can order or have some homemade Chinese dish while watching this delightful recipe of life. In addition, this might sound a little out of place but the cinematography is stupendous. Sihung Lung is spellbinding as the patriarch of the family and master chef who is looking for some peace of mind while burdened by the responsibility of taking care of his daughters. Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-lien Wu and Yu-Wen Wang are brilliant as the three daughters. The supporting cast is splendid. Overall, this is one delicious little film. Get ready for some Chinese while you experience this slice, no, recipe of life that Ang Lee involves you in. Yummy!
