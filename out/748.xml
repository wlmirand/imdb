    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

    This movie was horrendous. The plot was pathetic and non-original and the acting was painful to watch. As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said.

Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

    This movie was horrendous. The plot was pathetic and non-original and the acting was painful to watch. As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

    This movie was horrendous. The plot was pathetic and non-original and the acting was painful to watch. As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

    This movie was horrendous. The plot was pathetic and non-original and the acting was painful to watch. As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.

    The Saint is a fun, well paced jaunt into the world of Simon Templar. Simon Templar can be looked at as a rogue mercenary who does dangerous and technically advanced jobs that only a handful of people in the world can pull off. It features solid acting from its three main characters (Val Kilmer in the title role, with Elisabeth Shue and Rade erbedija) and is never boring to watch. You can almost look at it as a precursor to the Jason Bourne style movies. While you cannot directly compare the plots of the two movies, after watching both you can see how the Bourne series adopts some of the action, intensity and overall feel of a movie like The Saint. I won't give away any more details, but it is worth watching and easily rates above its average score of 6 as seen on this website. It is a solid 7.5.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage.

    The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in "The Saint" are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable "Ghost and the Darkness" and the lukewarm "Island of Dr. Moreau," steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, "The Saint" sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks. "The Saint" is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of "Manifesto"), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of "The Ice Runner"). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of "Adventures in Babysitting") has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma. Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger." "Die Hard with a Vengeance" scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted "The Saint" with "Cape Fear" writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with "Meet the Tiger" (1928) and ending with "Salvage for the Saint" (1983). When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, "The Saint" is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While "The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. "The Saint" amounts to a one-man "Mission Impossible" with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and "The Saint" makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist. The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. "The Saint" asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked. As heroes go, "The Saint" isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, "The Saint" does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one "Saint" for a more venerable "Saint," the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, "The Saint" is worth a peek.

    "You know, wearing that black suit and waving a big Japanese sword around does not make you the Saint." "Just play your part." Henry mumbled through the face cover waving his Katana around. He knew it was a Katana because he knew that kind of thing from the comics. Unlike Kristl who was illiterate because she had never read comics as far as he knew. "And what part was that again?" "You are the Russian lesbian who just caught me red handed while stealing a formula from your masters safe. It is the one that changes water into vodka. Just say something with that foreign accent of yours." "I don't play Russians very well. I am Austrian, that makes it a German accent, not a Russian one. And what is with the lesbian stuff all the time?" Kristl remarked. "Well, your hair practically shouts lesbian." Henry said. "What is with the hair? Why does it make me look lesbian?" "It is shaved but for long hair on top and you painted it black and white, that hairstyle went out of fashion two decades ago. Only women pretending to be men would want to look like that." Henry said. "I hate you!" Krisl fumed. "Good, you can play the bad ass Russian better." Henry smiled and crouched in a fighting stance. Kristl face palmed and then said,"You are Simon Templar. An English gentleman thief. He never uses swords like that! Perhaps a saber or a cane, but not a weapon like that. Something stylish and English. You know: Roger Moore? Gentleman, under cooled humor, stiff upper lip, Rolls Royce.?" "Yeah, yeah. Get on with it." "Oh god, you just don't look at all like him, nor speak like him, nor have the same humor, nor have the style. You are so not Simon Templar." Kristl groaned, "Just like Val Kilmer?" Henry said. "Yeah, just like him." Kristl. "Well, it would have not mattered to me, but it's not even an exciting movie." Henry put down the sword and removed his mask to reveal a grin."The action sequences are plain boring. People shooting at him seem to miss even at point blank." "It's pretty bad on any level." Kristl,"The whole romantic bit is so cringe worthy. And how the Russians are portrayed like a bunch of money grabbers. It was probably meant to be funny." "You know that they considered having Kurt Russell play James Bond at the time?" "Oh? You mean Kurt -Snake Plissken- Russell? " Said Kristl."The grumpy anti hero from Escape From New York?" Kristl considered that for a minute. "It is a joke." Henry laughed. "He would have made a better Bond that Kilmer makes a Saint" Kristl said. "It wasn't Kurt Russell they considered, it was Mel Gibson."

    I enjoyed watching this movie from beginning to end. Val Kilmer portrayed his role very well. Elisabeth Shue is very beautiful. She also played her character very well. The acting is superb and the scenes are top notch. Most negative comments are from people who compared this movie to the original one. I haven't seen the original, but, If I did, I will not make comparisons. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is real and natural. The flow keeps me glued to the screen till the end. The background music is a good choice and comes in at the right moment. I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and relatives.

    Leslie Charteris Would Probably Like This Movie

    Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.

    I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's. Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation. The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person. Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but...... I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another. If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!!!

    This movie might actually be more interesting viewed now as a 90s period piece than when it first came out in the real 90s. Since most of the movie takes place in post-glasnost Moscow, albeit with icy Canada often standing in for wintry Mother Russia, the viewer gets a nice sketch of the effects of the end of the cold war on the people and economy of the former Soviet Union. As an industrial espionage thriller, The Saint is fairly predictable, but Val Kilmer has fun with his character's master-of-disguise shtick playing several neat cameos within the film that re-defined gentleman adventurer Simon Templar for the 90s. Shue makes a credible appearance as a sheltered academic everywoman dragged into intrigue beyond her previous experience. As an added treat, this movie also features the 90s-topical idea of cold fusion, now long since de-bunked.

    This movie was horrendous. The plot was pathetic and non-original and the acting was painful to watch. As a matter of fact, I did not realize this was even Val Kilmer, that is how horrible it was. After we finished watching this atrocity, I looked it up on IMDb because I wanted to know who the actress was; she was just so unbearable and unable to perform her lines in a believable manner, I was convinced she was some 'unknown' that they got for cheap to go along with this low budget, below B movie. I was shocked to find out it was Elizabeth Shue...who, in my opinion, still cannot act her way out of a cracker jack box This movie was horrible. Painfully, banefully horrible! It should be burned from all archives and never spoken of again. I'd have given it a -10 (negative) if it would have been allowable...wouldn't even let me rate it a 0. It doesn't even deserve a 1. It was just that pathetic. If you value your eyes, ears and stomach...don't watch this thing

    This was an ambitious attempt to bring The Saint to the big screen and was probably not a bad idea but the casting of Val Kilmer in the title role and a tepid script give this a distinct B-movie feel. It might even be a cult classic by now. Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his very disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the name Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage. He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped. Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protect both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

    A lot of great action films came out in the 90s, this being one of them. The Saint is film about a master thief who disguises everything about his appearance, thus always staying one step ahead of the police. But when he is asked to steal scientific secrets from a beautiful researcher, he falls in love and for the first time becomes vulnerable. Val Kilmer does an amazing job with the part, with his many accents, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely beautiful, and Rade Serbedzija is fantastic as the villain. All of this plus a great soundtrack that could only come out of the 90s(especially the song "6 underground" by Sneaker Pimps) make this a fun movie. Don't miss it.
