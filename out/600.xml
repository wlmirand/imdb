  Robinson Crusoe flees Britain on a ship after killing his friend over the love of Mary. A fierce ocean storm wrecks his ship and leaves him stranded by himself on an uncharted island. Left to fend for himself, Crusoe seeks out a tentative survival on the island, until he meets Friday, a tribesman whom he saves from being sacrificed. Initially, Crusoe is thrilled to finally have a friend, but he has to defend himself against the tribe who uses the island to sacrifice tribesman to their gods. During time their relationship changes from master-slave to a mutual respected friendship despite their difference in culture and religion.

    I was very very disappointed in this movie. It fails to tell the tale of Robinson Crusoe. The only similarity between this movie and the book is a man getting shipwrecked. There was no build up at all. No explanation of the father explaining the middle life to his son and asking him to stay home. No description of initial journeys being a disaster and how he felt it was a sign from God. These are important elements to the story! If I had to pick one thing that really bothered me it would be the relationship between Robinson and Friday. In the book Friday is ALWAYS the slave. Robinson does eventually give Friday his freedom in the book but he still remains a servant. This sanitized version fails to keep us in the time setting of the book. The ending. Oh my. How clich&eacute;.

    Although this is far from a faithful adaption of Daniel Defoe's classic novel from the 18th century, this version of Robinson Crusoe holds up fairly well and captures what that polemic writer was trying to say about cultures and how they clash. A number of assumptions about what his character Crusoe had about the superiority of his civilization are shattered. Two men from totally different worlds manage to communicate and establish a friendship. To be sure it is one of necessity as Crusoe is cut off from his world and Friday, the cannibal he befriends is exiled from his tribe. Still they do get along until civilization intrudes. Pierce Brosnan is in the title role and aborigine actor William Takaku plays Friday. Defoe himself is written into the film as he is given a purported journal written by Crusoe and as he reads it Brosnan narrates the story. Defoe is played by Ian Hart and Defoe as political polemicist as well as novelist had some advanced views considering the time he lived in. Brosnan and Takaku do very well in their roles. It's a good story with moral if not plot intact.

    The only things that are the similar between the book and this movie are: 1. The name of the main character, Robinson Crusoe 2. The name of Friday 3. The fact that there was a shipwreck 4. The fact that Crusoe was stranded on an island. It was really an entirely different story. In the original story Robinson Crusoe has a Christian conscience which he violates by not listening to his father. It is an adaptation of the biblical parable of the Prodigal Son. "I resolved that I would, like a true repenting Prodigal go home to my Father"(Luke 15:11). "I had in five or six days got a compleat victory over Conscience" (p.8,9 Norton Critical Edition). In the book, the Bible plays a crucial role in the story. "I was earnestly begging God to give me repentance when it happened providentially the very day that reading the scripture I came to these words, 'He is exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and to give remission' (Acts 5:31)" "By now I began to exercise myself with new Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God and apply'd all the comforts to my daily State."(p.71, p 83) The whole story is a theological tract that deals with conversion, sanctification, and reconciliation (Crusoe himself) and the missionary work of evangelization and struggle of God's dealing with the heathen (Friday and the cannibals) ex. p156-160). Crusoe even leads Friday in a Bible study (p159). At one point, Crusoe struggles over whether he has the right to execute cannibals that had done nothing to him (p167-168). It also deals with the problem of fear, of theodicy, of evil, of original sin, and of many other theological themes. The book is full of prayers and reflections (mediations). In short, it is a thoroughly Protestant (Puritan) Christian story that edifies. The movie turns everything around and makes it a thoroughly post-modern- post-Christian; even anti-Christian story. Crusoe has to do everything himself, because he learned he can't rely on Providence. He argues with Friday over religion and then realizes that they should just co-exist and let Friday keep his concept of God while Crusoe keeps his. There is no conversion, no returning home to a father (either earthly or heavenly). Crusoe is an angry unconverted pseudo-Christian who is more confused than Friday and actually gets ministered to by Friday. I'm so thankful that this did not become a huge blockbuster. Young people today already are given enough wrong ideas about Christianity and religion.(the word compleat is the spelling in the original. Theodicy and evangelization seem to be two words that the people at IMDb have not learned yet)

    So. This is an adaptation of Daniel Defoe's story. A rather loose adaptation, I must say. It has the basic plot, but veers a little off course throughout in order to make the movie more entertaining and give it a little action. In itself, that's not a bad thing. I think the spirit of the book was kept, if not the letter. But hey! It's a reworking of a book written nearly three hundred years ago, so of course it's going to be prone to modern storytelling techniques and manipulation. It's basically a TV movie but they managed, somehow, to rope Pierce Brosnan into this. Not a bad thing, since he lends some credibility to the character of Crusoe. Since its been more than thirty years since I read the book, I won't try and pick faults with the screenplay's differences from the novel. Except just this one thing.... I don't remember the book well, but I'm almost positive that, in the book, there isn't a beach scene with white-painted palm trunks and a "NO Barbeques on the beach" sign. I blinked and had to rewind the DVR for that. But there it is. A shockingly badly chosen piece of stock footage with the aforementioned sign right in the foreground! Actually, it was too blurry to read anything other than the "NO" part. But it says "NO" something, that's for sure! I'm wondering if a second watch through will reveal tire-tracks in the sand, or discarded drinks cans, etc! Whoever left that in needs to be sacked. C'mon! Just cut that bit out. It only lasts a second or two! But its glaringly obvious. Talk about ruining immersion! Awful editing aside, Crusoe is not a bad film. It tries to send a message of tolerance and understanding, of friendship and love. For the most part, that succeeds fairly well but it is a trifle overdone. Crusoe's (Brosnan's) narration is sometimes needless but not distracting and the movie is fairly good entertainment if there's nothing better to watch. SUMMARY: Fairly decent TV movie. One hideous editing screw-up. Not too long. Worth watching if you have a couple of hours to kill.

    This on screen interpretation of Daniel Defoe's masterpiece is a mockery of the original. As typical of mainstream movie-making - the anti-Christian propaganda is badly veiled in artistic deviations from the book. Robinson's religious feelings are exaggerated and overblown. The pagan religion of Friday is presented as wiser and calmer. One cannot but sympathize with the wisdom and maturity of the cannibal. In the original Friday becomes a Christian and leaves the island with Robinson. Here Friday converts (almost) Robinson to the bliss of multiculturalism and diversity. In the book Friday lives, here he dies. Otherwise the acting is good and believable - Brosnan and the man acting as Friday deliver. However, the ideological agenda of the Hollywood of the late 1990s spoils the fun.

    I think this film is for everybody and the film is great. While I was reading Robinson Crusoe, I wanted to watch the Robinson Crusoe of film. Robinson loves sea so he goes on a journey and one day ship sunk. Sea wafted Robinson. Robinson reached the land but there are not people here. This is İsland. He was afraid and he walked around the İsland. He found a cave twenty four years later. Somebody came to the İsland. He captured one of them. In short he had got eventful life and he stayed at İsland just about twenty eight years.Events was very excited and fluent. Actors were very good. Daniel Defoe is the writer of this film.The film's stars are Pierce Brosnan, William Takaku, Polly Walker and other actors. I suggest the film because I like very much but you should read the film's book, in my opinion

    Brosnan is excellent as Robinson Crusoe and the actor playing Friday also does a decent job. There's plenty of adventure and excitement and the movie really chugs along. There is excessive violence and some very implausible battling of the cannibal tribe that comes to the island. Overall however, it makes for a rather entertaining film. My big problem is that it's titled "DANIEL DEFOE'S ROBINSON CRUSOE". It is not. It is well beyond an adaptation or artistic license. It has been many years since I read the book as a kid and as I watched the movie I was thinking - I don't remember a duel with swords. I don't remember this or that. Didn't Crusoe convert Friday to Christianity? And I don't remember Crusoe and Friday going back to Friday's island. In the book, they didn't. It wasn't my memory, it was the movie. The book is a true classic - the movie is okay but not at all true to the book.

    I am a big fan of PB, I was calling for him to take on the 007 role the first tie I ever saw him. I take no pride in what I'm about to say. I don't mind that the movie basically only uses the title and character names from the book; not at all, it's a movie based on the book, but absolutely nothing like the book; and I am fine with that, but here's the thing...... I watched the movie on HULU, I thought to myself, "why would this be on HULU?" as the movie began it wasn't bad at all; it kind of reminded me of "the count of monte cristo." I thought to myself, "why is this on HULU?" I have never seen a movie that started "OK" and progressively got worse and worse. I don't know if it was the writing, directing, acting, editing, or all of the above; all I know is that I kept saying to myself, "I can't believe that this is getting worse and worse." I guess that everyone misfires now and then, and I still like PB, but I am embarrassed for him about this movie.

    The Scottish accent is horrible, and obviously a person trying to do a Scots accent instead of someone who actually has one; and some scenes tied to the Scottish side are bad, too. But at the same time, none of the scenes in this film are nearly as boring as many of the scenes in the book, which - though a classic, and rightly regarded as such - suffers badly from age and its role as the "first novel", in that nobody had quite figured out things like pacing just yet. In short...it's an average movie, not good, and not bad either. Worth a watch if it comes on TV, and not as inclined to bore you out of your skull as the book. And to those who truly love the book...I applaud your patience. As a child of the digital age, my tolerance for descriptions of fence-building is extremely lacking.

    I don't know why people are so down on this movie. Why does every movie made from a book have to be faithful to every bit of dialogue or thought? What happened to poetic license? So what it's not faithful to the book. It's a really entertaining and touching movie with a moral. It made me want to open my copy of the book and actually re-read it. You people need to lighten up! Pierce Brosnan is wonderful and yes, I forgot his James Bond persona when watching. Mr. Takaku is wonderful too. He brings a dignity to the character that is certainly not in the book. The movie version brings up some interesting racial and religious sidebars too, which are handled very nicely. I have seen this movie several times and the ending is always heart-wrenching. I end up in tears every time. No it's not Academy Award stuff but it's very worthwhile watching. All in all a nice little gem of a movie. Enjoy!

    I don't know why people are so down on this movie. Why does every movie made from a book have to be faithful to every bit of dialogue or thought? What happened to poetic license? So what it's not faithful to the book. It's a really entertaining and touching movie with a moral. It made me want to open my copy of the book and actually re-read it. You people need to lighten up! Pierce Brosnan is wonderful and yes, I forgot his James Bond persona when watching. Mr. Takaku is wonderful too. He brings a dignity to the character that is certainly not in the book. The movie version brings up some interesting racial and religious sidebars too, which are handled very nicely. I have seen this movie several times and the ending is always heart-wrenching. I end up in tears every time. No it's not Academy Award stuff but it's very worthwhile watching. All in all a nice little gem of a movie. Enjoy!

    I was very very disappointed in this movie. It fails to tell the tale of Robinson Crusoe. The only similarity between this movie and the book is a man getting shipwrecked. There was no build up at all. No explanation of the father explaining the middle life to his son and asking him to stay home. No description of initial journeys being a disaster and how he felt it was a sign from God. These are important elements to the story! If I had to pick one thing that really bothered me it would be the relationship between Robinson and Friday. In the book Friday is ALWAYS the slave. Robinson does eventually give Friday his freedom in the book but he still remains a servant. This sanitized version fails to keep us in the time setting of the book. The ending. Oh my. How clich&eacute;.

    Although this is far from a faithful adaption of Daniel Defoe's classic novel from the 18th century, this version of Robinson Crusoe holds up fairly well and captures what that polemic writer was trying to say about cultures and how they clash. A number of assumptions about what his character Crusoe had about the superiority of his civilization are shattered. Two men from totally different worlds manage to communicate and establish a friendship. To be sure it is one of necessity as Crusoe is cut off from his world and Friday, the cannibal he befriends is exiled from his tribe. Still they do get along until civilization intrudes. Pierce Brosnan is in the title role and aborigine actor William Takaku plays Friday. Defoe himself is written into the film as he is given a purported journal written by Crusoe and as he reads it Brosnan narrates the story. Defoe is played by Ian Hart and Defoe as political polemicist as well as novelist had some advanced views considering the time he lived in. Brosnan and Takaku do very well in their roles. It's a good story with moral if not plot intact.

    The only things that are the similar between the book and this movie are: 1. The name of the main character, Robinson Crusoe 2. The name of Friday 3. The fact that there was a shipwreck 4. The fact that Crusoe was stranded on an island. It was really an entirely different story. In the original story Robinson Crusoe has a Christian conscience which he violates by not listening to his father. It is an adaptation of the biblical parable of the Prodigal Son. "I resolved that I would, like a true repenting Prodigal go home to my Father"(Luke 15:11). "I had in five or six days got a compleat victory over Conscience" (p.8,9 Norton Critical Edition). In the book, the Bible plays a crucial role in the story. "I was earnestly begging God to give me repentance when it happened providentially the very day that reading the scripture I came to these words, 'He is exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and to give remission' (Acts 5:31)" "By now I began to exercise myself with new Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God and apply'd all the comforts to my daily State."(p.71, p 83) The whole story is a theological tract that deals with conversion, sanctification, and reconciliation (Crusoe himself) and the missionary work of evangelization and struggle of God's dealing with the heathen (Friday and the cannibals) ex. p156-160). Crusoe even leads Friday in a Bible study (p159). At one point, Crusoe struggles over whether he has the right to execute cannibals that had done nothing to him (p167-168). It also deals with the problem of fear, of theodicy, of evil, of original sin, and of many other theological themes. The book is full of prayers and reflections (mediations). In short, it is a thoroughly Protestant (Puritan) Christian story that edifies. The movie turns everything around and makes it a thoroughly post-modern- post-Christian; even anti-Christian story. Crusoe has to do everything himself, because he learned he can't rely on Providence. He argues with Friday over religion and then realizes that they should just co-exist and let Friday keep his concept of God while Crusoe keeps his. There is no conversion, no returning home to a father (either earthly or heavenly). Crusoe is an angry unconverted pseudo-Christian who is more confused than Friday and actually gets ministered to by Friday. I'm so thankful that this did not become a huge blockbuster. Young people today already are given enough wrong ideas about Christianity and religion.(the word compleat is the spelling in the original. Theodicy and evangelization seem to be two words that the people at IMDb have not learned yet)

    So. This is an adaptation of Daniel Defoe's story. A rather loose adaptation, I must say. It has the basic plot, but veers a little off course throughout in order to make the movie more entertaining and give it a little action. In itself, that's not a bad thing. I think the spirit of the book was kept, if not the letter. But hey! It's a reworking of a book written nearly three hundred years ago, so of course it's going to be prone to modern storytelling techniques and manipulation. It's basically a TV movie but they managed, somehow, to rope Pierce Brosnan into this. Not a bad thing, since he lends some credibility to the character of Crusoe. Since its been more than thirty years since I read the book, I won't try and pick faults with the screenplay's differences from the novel. Except just this one thing.... I don't remember the book well, but I'm almost positive that, in the book, there isn't a beach scene with white-painted palm trunks and a "NO Barbeques on the beach" sign. I blinked and had to rewind the DVR for that. But there it is. A shockingly badly chosen piece of stock footage with the aforementioned sign right in the foreground! Actually, it was too blurry to read anything other than the "NO" part. But it says "NO" something, that's for sure! I'm wondering if a second watch through will reveal tire-tracks in the sand, or discarded drinks cans, etc! Whoever left that in needs to be sacked. C'mon! Just cut that bit out. It only lasts a second or two! But its glaringly obvious. Talk about ruining immersion! Awful editing aside, Crusoe is not a bad film. It tries to send a message of tolerance and understanding, of friendship and love. For the most part, that succeeds fairly well but it is a trifle overdone. Crusoe's (Brosnan's) narration is sometimes needless but not distracting and the movie is fairly good entertainment if there's nothing better to watch. SUMMARY: Fairly decent TV movie. One hideous editing screw-up. Not too long. Worth watching if you have a couple of hours to kill.

    This on screen interpretation of Daniel Defoe's masterpiece is a mockery of the original. As typical of mainstream movie-making - the anti-Christian propaganda is badly veiled in artistic deviations from the book. Robinson's religious feelings are exaggerated and overblown. The pagan religion of Friday is presented as wiser and calmer. One cannot but sympathize with the wisdom and maturity of the cannibal. In the original Friday becomes a Christian and leaves the island with Robinson. Here Friday converts (almost) Robinson to the bliss of multiculturalism and diversity. In the book Friday lives, here he dies. Otherwise the acting is good and believable - Brosnan and the man acting as Friday deliver. However, the ideological agenda of the Hollywood of the late 1990s spoils the fun.

    I think this film is for everybody and the film is great. While I was reading Robinson Crusoe, I wanted to watch the Robinson Crusoe of film. Robinson loves sea so he goes on a journey and one day ship sunk. Sea wafted Robinson. Robinson reached the land but there are not people here. This is İsland. He was afraid and he walked around the İsland. He found a cave twenty four years later. Somebody came to the İsland. He captured one of them. In short he had got eventful life and he stayed at İsland just about twenty eight years.Events was very excited and fluent. Actors were very good. Daniel Defoe is the writer of this film.The film's stars are Pierce Brosnan, William Takaku, Polly Walker and other actors. I suggest the film because I like very much but you should read the film's book, in my opinion

    Brosnan is excellent as Robinson Crusoe and the actor playing Friday also does a decent job. There's plenty of adventure and excitement and the movie really chugs along. There is excessive violence and some very implausible battling of the cannibal tribe that comes to the island. Overall however, it makes for a rather entertaining film. My big problem is that it's titled "DANIEL DEFOE'S ROBINSON CRUSOE". It is not. It is well beyond an adaptation or artistic license. It has been many years since I read the book as a kid and as I watched the movie I was thinking - I don't remember a duel with swords. I don't remember this or that. Didn't Crusoe convert Friday to Christianity? And I don't remember Crusoe and Friday going back to Friday's island. In the book, they didn't. It wasn't my memory, it was the movie. The book is a true classic - the movie is okay but not at all true to the book.

    I am a big fan of PB, I was calling for him to take on the 007 role the first tie I ever saw him. I take no pride in what I'm about to say. I don't mind that the movie basically only uses the title and character names from the book; not at all, it's a movie based on the book, but absolutely nothing like the book; and I am fine with that, but here's the thing...... I watched the movie on HULU, I thought to myself, "why would this be on HULU?" as the movie began it wasn't bad at all; it kind of reminded me of "the count of monte cristo." I thought to myself, "why is this on HULU?" I have never seen a movie that started "OK" and progressively got worse and worse. I don't know if it was the writing, directing, acting, editing, or all of the above; all I know is that I kept saying to myself, "I can't believe that this is getting worse and worse." I guess that everyone misfires now and then, and I still like PB, but I am embarrassed for him about this movie.

    The Scottish accent is horrible, and obviously a person trying to do a Scots accent instead of someone who actually has one; and some scenes tied to the Scottish side are bad, too. But at the same time, none of the scenes in this film are nearly as boring as many of the scenes in the book, which - though a classic, and rightly regarded as such - suffers badly from age and its role as the "first novel", in that nobody had quite figured out things like pacing just yet. In short...it's an average movie, not good, and not bad either. Worth a watch if it comes on TV, and not as inclined to bore you out of your skull as the book. And to those who truly love the book...I applaud your patience. As a child of the digital age, my tolerance for descriptions of fence-building is extremely lacking.
