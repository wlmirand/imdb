    Seen-it-all-before sequel, the fourth in the apparently endless 'Children of the Corn' series. Naomi Watts is a doctor returning to her home town only to discover a bizarre contagion amongst the town's kids. Needless to say, it's not the flu; pretty soon the corn cult raises its weary head, and the 'terror' begins. Not only is this instalment repetitious and clich&eacute;d - we're treated to numerous false scares, gory deaths and dream sequences - but the build up is completely redundant because any mystery surrounding what's going on has been made abundantly clear by the previous three films in the series. At least William Windom is on hand to be as likable as always, but unfortunately he's not in it enough to make me forget how many times I've already seen this movie.

    All the kids in a town over night become feverish and have convulsions. The next day they start to become evil, change their names for those of kids killed long ago, and then start killing any adult in their path, in vicious and mysterious forms. Not only does this film star talented actresses like Karen Black and a young Naomi Watts, but the direction is very solid and great performances were given by everyone. Others have said this is the best film in the series (even outdoing the original), and I think that a case could be made for that. Certainly it is better than part three, which is ironic considering that this film was straight-to-video and part three actually appeared in theaters. The entire franchise is a bit silly, and how it resulted in so many sequels (seven?) is beyond me. The original is now considered a classic, but I am not entirely sure why. It seems like the idea was to make as many sequels as possible until the original had to be considered a classic by default.

    When children in a town mysteriously get high fevers...blah blah Naomi Watts is in this and shes hot. The film is a big improvement over COTC III: Urban Harvest or as I like to call Children of the Corn III: Trying to be Hip. This film is pretty creepy and I always remember seeing the previews for it when I was a child before Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers which is an awful in & out. It's one of the few COTC films that I remember renting in video stores along with COTC II. I developed a crush on Naomi Watts and wanted to see her in more things and later on she became the Scream Queen for Classy Horror films I never understood why all 90's films have the same sideways camera angle but hopefully I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

    Children of the Corn 4 is much more thought out than the rest of the sequels. The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of "he who walks behind the rows" giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film. Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways. The big plot reveal (told to viewers near the end of the film) is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself (a lie child). That child is Grace's "sister" Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting. There were some gory moments and genuinely scary scenes which was missing from the third film. I recommend it. Acting was great (Naomi Watts), had a good story...definitely one of the better sequels in the franchise. 6/10

    This time in the movies of this horror series based on works by Stephen King, a medical student who has moved to the country races to discover what evil force is holding sway with the town's children. It as some really good intents moments in this movie and story flowed really well with movie. I really enjoyed some of the real cool deaths scene in this movie, which were real well made and can be tad gory, some of the deaths were real cleaver. The acting in this was decent from the whole cast! I enjoyed this movie good movies but it was not as good as the Children of the corn 3 but i am still going to give this movie a 5 out of 10

    basically c.o.t.c 4 has nothing at all to do with the last three movies at all it's basically children killing some adults but there's corn fields so really that is thee only connection it has with the rest of the movies there is no cult gatherings of a preacher leading a group of children to rebel against the adults it's just thus dead preacher you see some times through the movie thats about it. the acting good and the plot is OK but would've been better if there was a bit more sense to it like more detail as in why the the two main leading adult character's think something is up with the children instead of automatically knowing something is. like the first death sequence where after Marcus's mum's dead he just goes over and climbs over the corn and into the corn field. and the farther presumes somethings weird about him instead of thinking hey his mums just dead he might be in shock. but watch it for yourself you might just like it

    The movie starts off with a dream sequence. And get used to it  because this will be the 1st of at least 183 dream sequences this movie has. Unfortunately my beloved Gatlin is nowhere to be found as they have set this movie in another fictional Nebraska town with rows of cornfields. Not that much time is spent in the corn seeing as everyone is too busy sleeping and having dreams. A bored young woman named Grace comes home to NOT Gatlin to help take care of her nut bar mother and her much, much younger siblings and to look and seem bored. Soon after the kids get high temperatures and start becoming reincarnations of kids from way back. Or so I assume, it was easy to fade in and out of this movie. Bored Grace teams up with what's his face and they attempt to save the freaking day. Kudos to Grace for still managing to look bored even when faced with dead bodies and mortal peril. It's her thing and she's sticking with it. One thing I love with the Children of the Corn series is that each movie comes up with completely different explanations for why the kids go crazy and He Who Walks behind the Rows. So far everything from Indian legend to Satan to child abuse and the black arts has been used, with this we have an origin story of a boy preacher in 1800's who was forced to stay young otherwise Coca Cola would take away his sponsorship. Faced with this horrifying aspect he turned eeeeeeevil and......*YAWWWWWN* I'm over it. After a few more dream sequences and a few scenes of Grace turning up and looking bored, the movie thankfully ends; I didn't even have a favourite death. That makes me sad. I'm going to have to go watch Friday the 13th part 8  Jason Takes Manhattan to make myself feel better. Oh yea and Grace's sister turns out to be her daughter. Trust me, that's not a spoiler anyone could see that 'plot twist' coming from the get go. Just because it's a horror movie sequel doesn't mean that slack lazy writing needs to be the order of the day movie people. Next up: Children of the Corn 5  Sex and the Corn

    ***SPOILERS*** The 4th installment of "He who walks behind the Rows" who's never even mentioned, much less seen, once in the movie. We do have a corn filed in it that has really nothing to do with the plot but has the local town's sheriff Biggs of Grand Island Nebraska, Richard Gross, slaughtered in it while out at night looking for runaway Marcus Atkins, Lewis Flanagan III. Marcus went a bit nuts after he was infected with a mysterious illness that made him forget who he is and start thinking that he's in fact someone else. Like all the other kids of Grand Island who were infected by it. We have pre-med student Grace Rhodes, Naoma Watts, traveling home to Grand Island to visit her crazy mom June, Karen Black, and her 14 year old brother James, Mark Salling,and younger sister Margaret, Jamie Renee Smith, for the summer. It's then that Grace gets a job with the town physician Doc Larson, William Windom, whom she worked for before going away to collage. It's at Doc's clinic that strange things begin to happen with it suddenly being overcrowded with children who came down with high fevers and suffering from mercury poisoning. No one knows what's causing these strange maladies until we get the low down towards the end of the movie from the elderly and almost senile Nock sisters Jane & Rosa, Salle Ellis & Marietta Marich, about some boy preacher named Josiah who was kept young by his followers by stuffing him with mercury in order to stunt his growth. It's seems that the preacher boy was later burned at the stake by his disappointed, in him growing up, followers and is now back seeking revenge by getting the children of the town to slaughter all the adults for what they, or their parents and grand parents, did to him. There's also the side story to who's to replace this Josiah who's to come from the same background that he came from: In being abounded by his or her parents. Very confusing story especially in what the purpose in it is of showing grasshoppers or locust as evil messenger's of the devil without explaining why. We do in fact have some very shocking slasher, with the use of a scythe, scenes in it that makes the movie worth watching if you have the stomach to see them through. Even these scenes get a bit overdone with in one case poor Doc Larson who was cut in two earlier in the film getting shot to pieces by his assistant Grace, who didn't recognize him, with a shotgun as his other half, the bottom part of his body, was lying in state. ***SPOILERS*** It's Mr, Donald Atkins, Brant Jennings, young Marcus's dad who finally finds the magic bullet, filled with mercury, that can put an end to this horror. Atkins together with Grace drives down to the old Spelling Barn where the possessed town children are holding a rally, or human sacrifice, in order to save them from themselves. Even though Donald did the driving through the corn field it was Grace who did the blasting with her shotgun who finally put an end to this bloody, with all the kids cutting their hands open and dripping their blood into what looked like a wooden punchbowl, insanity. That's until the next cornball "Children of the Corn" flick comes to video store of theater near you to start it all over again.

    This movie is a real ridicules one with its story but at least he movie is a well made one, which still makes the movie a decent one. To be honest, I really liked the movie during its first halve. The movie however then turns South pretty fast when so much ridicules is happening that you just start to loose interest. It's first halve was still mainly build-up, it's too bad that the pay off was not halve as good however. None of the Children of the Corn movies have a real believable concept or story of course. The whole idea behind the movies is pretty tiresome but at least some of them still have some good horror moments in it. Fans of the genre shall therefore still somewhat enjoy this movie as well. The movie is being pretty good with its horror, which makes it all the more too bad that too little is actually happening in the movie, due to the fact that it just doesn't have a very good pay off, after its fine build up. You still feel that director Greg Spence understands the genre, so lets hope he'll do something good with it some day. The previous entry in the series had Charlize Theron in it, in her very first movie role. Her role was about 15 seconds long however. This movie has Naomi Watts in it before she got famous. And yes, her role is much bigger. She actually is the main lead of the movie and she shows her talents. She makes her character a good one, while basically ever other young actress would had turned the characters into an annoying, helpless young adult, like you'll see in so many other genre movies like this. It also has Karen Black in it, who perhaps should had got a bit of a bigger role in the movie. There was plenty of room for it but for some reason they decided not to give her more to do in the movie. It's a pretty well made and good looking movie, though you'll probably start to loose interest fast once the second halve of it kicks in. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

It's then that Grace gets a job with the town physician Doc Larson, William Windom, whom she worked for before going away to collage. It's at Doc's clinic that strange things begin to happen with it suddenly being overcrowded with children who came down with high fevers and suffering from mercury poisoning. No one knows what's causing these strange maladies until we get the low down towards the end of the movie from the elderly and almost senile Nock sisters Jane & Rosa, Salle Ellis & Marietta Marich, about some boy preacher named Josiah who was kept young by his followers by stuffing him with mercury in order to stunt his growth. It's seems that the preacher boy was later burned at the stake by his disappointed, in him growing up, followers and is now back seeking revenge by getting the children of the town to slaughter all the adults for what they, or their parents and grand parents, did to him. There's also the side story to who's to replace this Josiah who's to come from the same background that he came from: In being abounded by his or her parents. Very confusing story especially in what the purpose in it is of showing grasshoppers or locust as evil messenger's of the devil without explaining why. We do in fact have some very shocking slasher, with the use of a scythe, scenes in it that makes the movie worth watching if you have the stomach to see them through. Even these scenes get a bit overdone with in one case poor Doc Larson who was cut in two earlier in the film getting shot to pieces by his assistant Grace, who didn't recognize him, with a shotgun as his other half, the bottom part of his body, was lying in state. ***SPOILERS*** It's Mr, Donald Atkins, Brant Jennings, young Marcus's dad who finally finds the magic bullet, filled with mercury, that can put an end to this horror. Atkins together with Grace drives down to the old Spelling Barn where the possessed town children are holding a rally, or human sacrifice, in order to save them from themselves. Even though Donald did the driving through the corn field it was Grace who did the blasting with her shotgun who finally put an end to this bloody, with all the kids cutting their hands open and dripping their blood into what looked like a wooden punchbowl, insanity. That's until the next cornball "Children of the Corn" flick comes to video store of theater near you to start it all over again.

    This movie is a real ridicules one with its story but at least he movie is a well made one, which still makes the movie a decent one. To be honest, I really liked the movie during its first halve. The movie however then turns South pretty fast when so much ridicules is happening that you just start to loose interest. It's first halve was still mainly build-up, it's too bad that the pay off was not halve as good however. None of the Children of the Corn movies have a real believable concept or story of course. The whole idea behind the movies is pretty tiresome but at least some of them still have some good horror moments in it. Fans of the genre shall therefore still somewhat enjoy this movie as well. The movie is being pretty good with its horror, which makes it all the more too bad that too little is actually happening in the movie, due to the fact that it just doesn't have a very good pay off, after its fine build up. You still feel that director Greg Spence understands the genre, so lets hope he'll do something good with it some day. The previous entry in the series had Charlize Theron in it, in her very first movie role. Her role was about 15 seconds long however. This movie has Naomi Watts in it before she got famous. And yes, her role is much bigger. She actually is the main lead of the movie and she shows her talents. She makes her character a good one, while basically ever other young actress would had turned the characters into an annoying, helpless young adult, like you'll see in so many other genre movies like this. It also has Karen Black in it, who perhaps should had got a bit of a bigger role in the movie. There was plenty of room for it but for some reason they decided not to give her more to do in the movie. It's a pretty well made and good looking movie, though you'll probably start to loose interest fast once the second halve of it kicks in. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Seen-it-all-before sequel, the fourth in the apparently endless 'Children of the Corn' series. Naomi Watts is a doctor returning to her home town only to discover a bizarre contagion amongst the town's kids. Needless to say, it's not the flu; pretty soon the corn cult raises its weary head, and the 'terror' begins. Not only is this instalment repetitious and clich&eacute;d - we're treated to numerous false scares, gory deaths and dream sequences - but the build up is completely redundant because any mystery surrounding what's going on has been made abundantly clear by the previous three films in the series. At least William Windom is on hand to be as likable as always, but unfortunately he's not in it enough to make me forget how many times I've already seen this movie.

    All the kids in a town over night become feverish and have convulsions. The next day they start to become evil, change their names for those of kids killed long ago, and then start killing any adult in their path, in vicious and mysterious forms. Not only does this film star talented actresses like Karen Black and a young Naomi Watts, but the direction is very solid and great performances were given by everyone. Others have said this is the best film in the series (even outdoing the original), and I think that a case could be made for that. Certainly it is better than part three, which is ironic considering that this film was straight-to-video and part three actually appeared in theaters. The entire franchise is a bit silly, and how it resulted in so many sequels (seven?) is beyond me. The original is now considered a classic, but I am not entirely sure why. It seems like the idea was to make as many sequels as possible until the original had to be considered a classic by default.

    When children in a town mysteriously get high fevers...blah blah Naomi Watts is in this and shes hot. The film is a big improvement over COTC III: Urban Harvest or as I like to call Children of the Corn III: Trying to be Hip. This film is pretty creepy and I always remember seeing the previews for it when I was a child before Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers which is an awful in & out. It's one of the few COTC films that I remember renting in video stores along with COTC II. I developed a crush on Naomi Watts and wanted to see her in more things and later on she became the Scream Queen for Classy Horror films I never understood why all 90's films have the same sideways camera angle but hopefully I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

    Children of the Corn 4 is much more thought out than the rest of the sequels. The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of "he who walks behind the rows" giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film. Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways. The big plot reveal (told to viewers near the end of the film) is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself (a lie child). That child is Grace's "sister" Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting. There were some gory moments and genuinely scary scenes which was missing from the third film. I recommend it. Acting was great (Naomi Watts), had a good story...definitely one of the better sequels in the franchise. 6/10

    This time in the movies of this horror series based on works by Stephen King, a medical student who has moved to the country races to discover what evil force is holding sway with the town's children. It as some really good intents moments in this movie and story flowed really well with movie. I really enjoyed some of the real cool deaths scene in this movie, which were real well made and can be tad gory, some of the deaths were real cleaver. The acting in this was decent from the whole cast! I enjoyed this movie good movies but it was not as good as the Children of the corn 3 but i am still going to give this movie a 5 out of 10

    The movie starts off with a dream sequence. And get used to it  because this will be the 1st of at least 183 dream sequences this movie has. Unfortunately my beloved Gatlin is nowhere to be found as they have set this movie in another fictional Nebraska town with rows of cornfields. Not that much time is spent in the corn seeing as everyone is too busy sleeping and having dreams. A bored young woman named Grace comes home to NOT Gatlin to help take care of her nut bar mother and her much, much younger siblings and to look and seem bored. Soon after the kids get high temperatures and start becoming reincarnations of kids from way back. Or so I assume, it was easy to fade in and out of this movie. Bored Grace teams up with what's his face and they attempt to save the freaking day. Kudos to Grace for still managing to look bored even when faced with dead bodies and mortal peril. It's her thing and she's sticking with it. One thing I love with the Children of the Corn series is that each movie comes up with completely different explanations for why the kids go crazy and He Who Walks behind the Rows. So far everything from Indian legend to Satan to child abuse and the black arts has been used, with this we have an origin story of a boy preacher in 1800's who was forced to stay young otherwise Coca Cola would take away his sponsorship. Faced with this horrifying aspect he turned eeeeeeevil and......*YAWWWWWN* I'm over it. After a few more dream sequences and a few scenes of Grace turning up and looking bored, the movie thankfully ends; I didn't even have a favourite death. That makes me sad. I'm going to have to go watch Friday the 13th part 8  Jason Takes Manhattan to make myself feel better. Oh yea and Grace's sister turns out to be her daughter. Trust me, that's not a spoiler anyone could see that 'plot twist' coming from the get go. Just because it's a horror movie sequel doesn't mean that slack lazy writing needs to be the order of the day movie people. Next up: Children of the Corn 5  Sex and the Corn

    ***SPOILERS*** The 4th installment of "He who walks behind the Rows" who's never even mentioned, much less seen, once in the movie. We do have a corn filed in it that has really nothing to do with the plot but has the local town's sheriff Biggs of Grand Island Nebraska, Richard Gross, slaughtered in it while out at night looking for runaway Marcus Atkins, Lewis Flanagan III. Marcus went a bit nuts after he was infected with a mysterious illness that made him forget who he is and start thinking that he's in fact someone else. Like all the other kids of Grand Island who were infected by it. We have pre-med student Grace Rhodes, Naoma Watts, traveling home to Grand Island to visit her crazy mom June, Karen Black, and her 14 year old brother James, Mark Salling,and younger sister Margaret, Jamie Renee Smith, for the summer. It's then that Grace gets a job with the town physician Doc Larson, William Windom, whom she worked for before going away to collage. It's at Doc's clinic that strange things begin to happen with it suddenly being overcrowded with children who came down with high fevers and suffering from mercury poisoning. No one knows what's causing these strange maladies until we get the low down towards the end of the movie from the elderly and almost senile Nock sisters Jane & Rosa, Salle Ellis & Marietta Marich, about some boy preacher named Josiah who was kept young by his followers by stuffing him with mercury in order to stunt his growth. It's seems that the preacher boy was later burned at the stake by his disappointed, in him growing up, followers and is now back seeking revenge by getting the children of the town to slaughter all the adults for what they, or their parents and grand parents, did to him. There's also the side story to who's to replace this Josiah who's to come from the same background that he came from: In being abounded by his or her parents. Very confusing story especially in what the purpose in it is of showing grasshoppers or locust as evil messenger's of the devil without explaining why. We do in fact have some very shocking slasher, with the use of a scythe, scenes in it that makes the movie worth watching if you have the stomach to see them through. Even these scenes get a bit overdone with in one case poor Doc Larson who was cut in two earlier in the film getting shot to pieces by his assistant Grace, who didn't recognize him, with a shotgun as his other half, the bottom part of his body, was lying in state. ***SPOILERS*** It's Mr, Donald Atkins, Brant Jennings, young Marcus's dad who finally finds the magic bullet, filled with mercury, that can put an end to this horror. Atkins together with Grace drives down to the old Spelling Barn where the possessed town children are holding a rally, or human sacrifice, in order to save them from themselves. Even though Donald did the driving through the corn field it was Grace who did the blasting with her shotgun who finally put an end to this bloody, with all the kids cutting their hands open and dripping their blood into what looked like a wooden punchbowl, insanity. That's until the next cornball "Children of the Corn" flick comes to video store of theater near you to start it all over again.

It's her thing and she's sticking with it. One thing I love with the Children of the Corn series is that each movie comes up with completely different explanations for why the kids go crazy and He Who Walks behind the Rows. So far everything from Indian legend to Satan to child abuse and the black arts has been used, with this we have an origin story of a boy preacher in 1800's who was forced to stay young otherwise Coca Cola would take away his sponsorship. Faced with this horrifying aspect he turned eeeeeeevil and......*YAWWWWWN* I'm over it. After a few more dream sequences and a few scenes of Grace turning up and looking bored, the movie thankfully ends; I didn't even have a favourite death. That makes me sad. I'm going to have to go watch Friday the 13th part 8  Jason Takes Manhattan to make myself feel better. Oh yea and Grace's sister turns out to be her daughter. Trust me, that's not a spoiler anyone could see that 'plot twist' coming from the get go. Just because it's a horror movie sequel doesn't mean that slack lazy writing needs to be the order of the day movie people. Next up: Children of the Corn 5  Sex and the Corn

    ***SPOILERS*** The 4th installment of "He who walks behind the Rows" who's never even mentioned, much less seen, once in the movie. We do have a corn filed in it that has really nothing to do with the plot but has the local town's sheriff Biggs of Grand Island Nebraska, Richard Gross, slaughtered in it while out at night looking for runaway Marcus Atkins, Lewis Flanagan III. Marcus went a bit nuts after he was infected with a mysterious illness that made him forget who he is and start thinking that he's in fact someone else. Like all the other kids of Grand Island who were infected by it. We have pre-med student Grace Rhodes, Naoma Watts, traveling home to Grand Island to visit her crazy mom June, Karen Black, and her 14 year old brother James, Mark Salling,and younger sister Margaret, Jamie Renee Smith, for the summer. It's then that Grace gets a job with the town physician Doc Larson, William Windom, whom she worked for before going away to collage. It's at Doc's clinic that strange things begin to happen with it suddenly being overcrowded with children who came down with high fevers and suffering from mercury poisoning. No one knows what's causing these strange maladies until we get the low down towards the end of the movie from the elderly and almost senile Nock sisters Jane & Rosa, Salle Ellis & Marietta Marich, about some boy preacher named Josiah who was kept young by his followers by stuffing him with mercury in order to stunt his growth. It's seems that the preacher boy was later burned at the stake by his disappointed, in him growing up, followers and is now back seeking revenge by getting the children of the town to slaughter all the adults for what they, or their parents and grand parents, did to him. There's also the side story to who's to replace this Josiah who's to come from the same background that he came from: In being abounded by his or her parents. Very confusing story especially in what the purpose in it is of showing grasshoppers or locust as evil messenger's of the devil without explaining why. We do in fact have some very shocking slasher, with the use of a scythe, scenes in it that makes the movie worth watching if you have the stomach to see them through. Even these scenes get a bit overdone with in one case poor Doc Larson who was cut in two earlier in the film getting shot to pieces by his assistant Grace, who didn't recognize him, with a shotgun as his other half, the bottom part of his body, was lying in state. ***SPOILERS*** It's Mr, Donald Atkins, Brant Jennings, young Marcus's dad who finally finds the magic bullet, filled with mercury, that can put an end to this horror. Atkins together with Grace drives down to the old Spelling Barn where the possessed town children are holding a rally, or human sacrifice, in order to save them from themselves. Even though Donald did the driving through the corn field it was Grace who did the blasting with her shotgun who finally put an end to this bloody, with all the kids cutting their hands open and dripping their blood into what looked like a wooden punchbowl, insanity. That's until the next cornball "Children of the Corn" flick comes to video store of theater near you to start it all over again.

    This movie is a real ridicules one with its story but at least he movie is a well made one, which still makes the movie a decent one. To be honest, I really liked the movie during its first halve. The movie however then turns South pretty fast when so much ridicules is happening that you just start to loose interest. It's first halve was still mainly build-up, it's too bad that the pay off was not halve as good however. None of the Children of the Corn movies have a real believable concept or story of course. The whole idea behind the movies is pretty tiresome but at least some of them still have some good horror moments in it. Fans of the genre shall therefore still somewhat enjoy this movie as well. The movie is being pretty good with its horror, which makes it all the more too bad that too little is actually happening in the movie, due to the fact that it just doesn't have a very good pay off, after its fine build up. You still feel that director Greg Spence understands the genre, so lets hope he'll do something good with it some day. The previous entry in the series had Charlize Theron in it, in her very first movie role. Her role was about 15 seconds long however. This movie has Naomi Watts in it before she got famous. And yes, her role is much bigger. She actually is the main lead of the movie and she shows her talents. She makes her character a good one, while basically ever other young actress would had turned the characters into an annoying, helpless young adult, like you'll see in so many other genre movies like this. It also has Karen Black in it, who perhaps should had got a bit of a bigger role in the movie. There was plenty of room for it but for some reason they decided not to give her more to do in the movie. It's a pretty well made and good looking movie, though you'll probably start to loose interest fast once the second halve of it kicks in. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Seen-it-all-before sequel, the fourth in the apparently endless 'Children of the Corn' series. Naomi Watts is a doctor returning to her home town only to discover a bizarre contagion amongst the town's kids. Needless to say, it's not the flu; pretty soon the corn cult raises its weary head, and the 'terror' begins. Not only is this instalment repetitious and clich&eacute;d - we're treated to numerous false scares, gory deaths and dream sequences - but the build up is completely redundant because any mystery surrounding what's going on has been made abundantly clear by the previous three films in the series. At least William Windom is on hand to be as likable as always, but unfortunately he's not in it enough to make me forget how many times I've already seen this movie.

    All the kids in a town over night become feverish and have convulsions. The next day they start to become evil, change their names for those of kids killed long ago, and then start killing any adult in their path, in vicious and mysterious forms. Not only does this film star talented actresses like Karen Black and a young Naomi Watts, but the direction is very solid and great performances were given by everyone. Others have said this is the best film in the series (even outdoing the original), and I think that a case could be made for that. Certainly it is better than part three, which is ironic considering that this film was straight-to-video and part three actually appeared in theaters. The entire franchise is a bit silly, and how it resulted in so many sequels (seven?) is beyond me. The original is now considered a classic, but I am not entirely sure why. It seems like the idea was to make as many sequels as possible until the original had to be considered a classic by default.

    When children in a town mysteriously get high fevers...blah blah Naomi Watts is in this and shes hot. The film is a big improvement over COTC III: Urban Harvest or as I like to call Children of the Corn III: Trying to be Hip. This film is pretty creepy and I always remember seeing the previews for it when I was a child before Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers which is an awful in & out. It's one of the few COTC films that I remember renting in video stores along with COTC II. I developed a crush on Naomi Watts and wanted to see her in more things and later on she became the Scream Queen for Classy Horror films I never understood why all 90's films have the same sideways camera angle but hopefully I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

    Children of the Corn 4 is much more thought out than the rest of the sequels. The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of "he who walks behind the rows" giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film. Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways. The big plot reveal (told to viewers near the end of the film) is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself (a lie child). That child is Grace's "sister" Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting. There were some gory moments and genuinely scary scenes which was missing from the third film. I recommend it. Acting was great (Naomi Watts), had a good story...definitely one of the better sequels in the franchise. 6/10

    This time in the movies of this horror series based on works by Stephen King, a medical student who has moved to the country races to discover what evil force is holding sway with the town's children. It as some really good intents moments in this movie and story flowed really well with movie. I really enjoyed some of the real cool deaths scene in this movie, which were real well made and can be tad gory, some of the deaths were real cleaver. The acting in this was decent from the whole cast! I enjoyed this movie good movies but it was not as good as the Children of the corn 3 but i am still going to give this movie a 5 out of 10

    basically c.o.t.c 4 has nothing at all to do with the last three movies at all it's basically children killing some adults but there's corn fields so really that is thee only connection it has with the rest of the movies there is no cult gatherings of a preacher leading a group of children to rebel against the adults it's just thus dead preacher you see some times through the movie thats about it. the acting good and the plot is OK but would've been better if there was a bit more sense to it like more detail as in why the the two main leading adult character's think something is up with the children instead of automatically knowing something is. like the first death sequence where after Marcus's mum's dead he just goes over and climbs over the corn and into the corn field. and the farther presumes somethings weird about him instead of thinking hey his mums just dead he might be in shock. but watch it for yourself you might just like it

    Grace (Naomi Watts) comes home to Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her seemingly mentally ill mother, not knowing that all the children of said hometown have come under a unknowable affliction that has them murdering the older generation. All of this,of course, has jack all to do with any of the previous 3 films in the series. The acting runs from merely acceptable to sub-par, the plot line is extremely predictable, and the scares are nonexistent. Naomi would go on to decidedly better horror fare with The Ring films, while this franchise would continue to limp along in squaller never even reaching the low standard of mediocrity. And to think this was actually one of the 'better' COTC sequels. Chew on THAT for awhile. My Grade: D+

    The movie starts off with a dream sequence. And get used to it  because this will be the 1st of at least 183 dream sequences this movie has. Unfortunately my beloved Gatlin is nowhere to be found as they have set this movie in another fictional Nebraska town with rows of cornfields. Not that much time is spent in the corn seeing as everyone is too busy sleeping and having dreams. A bored young woman named Grace comes home to NOT Gatlin to help take care of her nut bar mother and her much, much younger siblings and to look and seem bored. Soon after the kids get high temperatures and start becoming reincarnations of kids from way back. Or so I assume, it was easy to fade in and out of this movie. Bored Grace teams up with what's his face and they attempt to save the freaking day. Kudos to Grace for still managing to look bored even when faced with dead bodies and mortal peril. It's her thing and she's sticking with it. One thing I love with the Children of the Corn series is that each movie comes up with completely different explanations for why the kids go crazy and He Who Walks behind the Rows. So far everything from Indian legend to Satan to child abuse and the black arts has been used, with this we have an origin story of a boy preacher in 1800's who was forced to stay young otherwise Coca Cola would take away his sponsorship. Faced with this horrifying aspect he turned eeeeeeevil and......*YAWWWWWN* I'm over it. After a few more dream sequences and a few scenes of Grace turning up and looking bored, the movie thankfully ends; I didn't even have a favourite death. That makes me sad. I'm going to have to go watch Friday the 13th part 8  Jason Takes Manhattan to make myself feel better. Oh yea and Grace's sister turns out to be her daughter. Trust me, that's not a spoiler anyone could see that 'plot twist' coming from the get go. Just because it's a horror movie sequel doesn't mean that slack lazy writing needs to be the order of the day movie people. Next up: Children of the Corn 5  Sex and the Corn
