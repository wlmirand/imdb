 <storyline>
  Andrew Crocker-Harris is an embittered and disliked teacher of Greek and Latin at a British public school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. The boys regard him as a Hitler, with some justification. His wife Laura is unfaithful, and lives to wound him any way she can. Andrew must come to terms with his failed life and regain at least his own self-respect.

    Contemporary remake of the Terence Rattingan play updated our era , formerly shot in 1951 . Classic play updated to modern times , it's worth watching for extraordinary performances from British all-star-cast and marvelous ambiances . Forced to retire from an English public school a disliked professor named Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney) must confront his utter failures as a teacher , a husband , and a man . The lonely unemotional classics instructor realizes his flops , being cuckolded by a colleague and denied a deserved pension by the penurious headmaster (Michael Gambon) . Although he began his career eighteen years earlier as a brilliant young scholar, he has withdrawn into the stiff rigidity of school rules and regimentation , now his professional humiliation and loveless existence have give him a defensive armour of coldness . How this armour is pierced makes for dramatic entertainment . While facing a bleak financial future and a disintegrating marriage , his cold-blooded wife (Greta Scacchi) into an affair with another teacher (Matthew Modine), but the kindness of one of his students rekindles his humanity . A towering portrait of a wasted life about an out-of-touch teacher who has distanced himself from all human emotion . It contains super works , thought-provoking drama and magnificent settings , though turns out to be slow-moving . Wonderful performance by Albert Finney as a stuffy professor of Classical Greek at an English public school who is disliked by his students . Awesome Greta Scacchi as his bitchy , faithless spouse and good acting by Matthew Modine as her Science-master lover and Julian Sands as a language teacher . In addition , Ben Silverston , Maryam D'Abo , Jim Sturgess , Oliver Milburn and special mention to Michael Gambon as the headmaster . Colour cinematography is awesome , it was splendidly photographed by Jean Francois Robin . Emotive as well as sensitive musical score by Mark Isham . Although the film is pretty good results to be inferior by using strong language and other reasons than classic version (1951) directed by Anthony Asquith and starred by Michael Redgrave as the hapless and unpopular schoolmaster , Jean Kent as the unfaithful wife , Nigel Patrick and Bill Travers . The motion picture was well directed by Mike Figgis , a good British filmmaker . He is an expert on dramas as &uml;Time code&uml;, &uml;The loss of sexual innocence&uml;, &uml;One night stand&uml; and Thillers as &uml;Liebestraum&uml; and &uml;Stormy Monday&uml;. &uml;Browning version&uml; is considered to be one of his best films . Better than average . Worthwhile seeing .

    A movie about coming to terms with a life that didn't turn out, at you thought it would, about the importance of little things, when the structure itself is crumbling. I don't know exactly what it was about this movie but it just hit me, where i live. I cried my eyes out, and it colored my emotions for weeks after-wards. It deals with most of the issues that an adult is faced with; marriage, work relations, personal identity, etc., from the viewpoint of an aging teacher, who does what he does, except it isn't really working, as he thought would. Social acceptance and respect is missing, his marriage is on the rocks. In a way he is like a mundane Horatio on the bridge, who keeps fighting, knowing all too well, that the fight is lost, hoping perhaps beyond hope, that one small victory is possible.

    1bilbo seems confused. The original is set in a public school (not a grammar school) and there is therefore a subliminal gay message in the pedagogue/pupil relationship (Playwright, director, and lead were all gay/bi) but also the resolution (arguably) of the cruel wife being abandoned by her lover in favour of manly friendship. Having been to a public school (in the 70s) I can also say that the study of Classics inevitably meant one became aware of homosexuality in a way that didn't happen with other subjects (Greeks, Romans, let it all hang loose and all that). I presume this is why 1bilbo favours the original as a paean to old-fashioned public school values. I don't like remakes and haven't seen this one, but the one thing of which I am certain is that Rattigan did not mean his play to be seen as a critique of widening of the education system to all classes (or alternatively the supremacy of private education). I am equally certain that 1bilbo has no idea of whether the comprehensive system has provided better or worse educated people as he (I am pretty certain he is a he) has never looked this up. What I am sure he cannot argue with is that having a large proportion of the country considering themselves rejects at 11 and being sent to sub-standard secondary moderns that didn't even teach the same exams (the almost worthless CSE anyone?) is not a good education system.

    The original "Browning Version", with Michael Redgrave, was note-perfect. This remake suffers in comparison. The main problem is that the Britain which was depicted in the original no longer exists. It was a Britain of sublimated emotions and understatement. The Britain of today - in which this version is set - is a much cruder and more obvious sort of place. Unfortunately the film makers tried to blend the two and it doesn't really work. One example: the scene where the kids play a prank on the school bully. It wasn't in the original and it adds nothing to this version. It just jerks the viewer unpleasantly into the present when the movie should be trying to keep him in the quiet, more subtle and more interesting atmosphere it had succeeded in creating at other times. On a positive note, the acting is generally very good, especially by Albert Finney as Crocker-Harris. Even though he is brilliant, he is at times misused. At one point, Crocker-Harris is moved to tears by the gift from Taplow, his most enthusiastic student, and the only one it seems who will miss him when he leaves the school. Finney's acting is fine. He plays the emotion well. The trouble is that the viewer is concentrating on evaluating just how well Finney is performing, rather than actually feeling the emotion. The correct way to direct this would have been to intimate briefly that Crocker-Harris is overcome by emotion but then have him turn away and perhaps have the camera pull back, is if it was embarrassed to be a witness to such a thing. In our imaginations we would have created the scene and would not have been kept emotionally distant from it. This film could have been a masterpiece if all the discordant, modern elements had been discarded and it had concentrated on presenting its theme in a unified, coherent voice.

    This was an unexpected jewel of a movie. If you like movies such as "Remains of the Day," you will enjoy this one. Against the backdrop of a traditional boys school in the English countryside, a teacher who is being forced out examines his life. This movie is well-done across the board--the rich if spare script (perfect), the cinematography, a well-integrated score, all perfectly paced. This movie and the characters in it have layers. The acting by Albert Finney and Greta Sacchi is masterful (Michael Gabon is good, too). All that, and it has an honest ending. This movie had my rapt attention from the opening scene, and I am certain to watch it again.

    The cast of the recently updated "The Browning Version" based on a play by the late Sir Terence Rattigan includes Albert Finney, Sir Michael Gambon, Greta Scacchi, and American actor, Matthew Modine. The film is first rate in art direction, costumes, and sets. The film's adaptation from the play is loosely based. Albert Finney deserved an Oscar nomination for playing Andrew Crocker Foster, a retiring Classics instructor at a private boys' school in England. His wife, Laura, is unhappy and carrying on with Modine's character, a science instructor. The scenes with Finney and the boy playing Taplow are unforgettable and probably the finest. This film is a quiet gem and highly underrated. It should be considered a classic because it's well done without over-doing it with theatrics. The film's subtle and goes by pretty fast as well.

    This is remake of "The Browning Version", great movie of Anthony Asquith. Here Michael Redgrave is replaced with one of my favorite British actors, Albert Finney. Finney plays Andrew Crocker-Harris, teacher of classic languages in a British prep school. He's disliked from students, his colleagues and his younger wife is being unfaithful to him. The only boy who likes Crocker-Harris is Taplow and they have special relationship that culminates with Taplow's gift that makes Crocker-Harris cry, in one of my favorite scenes of this movie. I also must add, that beside Finney, there is very good performance of Greta Scacchi as his wife. So why to watch this movie? Because of Albert Finney's tutoring skills!!! He gives hour and half of acting lesson to us all. Thank you Mr. Finney, you are a true legend.

    An excellent acting job by Albert Finney carries this movie to a higher level than its script. Supplemented by good jobs by Greta Scacci and Mathew Modine, Finney minimalistically conveys the potent points of his character's regrets, fears, and passions. A terror to his students, Crocker-Harris allows himself to be dominated and humiliated by the school, the system, and the loveless marriage he is in. Mathew Modine, inserted apparently for young appeal, does his best with his character's sympathy for his older colleague, whom he has cuckolded. Scacci does her best with the faithless wife who enjoys twisting the knife in her hapless, though outwardly strong, husband. Only eight of a possible ten stars due to the slight letdown of the teacher's parting speech, and the abruptness of the ending.

    I got this out one wet Sunday afternoon hoping for an inspirational school drama along the lines of "To sir with love" or "Dead poets society"-- something to moisten my eyes and make me think anything was possible. Boy was I wrong -- this muddling drama, which covers the last days of an old masters career at an English public school, was depressing from beginning to end. As each element of the masters tragic life was revealed to me, I kept wondering when the turn-around point would be. Surely this entire movie was not just going to be the telling of the sad life of an uninteresting man and an ineffective teacher -- surely there would be some rising climax to contrast the woe. But no! For the final speech scene which I hung on for, the master turned out the most embarrassing self pitying display I have ever seen on film -- something like my grandfather when he's had too many drinks at Christmas. Of course, the teachers and students dutifully applauded, shouted and stomped (to indicate to the viewer that this was indeed the climax) but I was just thought he was an old fool. There were admittedly some nice insights into human behavior and relationships and some good English upper-class mocking (tea and cricket chaps!) but the other characters never seemed to develop as if to save room for the central story. Unfortunately, the sad old teacher didn't developed beyond self-pity throughout the entire movie, leaving me with the definite impression that he "..got what he deserved, no more and certainly no less".

    Albert Finney and Greta Scacchi have given a fabulous performance. Indeed this is a rare gem in cinema. I give this 9 out of 10. The script is tight, the music score good and the performances are amazing. Its a simple story of a school teacher who is forced to retire. He finds no comfort in his retirement as he is denied his pension and there is absolutely no one in the school who is sad to see him go. Living with an unfaithful life, this school teacher lives a lonely life. Never to bow down to anyone and nor letting anyone sympathise with him, he portrays a classic and rare case of a strong human being. As i say this, it was sad to see him break down when a kid showers him a rare gift of love. If this movie does not touch your soul or move you, then you truly belong to the cold hearted. Keep a handkerchief ready. Please watch this movie. It is a masterpiece .

    Contemporary remake of the Terence Rattingan play updated our era , formerly shot in 1951 . Classic play updated to modern times , it's worth watching for extraordinary performances from British all-star-cast and marvelous ambiances . Forced to retire from an English public school a disliked professor named Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney) must confront his utter failures as a teacher , a husband , and a man . The lonely unemotional classics instructor realizes his flops , being cuckolded by a colleague and denied a deserved pension by the penurious headmaster (Michael Gambon) . Although he began his career eighteen years earlier as a brilliant young scholar, he has withdrawn into the stiff rigidity of school rules and regimentation , now his professional humiliation and loveless existence have give him a defensive armour of coldness . How this armour is pierced makes for dramatic entertainment . While facing a bleak financial future and a disintegrating marriage , his cold-blooded wife (Greta Scacchi) into an affair with another teacher (Matthew Modine), but the kindness of one of his students rekindles his humanity . A towering portrait of a wasted life about an out-of-touch teacher who has distanced himself from all human emotion . It contains super works , thought-provoking drama and magnificent settings , though turns out to be slow-moving . Wonderful performance by Albert Finney as a stuffy professor of Classical Greek at an English public school who is disliked by his students . Awesome Greta Scacchi as his bitchy , faithless spouse and good acting by Matthew Modine as her Science-master lover and Julian Sands as a language teacher . In addition , Ben Silverston , Maryam D'Abo , Jim Sturgess , Oliver Milburn and special mention to Michael Gambon as the headmaster . Colour cinematography is awesome , it was splendidly photographed by Jean Francois Robin . Emotive as well as sensitive musical score by Mark Isham . Although the film is pretty good results to be inferior by using strong language and other reasons than classic version (1951) directed by Anthony Asquith and starred by Michael Redgrave as the hapless and unpopular schoolmaster , Jean Kent as the unfaithful wife , Nigel Patrick and Bill Travers . The motion picture was well directed by Mike Figgis , a good British filmmaker . He is an expert on dramas as &uml;Time code&uml;, &uml;The loss of sexual innocence&uml;, &uml;One night stand&uml; and Thillers as &uml;Liebestraum&uml; and &uml;Stormy Monday&uml;. &uml;Browning version&uml; is considered to be one of his best films . Better than average . Worthwhile seeing .

    A movie about coming to terms with a life that didn't turn out, at you thought it would, about the importance of little things, when the structure itself is crumbling. I don't know exactly what it was about this movie but it just hit me, where i live. I cried my eyes out, and it colored my emotions for weeks after-wards. It deals with most of the issues that an adult is faced with; marriage, work relations, personal identity, etc., from the viewpoint of an aging teacher, who does what he does, except it isn't really working, as he thought would. Social acceptance and respect is missing, his marriage is on the rocks. In a way he is like a mundane Horatio on the bridge, who keeps fighting, knowing all too well, that the fight is lost, hoping perhaps beyond hope, that one small victory is possible.

    1bilbo seems confused. The original is set in a public school (not a grammar school) and there is therefore a subliminal gay message in the pedagogue/pupil relationship (Playwright, director, and lead were all gay/bi) but also the resolution (arguably) of the cruel wife being abandoned by her lover in favour of manly friendship. Having been to a public school (in the 70s) I can also say that the study of Classics inevitably meant one became aware of homosexuality in a way that didn't happen with other subjects (Greeks, Romans, let it all hang loose and all that). I presume this is why 1bilbo favours the original as a paean to old-fashioned public school values. I don't like remakes and haven't seen this one, but the one thing of which I am certain is that Rattigan did not mean his play to be seen as a critique of widening of the education system to all classes (or alternatively the supremacy of private education). I am equally certain that 1bilbo has no idea of whether the comprehensive system has provided better or worse educated people as he (I am pretty certain he is a he) has never looked this up. What I am sure he cannot argue with is that having a large proportion of the country considering themselves rejects at 11 and being sent to sub-standard secondary moderns that didn't even teach the same exams (the almost worthless CSE anyone?) is not a good education system.

    The original "Browning Version", with Michael Redgrave, was note-perfect. This remake suffers in comparison. The main problem is that the Britain which was depicted in the original no longer exists. It was a Britain of sublimated emotions and understatement. The Britain of today - in which this version is set - is a much cruder and more obvious sort of place. Unfortunately the film makers tried to blend the two and it doesn't really work. One example: the scene where the kids play a prank on the school bully. It wasn't in the original and it adds nothing to this version. It just jerks the viewer unpleasantly into the present when the movie should be trying to keep him in the quiet, more subtle and more interesting atmosphere it had succeeded in creating at other times. On a positive note, the acting is generally very good, especially by Albert Finney as Crocker-Harris. Even though he is brilliant, he is at times misused. At one point, Crocker-Harris is moved to tears by the gift from Taplow, his most enthusiastic student, and the only one it seems who will miss him when he leaves the school. Finney's acting is fine. He plays the emotion well. The trouble is that the viewer is concentrating on evaluating just how well Finney is performing, rather than actually feeling the emotion. The correct way to direct this would have been to intimate briefly that Crocker-Harris is overcome by emotion but then have him turn away and perhaps have the camera pull back, is if it was embarrassed to be a witness to such a thing. In our imaginations we would have created the scene and would not have been kept emotionally distant from it. This film could have been a masterpiece if all the discordant, modern elements had been discarded and it had concentrated on presenting its theme in a unified, coherent voice.

    This was an unexpected jewel of a movie. If you like movies such as "Remains of the Day," you will enjoy this one. Against the backdrop of a traditional boys school in the English countryside, a teacher who is being forced out examines his life. This movie is well-done across the board--the rich if spare script (perfect), the cinematography, a well-integrated score, all perfectly paced. This movie and the characters in it have layers. The acting by Albert Finney and Greta Sacchi is masterful (Michael Gabon is good, too). All that, and it has an honest ending. This movie had my rapt attention from the opening scene, and I am certain to watch it again.

    The cast of the recently updated "The Browning Version" based on a play by the late Sir Terence Rattigan includes Albert Finney, Sir Michael Gambon, Greta Scacchi, and American actor, Matthew Modine. The film is first rate in art direction, costumes, and sets. The film's adaptation from the play is loosely based. Albert Finney deserved an Oscar nomination for playing Andrew Crocker Foster, a retiring Classics instructor at a private boys' school in England. His wife, Laura, is unhappy and carrying on with Modine's character, a science instructor. The scenes with Finney and the boy playing Taplow are unforgettable and probably the finest. This film is a quiet gem and highly underrated. It should be considered a classic because it's well done without over-doing it with theatrics. The film's subtle and goes by pretty fast as well.

    This is remake of "The Browning Version", great movie of Anthony Asquith. Here Michael Redgrave is replaced with one of my favorite British actors, Albert Finney. Finney plays Andrew Crocker-Harris, teacher of classic languages in a British prep school. He's disliked from students, his colleagues and his younger wife is being unfaithful to him. The only boy who likes Crocker-Harris is Taplow and they have special relationship that culminates with Taplow's gift that makes Crocker-Harris cry, in one of my favorite scenes of this movie. I also must add, that beside Finney, there is very good performance of Greta Scacchi as his wife. So why to watch this movie? Because of Albert Finney's tutoring skills!!! He gives hour and half of acting lesson to us all. Thank you Mr. Finney, you are a true legend.

    An excellent acting job by Albert Finney carries this movie to a higher level than its script. Supplemented by good jobs by Greta Scacci and Mathew Modine, Finney minimalistically conveys the potent points of his character's regrets, fears, and passions. A terror to his students, Crocker-Harris allows himself to be dominated and humiliated by the school, the system, and the loveless marriage he is in. Mathew Modine, inserted apparently for young appeal, does his best with his character's sympathy for his older colleague, whom he has cuckolded. Scacci does her best with the faithless wife who enjoys twisting the knife in her hapless, though outwardly strong, husband. Only eight of a possible ten stars due to the slight letdown of the teacher's parting speech, and the abruptness of the ending.

    I got this out one wet Sunday afternoon hoping for an inspirational school drama along the lines of "To sir with love" or "Dead poets society"-- something to moisten my eyes and make me think anything was possible. Boy was I wrong -- this muddling drama, which covers the last days of an old masters career at an English public school, was depressing from beginning to end. As each element of the masters tragic life was revealed to me, I kept wondering when the turn-around point would be. Surely this entire movie was not just going to be the telling of the sad life of an uninteresting man and an ineffective teacher -- surely there would be some rising climax to contrast the woe. But no! For the final speech scene which I hung on for, the master turned out the most embarrassing self pitying display I have ever seen on film -- something like my grandfather when he's had too many drinks at Christmas. Of course, the teachers and students dutifully applauded, shouted and stomped (to indicate to the viewer that this was indeed the climax) but I was just thought he was an old fool. There were admittedly some nice insights into human behavior and relationships and some good English upper-class mocking (tea and cricket chaps!) but the other characters never seemed to develop as if to save room for the central story. Unfortunately, the sad old teacher didn't developed beyond self-pity throughout the entire movie, leaving me with the definite impression that he "..got what he deserved, no more and certainly no less".

    Albert Finney and Greta Scacchi have given a fabulous performance. Indeed this is a rare gem in cinema. I give this 9 out of 10. The script is tight, the music score good and the performances are amazing. Its a simple story of a school teacher who is forced to retire. He finds no comfort in his retirement as he is denied his pension and there is absolutely no one in the school who is sad to see him go. Living with an unfaithful life, this school teacher lives a lonely life. Never to bow down to anyone and nor letting anyone sympathise with him, he portrays a classic and rare case of a strong human being. As i say this, it was sad to see him break down when a kid showers him a rare gift of love. If this movie does not touch your soul or move you, then you truly belong to the cold hearted. Keep a handkerchief ready. Please watch this movie. It is a masterpiece .
