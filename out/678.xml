    Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency Management(OEM) who is contacted by Dr. Amy Barnes(Anne Heche) who is concerned that Earth tremors will lead to an underground eruption of a volcano, as temperatures within are increasing. He scoffs, but she is proved right when fireballs emerge from the volcanic eruption, and Los Angeles is threatened by a moving wall of lava. How can the team stop it, and save the city? Slickly made but implausible film might have been better served moving the location to Hawaii, where it might be believable. Anne Heche shines, but other characters are dumb or superfluous, though this still remains a semi-watchable popcorn film, but little more.

    I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow. Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times. It's really in the middle and for 104 minutes, it's action packed enough to enjoy for a Disaster Flick kind of mood. Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes. Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget. That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.

    Volcano eruptions! Molten rocks! Lava! Magma blasts! Poison gas! Scolding hot steam! Intense heat! Extreme temperatures! Seismic activity! Earthquakes! Tommy Lee Jones! Widespread panic! Fire! Burning vehicles! Fireballs! Terror! Explosions! Building collapses! More explosions! Total city destruction! Complete chaos! Anne Heche! Smoke and ashes! What's not to love! I didn't know movies about volcanoes could be so awesome, and 1997 gave us two, Volcano as well as Dante's Peak. Volcano is so good and well-liked, by me at the least. Volcano is an instant hit in my book! A blockbuster about volcanoes is such a great type for a movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche do great jobs as Mike Roark and Dr. Amy Barnes. Heche and Jones make a great team, and you couldn't ask for two better people to play the parts. Roark is heroic, and a family man, Jones fits the build well. Heche is always pleasing, and she really knows how to lay herself out on the line for the part. Volcano is overblown to an extent, but in a watchable way. It's good theater with good effects. It's a very recommended suspenseful adventure. In a very broad sense, Volcano is one of my favorite movies. I'm using the terms 'very broad' here. Loved it!

    This is one of my favorite disaster movies of all time,, maybe that's because the movie doesn't give you 200 characters to follow and care about like most disaster flicks,, god I hate that. in this one it's our main character,, his teen princess, his job,, and maybe 5 other characters.. that 's it.. lot's of stuff in this movie,, fireballs from the La Brea Tar Pits.. Anne Heche did really well in the film also, I liked the constant bickering from both of those characters.. Don Cheadle stealed the show for me , he was really funny, and knew what he was doing.. watching the lava flow down the streets.. the lava bombs.. the city workers getting toasted in the tunnel.. everything in this picture was really vivid,, think about it,, it's on a fault line.. so probably yet highly unlikely,, Volcano could actually happen in real life given the right set of circumstances,, which oddly enough are presented for us in the movie.. so excellent movie to watch,, recommend to anyone that just wants to be blow away by action.

    Usually when I want to see a movie, I don't read too much about in beforehand, just the main plot. I want the story to unfold me - hopefully with positive response, or if necessary; with total disappointment or mediocrity. Overall I try to ignore the professional critics - some may praise the same movie as someone else is beating it down the gutter. Those critiques have no meaning for me, it's me as a viewer that counts. Back to this movie, "Volcano" has some exiting scenes, but unfortunately the clich&eacute;s are lined up, and concerning small and big heroes, it is quite unbelievable how many clich&eacute;s they can make room for in one tiny story. for good and bad, it's not much of a story either; even skilled actors couldn't impress, but I give one little point for Anne Heche in this case. The special effects were mostly well done, but some of them were directly pathetic to watch. In any case, after the end credits, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great.

    This movie has a lot of problems. Bad acting, boring characters, impossible situations and it's hard to take the movie seriously when the characters do so many stupid things. A guy who melts from his feet up to his head without toppling over in the lava. Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie. Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later. I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for. In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.

    Take a macho protagonist - in this case a boss of emergency services. Give him a personal problem - care of a teen daughter who doesn't want to be there. Let's have a natural disaster - how about a volcano sprouting in the middle of Los Angeles. Factor in a spunky female lead and a doom-mongering scientist who gives early warning but gets ignored (and cut the budget by having them be the same person). Then have an effects-laden final hour in which things get worse and worse until our hero saves the day. You've seen the formula before - well, here it is again. Tommy Lee Jones does gnarled man with a plan quite well, Anne Heche does spunky scientist quite well, the lava effects aren't bad, and the final effects of blowing up the building are not so good. Even so, it passes a couple of hours moderately well.

    The story is ridiculous, a volcano in the middle of L.A.? It's hard to believe and kind of hard to follow. The story starts out very strong, but descends into chaos as everything happens at once. A lot is going on and it's a jumble of impossible acts, which include stopping lava with a bus, a blown up building, and finally the sewers. At points it's more than just impossible, it's ridiculous! The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested. Volcano may not be a movie you run out and buy, but if it's on cable, Jones will definitely keep your attention and get you to watch it.

    In the city of Los Angeles, it is nice quiet and routine. Until an earthquake occurs. The director of the city's emergency management, Michael Roark believes that something is big is about to happen, so he finds a geologist named Amy Barnes to help him investigate. What they will realise that the earthquake is a sign of a volcano forming in the city. The volcano formed at the La Brea Tarpits. Now Roark has to use every resource in the city to stop the volcano from consuming Los Angeles... Okay, so the plausibility factor in this is stretched to it's very limits, and the script is downright hilarious. Bt one cannot deny the fun you have whilst watching this. Made in a time when anything Lee Jones was in was worth watching, Volcano is like one of those good old fashioned seventies disaster movies, minus the character input. You know from the start who will live and who will die, thanks to the persons stress levels. For example, the guy who is trying to quit smoking has the short end of the stick in death scenes. But all the cast are good, given the material they are using, and Lee Jones gives it that bit of class the film desperately needs. When the day is saved, there is a little message that goes along the lines of 'in the hour of need, we are all the same, despite creed, culture, or colour', thanks to a child pointing out the fact that everyone is covered in ash. It's better than Dante's Peak by a mile, and the dog survives, which makes a nice change. The tag-line should have been 'the coast is cheese on toast'.

    I liked the movie mainly due to Tommy Lee Jones. An array of any other actors would have made the rating smaller. It was an exciting movie, but at times it dragged. The plot lines were kind of thrown together with two emerging as the main focus points: saving the city and finding his daughter. There wasn't a lot of solid science to it...you're not going to stop a lava flow like that with firetrucks and helicopters. We won't go into the geology of it, but I was disappointed. I think the disaster movie boom as of lately was been interesting but pretty mediocre. It's just not realistic enough to scare anyone the way they should be in this type of film.

The plot lines were kind of thrown together with two emerging as the main focus points: saving the city and finding his daughter. There wasn't a lot of solid science to it...you're not going to stop a lava flow like that with firetrucks and helicopters. We won't go into the geology of it, but I was disappointed. I think the disaster movie boom as of lately was been interesting but pretty mediocre. It's just not realistic enough to scare anyone the way they should be in this type of film.

    Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency Management(OEM) who is contacted by Dr. Amy Barnes(Anne Heche) who is concerned that Earth tremors will lead to an underground eruption of a volcano, as temperatures within are increasing. He scoffs, but she is proved right when fireballs emerge from the volcanic eruption, and Los Angeles is threatened by a moving wall of lava. How can the team stop it, and save the city? Slickly made but implausible film might have been better served moving the location to Hawaii, where it might be believable. Anne Heche shines, but other characters are dumb or superfluous, though this still remains a semi-watchable popcorn film, but little more.

    I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow. Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times. It's really in the middle and for 104 minutes, it's action packed enough to enjoy for a Disaster Flick kind of mood. Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes. Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget. That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.

    Volcano eruptions! Molten rocks! Lava! Magma blasts! Poison gas! Scolding hot steam! Intense heat! Extreme temperatures! Seismic activity! Earthquakes! Tommy Lee Jones! Widespread panic! Fire! Burning vehicles! Fireballs! Terror! Explosions! Building collapses! More explosions! Total city destruction! Complete chaos! Anne Heche! Smoke and ashes! What's not to love! I didn't know movies about volcanoes could be so awesome, and 1997 gave us two, Volcano as well as Dante's Peak. Volcano is so good and well-liked, by me at the least. Volcano is an instant hit in my book! A blockbuster about volcanoes is such a great type for a movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche do great jobs as Mike Roark and Dr. Amy Barnes. Heche and Jones make a great team, and you couldn't ask for two better people to play the parts. Roark is heroic, and a family man, Jones fits the build well. Heche is always pleasing, and she really knows how to lay herself out on the line for the part. Volcano is overblown to an extent, but in a watchable way. It's good theater with good effects. It's a very recommended suspenseful adventure. In a very broad sense, Volcano is one of my favorite movies. I'm using the terms 'very broad' here. Loved it!

    This is one of my favorite disaster movies of all time,, maybe that's because the movie doesn't give you 200 characters to follow and care about like most disaster flicks,, god I hate that. in this one it's our main character,, his teen princess, his job,, and maybe 5 other characters.. that 's it.. lot's of stuff in this movie,, fireballs from the La Brea Tar Pits.. Anne Heche did really well in the film also, I liked the constant bickering from both of those characters.. Don Cheadle stealed the show for me , he was really funny, and knew what he was doing.. watching the lava flow down the streets.. the lava bombs.. the city workers getting toasted in the tunnel.. everything in this picture was really vivid,, think about it,, it's on a fault line.. so probably yet highly unlikely,, Volcano could actually happen in real life given the right set of circumstances,, which oddly enough are presented for us in the movie.. so excellent movie to watch,, recommend to anyone that just wants to be blow away by action.

    Usually when I want to see a movie, I don't read too much about in beforehand, just the main plot. I want the story to unfold me - hopefully with positive response, or if necessary; with total disappointment or mediocrity. Overall I try to ignore the professional critics - some may praise the same movie as someone else is beating it down the gutter. Those critiques have no meaning for me, it's me as a viewer that counts. Back to this movie, "Volcano" has some exiting scenes, but unfortunately the clich&eacute;s are lined up, and concerning small and big heroes, it is quite unbelievable how many clich&eacute;s they can make room for in one tiny story. for good and bad, it's not much of a story either; even skilled actors couldn't impress, but I give one little point for Anne Heche in this case. The special effects were mostly well done, but some of them were directly pathetic to watch. In any case, after the end credits, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great.

    This movie has a lot of problems. Bad acting, boring characters, impossible situations and it's hard to take the movie seriously when the characters do so many stupid things. A guy who melts from his feet up to his head without toppling over in the lava. Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie. Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later. I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for. In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.

    Take a macho protagonist - in this case a boss of emergency services. Give him a personal problem - care of a teen daughter who doesn't want to be there. Let's have a natural disaster - how about a volcano sprouting in the middle of Los Angeles. Factor in a spunky female lead and a doom-mongering scientist who gives early warning but gets ignored (and cut the budget by having them be the same person). Then have an effects-laden final hour in which things get worse and worse until our hero saves the day. You've seen the formula before - well, here it is again. Tommy Lee Jones does gnarled man with a plan quite well, Anne Heche does spunky scientist quite well, the lava effects aren't bad, and the final effects of blowing up the building are not so good. Even so, it passes a couple of hours moderately well.

    The story is ridiculous, a volcano in the middle of L.A.? It's hard to believe and kind of hard to follow. The story starts out very strong, but descends into chaos as everything happens at once. A lot is going on and it's a jumble of impossible acts, which include stopping lava with a bus, a blown up building, and finally the sewers. At points it's more than just impossible, it's ridiculous! The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested. Volcano may not be a movie you run out and buy, but if it's on cable, Jones will definitely keep your attention and get you to watch it.

    In the city of Los Angeles, it is nice quiet and routine. Until an earthquake occurs. The director of the city's emergency management, Michael Roark believes that something is big is about to happen, so he finds a geologist named Amy Barnes to help him investigate. What they will realise that the earthquake is a sign of a volcano forming in the city. The volcano formed at the La Brea Tarpits. Now Roark has to use every resource in the city to stop the volcano from consuming Los Angeles... Okay, so the plausibility factor in this is stretched to it's very limits, and the script is downright hilarious. Bt one cannot deny the fun you have whilst watching this. Made in a time when anything Lee Jones was in was worth watching, Volcano is like one of those good old fashioned seventies disaster movies, minus the character input. You know from the start who will live and who will die, thanks to the persons stress levels. For example, the guy who is trying to quit smoking has the short end of the stick in death scenes. But all the cast are good, given the material they are using, and Lee Jones gives it that bit of class the film desperately needs. When the day is saved, there is a little message that goes along the lines of 'in the hour of need, we are all the same, despite creed, culture, or colour', thanks to a child pointing out the fact that everyone is covered in ash. It's better than Dante's Peak by a mile, and the dog survives, which makes a nice change. The tag-line should have been 'the coast is cheese on toast'.

Anne Heche shines, but other characters are dumb or superfluous, though this still remains a semi-watchable popcorn film, but little more.

    I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow. Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times. It's really in the middle and for 104 minutes, it's action packed enough to enjoy for a Disaster Flick kind of mood. Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes. Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget. That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.

    Volcano eruptions! Molten rocks! Lava! Magma blasts! Poison gas! Scolding hot steam! Intense heat! Extreme temperatures! Seismic activity! Earthquakes! Tommy Lee Jones! Widespread panic! Fire! Burning vehicles! Fireballs! Terror! Explosions! Building collapses! More explosions! Total city destruction! Complete chaos! Anne Heche! Smoke and ashes! What's not to love! I didn't know movies about volcanoes could be so awesome, and 1997 gave us two, Volcano as well as Dante's Peak. Volcano is so good and well-liked, by me at the least. Volcano is an instant hit in my book! A blockbuster about volcanoes is such a great type for a movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche do great jobs as Mike Roark and Dr. Amy Barnes. Heche and Jones make a great team, and you couldn't ask for two better people to play the parts. Roark is heroic, and a family man, Jones fits the build well. Heche is always pleasing, and she really knows how to lay herself out on the line for the part. Volcano is overblown to an extent, but in a watchable way. It's good theater with good effects. It's a very recommended suspenseful adventure. In a very broad sense, Volcano is one of my favorite movies. I'm using the terms 'very broad' here. Loved it!

    This is one of my favorite disaster movies of all time,, maybe that's because the movie doesn't give you 200 characters to follow and care about like most disaster flicks,, god I hate that. in this one it's our main character,, his teen princess, his job,, and maybe 5 other characters.. that 's it.. lot's of stuff in this movie,, fireballs from the La Brea Tar Pits.. Anne Heche did really well in the film also, I liked the constant bickering from both of those characters.. Don Cheadle stealed the show for me , he was really funny, and knew what he was doing.. watching the lava flow down the streets.. the lava bombs.. the city workers getting toasted in the tunnel.. everything in this picture was really vivid,, think about it,, it's on a fault line.. so probably yet highly unlikely,, Volcano could actually happen in real life given the right set of circumstances,, which oddly enough are presented for us in the movie.. so excellent movie to watch,, recommend to anyone that just wants to be blow away by action.

    Usually when I want to see a movie, I don't read too much about in beforehand, just the main plot. I want the story to unfold me - hopefully with positive response, or if necessary; with total disappointment or mediocrity. Overall I try to ignore the professional critics - some may praise the same movie as someone else is beating it down the gutter. Those critiques have no meaning for me, it's me as a viewer that counts. Back to this movie, "Volcano" has some exiting scenes, but unfortunately the clich&eacute;s are lined up, and concerning small and big heroes, it is quite unbelievable how many clich&eacute;s they can make room for in one tiny story. for good and bad, it's not much of a story either; even skilled actors couldn't impress, but I give one little point for Anne Heche in this case. The special effects were mostly well done, but some of them were directly pathetic to watch. In any case, after the end credits, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great.

    This movie has a lot of problems. Bad acting, boring characters, impossible situations and it's hard to take the movie seriously when the characters do so many stupid things. A guy who melts from his feet up to his head without toppling over in the lava. Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie. Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later. I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for. In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.

    Take a macho protagonist - in this case a boss of emergency services. Give him a personal problem - care of a teen daughter who doesn't want to be there. Let's have a natural disaster - how about a volcano sprouting in the middle of Los Angeles. Factor in a spunky female lead and a doom-mongering scientist who gives early warning but gets ignored (and cut the budget by having them be the same person). Then have an effects-laden final hour in which things get worse and worse until our hero saves the day. You've seen the formula before - well, here it is again. Tommy Lee Jones does gnarled man with a plan quite well, Anne Heche does spunky scientist quite well, the lava effects aren't bad, and the final effects of blowing up the building are not so good. Even so, it passes a couple of hours moderately well.

    The story is ridiculous, a volcano in the middle of L.A.? It's hard to believe and kind of hard to follow. The story starts out very strong, but descends into chaos as everything happens at once. A lot is going on and it's a jumble of impossible acts, which include stopping lava with a bus, a blown up building, and finally the sewers. At points it's more than just impossible, it's ridiculous! The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested. Volcano may not be a movie you run out and buy, but if it's on cable, Jones will definitely keep your attention and get you to watch it.

    In the city of Los Angeles, it is nice quiet and routine. Until an earthquake occurs. The director of the city's emergency management, Michael Roark believes that something is big is about to happen, so he finds a geologist named Amy Barnes to help him investigate. What they will realise that the earthquake is a sign of a volcano forming in the city. The volcano formed at the La Brea Tarpits. Now Roark has to use every resource in the city to stop the volcano from consuming Los Angeles... Okay, so the plausibility factor in this is stretched to it's very limits, and the script is downright hilarious. Bt one cannot deny the fun you have whilst watching this. Made in a time when anything Lee Jones was in was worth watching, Volcano is like one of those good old fashioned seventies disaster movies, minus the character input. You know from the start who will live and who will die, thanks to the persons stress levels. For example, the guy who is trying to quit smoking has the short end of the stick in death scenes. But all the cast are good, given the material they are using, and Lee Jones gives it that bit of class the film desperately needs. When the day is saved, there is a little message that goes along the lines of 'in the hour of need, we are all the same, despite creed, culture, or colour', thanks to a child pointing out the fact that everyone is covered in ash. It's better than Dante's Peak by a mile, and the dog survives, which makes a nice change. The tag-line should have been 'the coast is cheese on toast'.

    I liked the movie mainly due to Tommy Lee Jones. An array of any other actors would have made the rating smaller. It was an exciting movie, but at times it dragged. The plot lines were kind of thrown together with two emerging as the main focus points: saving the city and finding his daughter. There wasn't a lot of solid science to it...you're not going to stop a lava flow like that with firetrucks and helicopters. We won't go into the geology of it, but I was disappointed. I think the disaster movie boom as of lately was been interesting but pretty mediocre. It's just not realistic enough to scare anyone the way they should be in this type of film.

    Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency Management(OEM) who is contacted by Dr. Amy Barnes(Anne Heche) who is concerned that Earth tremors will lead to an underground eruption of a volcano, as temperatures within are increasing. He scoffs, but she is proved right when fireballs emerge from the volcanic eruption, and Los Angeles is threatened by a moving wall of lava. How can the team stop it, and save the city? Slickly made but implausible film might have been better served moving the location to Hawaii, where it might be believable.

Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes. Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget. That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.

    Volcano eruptions! Molten rocks! Lava! Magma blasts! Poison gas! Scolding hot steam! Intense heat! Extreme temperatures! Seismic activity! Earthquakes! Tommy Lee Jones! Widespread panic! Fire! Burning vehicles! Fireballs! Terror! Explosions! Building collapses! More explosions! Total city destruction! Complete chaos! Anne Heche! Smoke and ashes! What's not to love! I didn't know movies about volcanoes could be so awesome, and 1997 gave us two, Volcano as well as Dante's Peak. Volcano is so good and well-liked, by me at the least. Volcano is an instant hit in my book! A blockbuster about volcanoes is such a great type for a movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche do great jobs as Mike Roark and Dr. Amy Barnes. Heche and Jones make a great team, and you couldn't ask for two better people to play the parts. Roark is heroic, and a family man, Jones fits the build well. Heche is always pleasing, and she really knows how to lay herself out on the line for the part. Volcano is overblown to an extent, but in a watchable way. It's good theater with good effects. It's a very recommended suspenseful adventure. In a very broad sense, Volcano is one of my favorite movies. I'm using the terms 'very broad' here. Loved it!

    This is one of my favorite disaster movies of all time,, maybe that's because the movie doesn't give you 200 characters to follow and care about like most disaster flicks,, god I hate that. in this one it's our main character,, his teen princess, his job,, and maybe 5 other characters.. that 's it.. lot's of stuff in this movie,, fireballs from the La Brea Tar Pits.. Anne Heche did really well in the film also, I liked the constant bickering from both of those characters.. Don Cheadle stealed the show for me , he was really funny, and knew what he was doing.. watching the lava flow down the streets.. the lava bombs.. the city workers getting toasted in the tunnel.. everything in this picture was really vivid,, think about it,, it's on a fault line.. so probably yet highly unlikely,, Volcano could actually happen in real life given the right set of circumstances,, which oddly enough are presented for us in the movie.. so excellent movie to watch,, recommend to anyone that just wants to be blow away by action.

    Usually when I want to see a movie, I don't read too much about in beforehand, just the main plot. I want the story to unfold me - hopefully with positive response, or if necessary; with total disappointment or mediocrity. Overall I try to ignore the professional critics - some may praise the same movie as someone else is beating it down the gutter. Those critiques have no meaning for me, it's me as a viewer that counts. Back to this movie, "Volcano" has some exiting scenes, but unfortunately the clich&eacute;s are lined up, and concerning small and big heroes, it is quite unbelievable how many clich&eacute;s they can make room for in one tiny story. for good and bad, it's not much of a story either; even skilled actors couldn't impress, but I give one little point for Anne Heche in this case. The special effects were mostly well done, but some of them were directly pathetic to watch. In any case, after the end credits, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great.

    This movie has a lot of problems. Bad acting, boring characters, impossible situations and it's hard to take the movie seriously when the characters do so many stupid things. A guy who melts from his feet up to his head without toppling over in the lava. Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie. Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later. I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for. In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.

    Take a macho protagonist - in this case a boss of emergency services. Give him a personal problem - care of a teen daughter who doesn't want to be there. Let's have a natural disaster - how about a volcano sprouting in the middle of Los Angeles. Factor in a spunky female lead and a doom-mongering scientist who gives early warning but gets ignored (and cut the budget by having them be the same person). Then have an effects-laden final hour in which things get worse and worse until our hero saves the day. You've seen the formula before - well, here it is again. Tommy Lee Jones does gnarled man with a plan quite well, Anne Heche does spunky scientist quite well, the lava effects aren't bad, and the final effects of blowing up the building are not so good. Even so, it passes a couple of hours moderately well.

    The story is ridiculous, a volcano in the middle of L.A.? It's hard to believe and kind of hard to follow. The story starts out very strong, but descends into chaos as everything happens at once. A lot is going on and it's a jumble of impossible acts, which include stopping lava with a bus, a blown up building, and finally the sewers. At points it's more than just impossible, it's ridiculous! The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested. Volcano may not be a movie you run out and buy, but if it's on cable, Jones will definitely keep your attention and get you to watch it.

    In the city of Los Angeles, it is nice quiet and routine. Until an earthquake occurs. The director of the city's emergency management, Michael Roark believes that something is big is about to happen, so he finds a geologist named Amy Barnes to help him investigate. What they will realise that the earthquake is a sign of a volcano forming in the city. The volcano formed at the La Brea Tarpits. Now Roark has to use every resource in the city to stop the volcano from consuming Los Angeles... Okay, so the plausibility factor in this is stretched to it's very limits, and the script is downright hilarious. Bt one cannot deny the fun you have whilst watching this. Made in a time when anything Lee Jones was in was worth watching, Volcano is like one of those good old fashioned seventies disaster movies, minus the character input. You know from the start who will live and who will die, thanks to the persons stress levels. For example, the guy who is trying to quit smoking has the short end of the stick in death scenes. But all the cast are good, given the material they are using, and Lee Jones gives it that bit of class the film desperately needs. When the day is saved, there is a little message that goes along the lines of 'in the hour of need, we are all the same, despite creed, culture, or colour', thanks to a child pointing out the fact that everyone is covered in ash. It's better than Dante's Peak by a mile, and the dog survives, which makes a nice change. The tag-line should have been 'the coast is cheese on toast'.

    I liked the movie mainly due to Tommy Lee Jones. An array of any other actors would have made the rating smaller. It was an exciting movie, but at times it dragged. The plot lines were kind of thrown together with two emerging as the main focus points: saving the city and finding his daughter. There wasn't a lot of solid science to it...you're not going to stop a lava flow like that with firetrucks and helicopters. We won't go into the geology of it, but I was disappointed. I think the disaster movie boom as of lately was been interesting but pretty mediocre. It's just not realistic enough to scare anyone the way they should be in this type of film.

    Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency Management(OEM) who is contacted by Dr. Amy Barnes(Anne Heche) who is concerned that Earth tremors will lead to an underground eruption of a volcano, as temperatures within are increasing. He scoffs, but she is proved right when fireballs emerge from the volcanic eruption, and Los Angeles is threatened by a moving wall of lava. How can the team stop it, and save the city? Slickly made but implausible film might have been better served moving the location to Hawaii, where it might be believable. Anne Heche shines, but other characters are dumb or superfluous, though this still remains a semi-watchable popcorn film, but little more.

    I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow. Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times.

    Volcano eruptions! Molten rocks! Lava! Magma blasts! Poison gas! Scolding hot steam! Intense heat! Extreme temperatures! Seismic activity! Earthquakes! Tommy Lee Jones! Widespread panic! Fire! Burning vehicles! Fireballs! Terror! Explosions! Building collapses! More explosions! Total city destruction! Complete chaos! Anne Heche! Smoke and ashes! What's not to love! I didn't know movies about volcanoes could be so awesome, and 1997 gave us two, Volcano as well as Dante's Peak. Volcano is so good and well-liked, by me at the least. Volcano is an instant hit in my book! A blockbuster about volcanoes is such a great type for a movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche do great jobs as Mike Roark and Dr. Amy Barnes. Heche and Jones make a great team, and you couldn't ask for two better people to play the parts. Roark is heroic, and a family man, Jones fits the build well. Heche is always pleasing, and she really knows how to lay herself out on the line for the part. Volcano is overblown to an extent, but in a watchable way. It's good theater with good effects. It's a very recommended suspenseful adventure. In a very broad sense, Volcano is one of my favorite movies. I'm using the terms 'very broad' here. Loved it!

    This is one of my favorite disaster movies of all time,, maybe that's because the movie doesn't give you 200 characters to follow and care about like most disaster flicks,, god I hate that. in this one it's our main character,, his teen princess, his job,, and maybe 5 other characters.. that 's it.. lot's of stuff in this movie,, fireballs from the La Brea Tar Pits.. Anne Heche did really well in the film also, I liked the constant bickering from both of those characters.. Don Cheadle stealed the show for me , he was really funny, and knew what he was doing.. watching the lava flow down the streets.. the lava bombs.. the city workers getting toasted in the tunnel.. everything in this picture was really vivid,, think about it,, it's on a fault line.. so probably yet highly unlikely,, Volcano could actually happen in real life given the right set of circumstances,, which oddly enough are presented for us in the movie.. so excellent movie to watch,, recommend to anyone that just wants to be blow away by action.

    Usually when I want to see a movie, I don't read too much about in beforehand, just the main plot. I want the story to unfold me - hopefully with positive response, or if necessary; with total disappointment or mediocrity. Overall I try to ignore the professional critics - some may praise the same movie as someone else is beating it down the gutter. Those critiques have no meaning for me, it's me as a viewer that counts. Back to this movie, "Volcano" has some exiting scenes, but unfortunately the clich&eacute;s are lined up, and concerning small and big heroes, it is quite unbelievable how many clich&eacute;s they can make room for in one tiny story. for good and bad, it's not much of a story either; even skilled actors couldn't impress, but I give one little point for Anne Heche in this case. The special effects were mostly well done, but some of them were directly pathetic to watch. In any case, after the end credits, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great.

    This movie has a lot of problems. Bad acting, boring characters, impossible situations and it's hard to take the movie seriously when the characters do so many stupid things. A guy who melts from his feet up to his head without toppling over in the lava. Tommy Lee Jones and the woman's shoes are smoking from the heat of the lava beneath them, yet the shoes themselves seems to not remain hot after they are dropped on solid ground. Seismologists who thinks it's a brilliant idea to go alone at 4 AM to investigate a place where several workers have boiled to death from heat. One of said seismologists who thinks it's smart to sit right above a crack in the ground where the steam has come from. Blowing up a huge building in 20 minutes. Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense, I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie. Kelly (Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie) is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15, but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward, needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy, spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope, she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car, pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh, but at the hospital, she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later. I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident, yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for. In conclusion, the movie is very stupid, but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times, there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.

    Take a macho protagonist - in this case a boss of emergency services. Give him a personal problem - care of a teen daughter who doesn't want to be there. Let's have a natural disaster - how about a volcano sprouting in the middle of Los Angeles. Factor in a spunky female lead and a doom-mongering scientist who gives early warning but gets ignored (and cut the budget by having them be the same person). Then have an effects-laden final hour in which things get worse and worse until our hero saves the day. You've seen the formula before - well, here it is again. Tommy Lee Jones does gnarled man with a plan quite well, Anne Heche does spunky scientist quite well, the lava effects aren't bad, and the final effects of blowing up the building are not so good. Even so, it passes a couple of hours moderately well.

    The story is ridiculous, a volcano in the middle of L.A.? It's hard to believe and kind of hard to follow. The story starts out very strong, but descends into chaos as everything happens at once. A lot is going on and it's a jumble of impossible acts, which include stopping lava with a bus, a blown up building, and finally the sewers. At points it's more than just impossible, it's ridiculous! The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested. Volcano may not be a movie you run out and buy, but if it's on cable, Jones will definitely keep your attention and get you to watch it.

    In the city of Los Angeles, it is nice quiet and routine. Until an earthquake occurs. The director of the city's emergency management, Michael Roark believes that something is big is about to happen, so he finds a geologist named Amy Barnes to help him investigate. What they will realise that the earthquake is a sign of a volcano forming in the city. The volcano formed at the La Brea Tarpits. Now Roark has to use every resource in the city to stop the volcano from consuming Los Angeles... Okay, so the plausibility factor in this is stretched to it's very limits, and the script is downright hilarious. Bt one cannot deny the fun you have whilst watching this. Made in a time when anything Lee Jones was in was worth watching, Volcano is like one of those good old fashioned seventies disaster movies, minus the character input. You know from the start who will live and who will die, thanks to the persons stress levels. For example, the guy who is trying to quit smoking has the short end of the stick in death scenes. But all the cast are good, given the material they are using, and Lee Jones gives it that bit of class the film desperately needs. When the day is saved, there is a little message that goes along the lines of 'in the hour of need, we are all the same, despite creed, culture, or colour', thanks to a child pointing out the fact that everyone is covered in ash. It's better than Dante's Peak by a mile, and the dog survives, which makes a nice change. The tag-line should have been 'the coast is cheese on toast'.

    I liked the movie mainly due to Tommy Lee Jones. An array of any other actors would have made the rating smaller. It was an exciting movie, but at times it dragged. The plot lines were kind of thrown together with two emerging as the main focus points: saving the city and finding his daughter. There wasn't a lot of solid science to it...you're not going to stop a lava flow like that with firetrucks and helicopters. We won't go into the geology of it, but I was disappointed. I think the disaster movie boom as of lately was been interesting but pretty mediocre. It's just not realistic enough to scare anyone the way they should be in this type of film.

    Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency Management(OEM) who is contacted by Dr. Amy Barnes(Anne Heche) who is concerned that Earth tremors will lead to an underground eruption of a volcano, as temperatures within are increasing. He scoffs, but she is proved right when fireballs emerge from the volcanic eruption, and Los Angeles is threatened by a moving wall of lava. How can the team stop it, and save the city? Slickly made but implausible film might have been better served moving the location to Hawaii, where it might be believable. Anne Heche shines, but other characters are dumb or superfluous, though this still remains a semi-watchable popcorn film, but little more.

    I'm a sucker for Disaster Flicks, like the previous volcano movie in 1997, Dante's Peak or 1996's Twister. But, when the idea doesn't come from the Syfy Channel and yet, it sure as heck feels like it did, it's kinda hard to swallow. Volcano, still, is enjoyable. Thanks to the never-stopping charisma of Tommy Lee Jones and adorable (at the time) Anne Heche. It's not great and it's not terrible. It's not plausible and certainly improbable at times. It's really in the middle and for 104 minutes, it's action packed enough to enjoy for a Disaster Flick kind of mood. Basically, devoted father and director of the city's emergency management, Mike (Jones) is trying to comprehend what he sees, but doesn't believe: a volcano under the L.A. city erupts into the city. With help from geologist Amy (Heche,) they attempt to divert lava from homes, buildings and oddly-thrown-in racial conflicts. I'm guessing they were trying hard to be the next Lethal Weapon that had a never-ending supply of "positive messages" and subliminal causes. Their plan? To get the lava to the ocean and save property and art. Oh, lives, too, but mainly real estate and possessions. Will it would? Would it work? No and no. But, then, again you're dealing with a prime Syfy movie-of-the-weekwith a budget. That said, it's fun, it's fluff, it can't possibly be taken seriously  so don't try and if you like Jones, even the slightest, you'll love him here.
