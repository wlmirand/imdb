    The plot lasts 24 hours. The location is limited to a residential apartment building and its courtyard in the middle. All sorts of characters, with their patterns, habits, lives, wants. Ambience is early sixties Rome, probably the Piazza Mazzini neighborhood. The cars, clothing, expressions, music, radio themes are all authentically duplicated (quite impressive feat). The residential settings reminds the one in "Una Giornata Particolare". The title of the movie is the name of a popular song in the early sixties in Italy. Very impressive first feature film. Great attention to detail. Very nice camera movement as it follows the bunch of kids on the rooftop terrace through the linens drying on the sun and flapping to the wind. There are some small cultural assumptions that are maybe understood only by folks that lived in Rome in those years that outside audiences may not understand (and that is a kisk of any motion picture that tries to be less generic and more specialized in a very specific theme), but it is done a well balanced way that still makes this film most enjoyable to all audiences.
