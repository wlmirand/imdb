    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

    I understand fully the historic importance of this movie, since it was a very early example of Alfred Hitchcock's work in the suspense genre. That alone qualifies it to be considered a classic. In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more. Some elements of the story mystified me and as a result I found myself losing focus from time to time. The scenes in the Scottish man's house seemed unnecessary. The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    Rating: **** out of 4. The great Alfred Hitchcock, who would later go on with grander projects with enough money to back him up, started with simpler, humbler efforts like this classic British spy thriller. It's obviously done in a low budget, with a feel to it that still embraces the silent era. But with Hitchcock's born talent, THE 39 STEPS is an unqualified success and still is one of the best in his career. Many might see it as a prototype for his later thrillers like SABOTEUR and the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but having seen it, it deserves to be seen in its own right. Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a typically pedestrian man who finds himself in a wave of conspiracy and murder when he meets and escorts a random woman (Lucie Mannheim) who is actually being pursued by enemy spies for a secret which she possesses. Now on the run himself, Hannay picks up a blonde stranger named Pamela (Madeline Caroll) and grows an affection for her while being pursued by enemy spies. There are a number of respectable (if dated) set-pieces here worthy of attention, and the funny and romantic leads may the journey worthwhile. The ending was great, especially when you realize that what all these characters, the good guys and the bad guys, are making such a fuss about doesn't even really matter to you. This is the birth of the classic Hitchcock trait; The MacGuffin. THE 39 STEPS is a classic, and a worthy curio for you movie buffs out there.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    Rating: **** out of 4. The great Alfred Hitchcock, who would later go on with grander projects with enough money to back him up, started with simpler, humbler efforts like this classic British spy thriller. It's obviously done in a low budget, with a feel to it that still embraces the silent era. But with Hitchcock's born talent, THE 39 STEPS is an unqualified success and still is one of the best in his career. Many might see it as a prototype for his later thrillers like SABOTEUR and the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but having seen it, it deserves to be seen in its own right. Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a typically pedestrian man who finds himself in a wave of conspiracy and murder when he meets and escorts a random woman (Lucie Mannheim) who is actually being pursued by enemy spies for a secret which she possesses. Now on the run himself, Hannay picks up a blonde stranger named Pamela (Madeline Caroll) and grows an affection for her while being pursued by enemy spies. There are a number of respectable (if dated) set-pieces here worthy of attention, and the funny and romantic leads may the journey worthwhile. The ending was great, especially when you realize that what all these characters, the good guys and the bad guys, are making such a fuss about doesn't even really matter to you. This is the birth of the classic Hitchcock trait; The MacGuffin. THE 39 STEPS is a classic, and a worthy curio for you movie buffs out there.

    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more.

The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps.

The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    Rating: **** out of 4. The great Alfred Hitchcock, who would later go on with grander projects with enough money to back him up, started with simpler, humbler efforts like this classic British spy thriller. It's obviously done in a low budget, with a feel to it that still embraces the silent era. But with Hitchcock's born talent, THE 39 STEPS is an unqualified success and still is one of the best in his career. Many might see it as a prototype for his later thrillers like SABOTEUR and the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but having seen it, it deserves to be seen in its own right. Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a typically pedestrian man who finds himself in a wave of conspiracy and murder when he meets and escorts a random woman (Lucie Mannheim) who is actually being pursued by enemy spies for a secret which she possesses. Now on the run himself, Hannay picks up a blonde stranger named Pamela (Madeline Caroll) and grows an affection for her while being pursued by enemy spies. There are a number of respectable (if dated) set-pieces here worthy of attention, and the funny and romantic leads may the journey worthwhile. The ending was great, especially when you realize that what all these characters, the good guys and the bad guys, are making such a fuss about doesn't even really matter to you. This is the birth of the classic Hitchcock trait; The MacGuffin. THE 39 STEPS is a classic, and a worthy curio for you movie buffs out there.

    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

    I understand fully the historic importance of this movie, since it was a very early example of Alfred Hitchcock's work in the suspense genre. That alone qualifies it to be considered a classic. In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more. Some elements of the story mystified me and as a result I found myself losing focus from time to time. The scenes in the Scottish man's house seemed unnecessary. The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    a nice novel. a great director. crumbs of spy story, romance, adventures, betrayal and duty. murder, secrets, bad guys and almost good guys, an innocent victim and amusing love story. charming, seductive, nostalgic movie. but not very interesting. movie of a time, it is only part of a prestigious filmography. after Bond experience, it is difficult to appreciate an adaptation in which drama is an old cloth. in which tension is slice from a tale presented by a child.so, the only feeling is the sweet tenderness for acting, situations, known recipes, Hitchcock tricks and air of a time face to face with terrible war. precious memories, lovely story and mark of magnificent filmmaker.

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more.

The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

    I understand fully the historic importance of this movie, since it was a very early example of Alfred Hitchcock's work in the suspense genre. That alone qualifies it to be considered a classic. In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more. Some elements of the story mystified me and as a result I found myself losing focus from time to time. The scenes in the Scottish man's house seemed unnecessary. The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

    I understand fully the historic importance of this movie, since it was a very early example of Alfred Hitchcock's work in the suspense genre. That alone qualifies it to be considered a classic. In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more. Some elements of the story mystified me and as a result I found myself losing focus from time to time. The scenes in the Scottish man's house seemed unnecessary. The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years.

Many might see it as a prototype for his later thrillers like SABOTEUR and the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but having seen it, it deserves to be seen in its own right. Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a typically pedestrian man who finds himself in a wave of conspiracy and murder when he meets and escorts a random woman (Lucie Mannheim) who is actually being pursued by enemy spies for a secret which she possesses.

    "Defense secret of Airways is about to cross the border through the keyword The 39 steps. Did they make it?" It's not look like a movie rather like a Play. As its a very old movie Very bad art direction and direction too. No depth in story also. But the technique of stealing the secret is awesome. Alfred Hitchcock stands really tall there. Great suspense. The movie proves that 2013 has astonishing technology but the 1935 movie has the great thinking. Movie could have been lot better. Hero looks like comedian for me. Not worth watching it.

    The one real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is that I wanted to see Alfred Hitchcock before he became the well known director of Psycho, North By Northwest, Vertigo and many more. I have a DVD set of 10 of his movies all made in the 1930's. This is the first one that I have watched and to be perfectly honest it really isn't anything really special. The movie's plot is that a man takes a woman home, she is a spy and later that night she dies. He is the prime suspect. He is also pursued by foreign spies after her because she gave him some secrets. He is to go to Scotland because the woman was looking for a man there who may help him. This movie is a decent little spy thriller for it's time. However to some modern audiences this movie may seem a bit slow. I personally couldn't really connect to any of the characters. If you want to watch Hitchcock in his early years then this might be one for you to see. But me personally, I don't think it's anything really special.

    A man in London tries to help a counterespionage agent. But when the agent is killed and he stands accused, he must go on the run to both save himself and also stop a spy ring trying to steal top secret information. In one of his earliest films, Alfred Hitchcock directs a great movie! The 39 Steps is an early Hitchcock gem, it's exciting, it's tense, it's funny, and of course it's suspenseful. It it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie, then it's got to have the one thing that he is known for, that is an eight letter word known as suspense. The acting in the movie is great, the black and white cinematography makes it look dark and dramatic, and on the whole, the movie is an excellent time! Hitchcock was known for directing many great movies, such as Vertigo, Notorious, Strangers On A Train, Pshyco, and many other great ones, but The 39 Steps in my opinion, is one of his best movies of his early years. He didn't make many good movies early on, his 1939 movie, Jamaica Inn was bad. But The 39 Steps is an exception, it is a great movie, the best of his early years in fact. Here's a few great things about it. Robert Donat gives a great performance as a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a woman and has to go on the run in an attempt to clear his name. Donat plays his character perfectly, the way he acted was so natural, that he was perfect. I also really liked Madeleine Carroll's performance in this movie, as somebody who is forced to accompany Robert Donat's character as he is on the run, and as you probably might have guessed, they eventually fall in love. The performances from the rest of the cast are also good ones, but Donat and Carroll give the two best performances in the movie, the chemistry between the two was perfect, they were perfect in their roles, I don't think that I could have seen anybody who was better than them, they were perfect. In short, great acting + great writing + great directing = a great movie, a great and suspenseful movie! If you want to see an early Hitchcock movie in which The Master Of Suspense is at the top of his game, then watch his 1935 marvel, The 39 Steps. In just an hour and forty-five minutes, you will see a movie that defines the meaning of suspense, actually, this movie is a combination of three movies, it combines suspense with tension, and it throws in a bit of laughs at the same time. If you liked this movie, then you should also see some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, like North By Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Notorious, To Catch A Thief, and Strangers On A Train. Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors who ever lived, he rarely made a bad movie, other than Jamacia Inn and a few other movies. But other than that, he was a man who could do no wrong, he was a genius. The 39 Steps is a great achievement for Alfred Hitchcock, in the end, the movie is certainly a movie that's worth a viewing or two. 10/10

    I understand fully the historic importance of this movie, since it was a very early example of Alfred Hitchcock's work in the suspense genre. That alone qualifies it to be considered a classic. In my opinion, however, that may be the only thing that qualifies this as a classic, and it astonishes me that so many people consider this a masterpiece. All I can observe is that Hitchcock got better as the years went on. A lot could be said about this. The story revolves around a Canadian man in London who gets involved in some sort of foreign espionage activity and ends up wrongly accused of murder. The movie tries to unravel the mystery. It did not, however, enthrall me. I thought it plodded along with performances that were passable but little more. Some elements of the story mystified me and as a result I found myself losing focus from time to time. The scenes in the Scottish man's house seemed unnecessary. The movie's high rating surprises me, quite frankly. The only reason I can come up with for the high rating is that it's early Hitchcock. In fairness, this isn't a bad movie. Compared to other movies of the era, it's what might be described as fair to middlin'. I've seen many worse movies from the 30's, but there are also movies from the 30's that seem timeless and can still hold me captive. Overall - 4/10

    a nice novel. a great director. crumbs of spy story, romance, adventures, betrayal and duty. murder, secrets, bad guys and almost good guys, an innocent victim and amusing love story. charming, seductive, nostalgic movie. but not very interesting. movie of a time, it is only part of a prestigious filmography. after Bond experience, it is difficult to appreciate an adaptation in which drama is an old cloth. in which tension is slice from a tale presented by a child.so, the only feeling is the sweet tenderness for acting, situations, known recipes, Hitchcock tricks and air of a time face to face with terrible war. precious memories, lovely story and mark of magnificent filmmaker.

    This early Hitchcock outing sees Robert Donat on the run from both a secret ring of spies and the police force. Pretty much everyone in the movie is determined to see him captured or dead. Yes, it's another in Hitchcock's long line of 'wronged man' type thrillers, and it's more than tempting to view this movie as an early forerunner of later classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It's a fun, worthwhile movie but it's not my favourite Hitchcock. The story feels a little dated and stodgy, even though the pacing is super-fast by 1930s standards. It's just that I've seen, and been spoilt by, Hitchcock's later works and this feels like a diluted, watered-down version of them. The kinetic scenes where Donat outwits his pursuers are all well achieved, but the mystery of the story feels a little too vague and not focused enough. Donat makes for a strong protagonist and shares genuine chemistry with Madeleine Carroll, to whom he's handcuffed for much of the production (another trend-setting element that would be mined by dozens of future filmmakers). Hitch's direction is more than adequate, and he elicits decent supporting performances from John Laurie (delightful as a mad crofter) and Godfrey Tearle (an urbane villain). There's little to dislike here, but the combination of poor quality video and sound detract from the viewing experience  if ever a film needed remastering, it's this one  and it feels like a dry run for the director's later greats.

    'The Thirty Nine Steps' Alfred Hitchcock (1935) BFI 100 #4 "I don't know how innocent you may be, but you're a woman and you're defenceless and you're alone on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer who'll stop at nothing to get you off his hands. If that's the situation you prefer have it my lovely and welcome." There is a sequence in Hitchcock's 'The Thirty Nine Steps' when a car is speeding down a Scottish hill. As our protagonist and his distrusting, unwitting blonde prot&eacute;g&eacute; realise that everything is not as it seems, we observe their realisation in close-up. Suddenly and seamlessly the camera that is so close to their faces exits the moving car and stops static on the hill as the vehicle continues to hurtle away. The appropriate response is "How the hell did he do that?" A quick glance at other cinematic releases from that year gives some idea of how exceptional an accomplishment this movie is. Other directors from that year just weren't doing the things that Mr Hitchcock was. Not that they were incompetent, just not as bloodthirsty with the available technology as he clearly was. Evidently, an immense personality with a heap of verve was pushing camera and crew to traverse a 'pre-Kubrickian' envelope, creating something that still technically outsmarts and thrills, despite also dating somewhat. It is the actors who date the piece: the performances are fine, but Robert Donat, watchable as he is, doesn't even try to sound Canadian and Peggy Ashcroft's Scottish accent is a little bit on the English side, but that level of authenticity barely mattered as much back then- Marlene Dietrich in 'Witness For the Prosecution' anyone? Nevertheless, each scene is vivid with a very individual imagination and a Hitchcock fan can tick off the riffs that the director would repeat in later blockbusters: the film opening with the lens on the protagonist's feet, as in 'Strangers on a Train,' tumultuous panic in the theatre, like in 'Torn Curtain,' a luckily resourceful man in the wrong place at the wrong time, up against the villainously well to do, just like 'North by Northwest' and of course the gleefully ill-treated blonde, ubiquitous in later works. I particularly enjoyed the high-jinks on the Forth Bridge, and I expect Mr Hitchcock did too. Exceptional and futuristic.

    This early Hitchcock thriller gets the viewers attention in the opening scene when shots ring out during a London music hall show. After the show a woman approaches Canadian Richard Hannay and tells him that she is a spy who is in grave danger after learning of a plot to sell government secrets to a foreign power. I assumed that she would turn out to be the 'romantic interest' in the film but she is soon dead with a knife in her back; before dying she mentioned The Thirty-nine Steps and was clutching a map of Scotland with a village circled. Hannay manages to evade the killer and boards a train to Scotland but by now the police think he is the killer. On the train he seeks the help of a woman but she alerts the police and he makes a daring escape on the Forth Bridge. He then makes his way to the village marked on the map where he finds the man he believes to be the murdered woman's contact but is in fact the chief conspirator! After a very lucky escape he has both the police and the killers after him. He is briefly captured and he finds himself handcuffed to the woman he first met on the train... she is believes he is a killer and as he forces her to escape with him he must persuade her of his innocence if he is to survive and expose the secret of the Thirty-nine Steps. 'The 39 Steps' is rightfully considered a classic; it is still exciting over seventy five years after it was made with thrilling chases, taut moments and a constant sense that the hero has nobody he can trust... the killers want him because he may expose them and everybody else wants him because they think he is a killer! The acting was solid with Robert Donat putting in a fine performance as Hannay and Madeleine Carroll being entirely believable as Pamela, the woman he met on the train. While the film is principally a thriller there are a few chuckles to be had such as the lingerie salesmen on the train who embarrasses another passenger while showing off his wares and later when Hannay is forced to give an off the cuff speech after being mistaken for somebody else when he stumbles into a political meeting. If you are a fan of early cinema, the films of Alfred Hitchcock or spy thrillers in general this is a must see.

    Watched this movie and at the same time I could see a genius in his formative years where he would use many of the devices in other movies later in his illustrous career. The Hitchcock standards are here to see the wrong man accused, the icy but elegant blonde, the use of the train, the evil traitor, the climatic scene where it all comes together. The movie started a bit slow and was somewhat stage like but as it got going it was very entertaining. The stars were serviceable and yes Ms. Carrol was very fetching. Helpful people aiding the good people another recurring motif foreshadowing many a Hitchcock saga. A great little film not a classic but better than most out there.

    Rating: **** out of 4. The great Alfred Hitchcock, who would later go on with grander projects with enough money to back him up, started with simpler, humbler efforts like this classic British spy thriller. It's obviously done in a low budget, with a feel to it that still embraces the silent era. But with Hitchcock's born talent, THE 39 STEPS is an unqualified success and still is one of the best in his career. Many might see it as a prototype for his later thrillers like SABOTEUR and the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but having seen it, it deserves to be seen in its own right. Robert Donat plays Richard Hannay, a typically pedestrian man who finds himself in a wave of conspiracy and murder when he meets and escorts a random woman (Lucie Mannheim) who is actually being pursued by enemy spies for a secret which she possesses. Now on the run himself, Hannay picks up a blonde stranger named Pamela (Madeline Caroll) and grows an affection for her while being pursued by enemy spies. There are a number of respectable (if dated) set-pieces here worthy of attention, and the funny and romantic leads may the journey worthwhile. The ending was great, especially when you realize that what all these characters, the good guys and the bad guys, are making such a fuss about doesn't even really matter to you. This is the birth of the classic Hitchcock trait; The MacGuffin. THE 39 STEPS is a classic, and a worthy curio for you movie buffs out there.
