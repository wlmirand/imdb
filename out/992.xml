    I don't know why this black comedy doesn't succeed. It's about a couple trying desperately to dispose of a dead body, which is pretty black. Sometimes these things work, as in "Arsenic And Old Lace," and sometimes they project not much more than mindlessness, as in "Weekend At Bernie's." While husband Keitel is off fishing, Cameron Diaz receives a visit at the beach house from an old flame. Nothing happens except that he dies naked in her bed of a heart attack. Keitel arrives home and accidentally breaks the neck of the corpse. Then they discover the boyfriend drank methanol and was poisoned. These developments ought to be funny but instead they sound desperate. Keitel neither looks nor sounds like a prominent judge whose career would be ruined by scandal, even though he envisions the tabloid headlines, "Prominent Judge Breaks Neck of Dead Naked Body." Cameron Diaz is gorgeous. Her eyes look so terribly blue, almost neon, in that sun tanned face perched on that lanky figure. But we're supposed to laugh when it's revealed that Keitel likes to keep his sausages in a cigar box in the refrigerator. The dialog morphs from stunned incredulity to agonized shouting. None of it's very amusing.

    Head Above Water is the very blackest of comedies, bordering on black farce. Cameron Diaz is a reformed bad girl, married to Harvey Keitel, the judge who has rescued her as a kind of social project. They are vacationing on his private island: the resident handyman (Craig Sheffer) lives in a shack across the bay. While the judge and the handyman are out fishing, Diaz is visited by Billy Zane, her ex-boyfriend, who is minded to entice her back to her old ways. Then things get complicated. This film is full of unlikely events, but the joy of it is that each unlikely development is entirely reasonable given that it is based on the event which immediately preceded it. The film is suspenseful, very funny, and has great performances from the small cast. Highly recommended.

    The acting is pretty good, and seeing Harvey Keitel playing in a dark comedy was a pleasant surprise. What was not so pleasant was the plot. It starts out looking like another attempt to get rid of a dead body, like "Enid is Sleeping" or Drop Dead Sexy". What it winds up being is an overly complicated, convoluted black comedy, that is only marginally successful. Some of the plot contrivances are so unrealistic that they weaken the entire movie. Things like the postcard, a vodka bottle, and most of all a runaway chainsaw are nothing but ludicrous distractions. To top things off we get a completely unnecessary boat explosion as part of the astoundingly unbelievable conclusion. Very average at best. - MERK

    "Head Above Water" certainly isn't a classic film or anything, yet it's probably worth a watch even though the film is short and the humor is dark and the plot is somewhat weak. The performances from Diaz and Keitel make it worth a view. Cameron Diaz as sexy as ever stars as Nathalie a free spirited young lady who's had a rough past with substance abuse, and supposedly now that her spouse is a judge named George(Harvey Keitel)her problems have washed ashore at their summer beach place. Upon a visit from an ex flame of Nathalie's a young man Kent(Billy Zane)takes an unexpected departure and things only become more complex when nearby friend Lance(Craig Sheffer)rounds out the mix in what is found to be a triple love triangle! Overall nothing great it's just some good and sexy work from Diaz in one of her early works as the plot just unravels to show a slick and messy triple love triangle.

    This is one strange movie for sure ! Not bad but so strange ! I just got confused after the first watching : what the hell was that ?! Till I discovered the whole thing in the leisurely second time. Ladies and gentlemen it's all about the woman ! This little inimical prejudicial black comedy is aiming at one point and one point only which's : WOMAN is the root of all evil ! The most wonderful effective way to die ! Or the eternal angel of death on earth who mows the souls of the men Only ! Just look at all the movie's events to catch on the wily hidden meaning : we have that dazzling young Eve (Cameron Diaz looks unbelievably breathtaking) and all of those Adams whom everyone of them is loving her and dealing with her in a different way (a fatherly husband, a lover friend, a repugnant enemy, and an outsider) while she innocently & unintentionally destroys them all ! So the theory of that movie is : we, as all the men, are dying because of the woman for indirect or direct reasons ! Even the poor old policeman at the end, as the fourth and last type of men around her in the movie's fake cosmos, got killed also instead of her ! As she is death itself !! So you'll find out about why it's an island (as an epitome of the world) and how any male got involved with the only woman there would meet his end (like it's heaven again yet with Eve as the devil !). Although the ways of deaths seemed so absurd but if you scrutinize a bit you'd detect that it all happened because of her, or because of the idiocy of men in front of her ! Therefore they were absurd indeed yet as the good sarcasm of those foolish males whom their only sin was loving, caring, helping out one female ! So, (Head Above Water)'s point of view is "The female is the most operative bane for the men as she has been created for cutting their heads off perfectly" ! It had been expressed here so powerfully but when it comes to reality I've never been convinced because whenever there is a beautiful woman, at least like (Diaz), I would give my heart & head gladly !

    "Head Above Water" is underrated. Despite its simplicity, it is a different movie experience. Why? Well, for one thing, there are very few movies with such few number of actors and characters, being Walt Disney's "Old Yeller" one of those rarities. But that's not all. The movie is classified as a macabre comedy but contains lots of suspense and is more of a thriller. Its events almost resemble what happens in the later "What Lies Benneath". Yes, "Head Above Water" has its moments of comedy. Some are light comedy, but most of them are black humor. People should beware of this. And it's not too much to remind that this movie can be shocking at times and also deals with very serious stuff, such as fear, panic, horror, sadism, violence and death. Nevertheless, it is very far from being a movie of extremes like "A Clockwork Orange" is and is certainly way more comfortable and pleasant to watch, but it can be a disturbing film. Speaking of the moments of comedy, one of the most hilarious is when George gets in the house, closes the door and has a tantrum attack, cursing what's happening to him. But the funniest moments come, in majority, from Lance and Nathalie. I also like very much the way how Lance makes George and Nathalie have a bad time while trying to get rid of Kent's body (without Lance knowing) and the part when Nathalie throws Lance to the water, followed by Nathalie swimming. That's when one of the movie's hottest scenes happen: she gives Lance a love kiss under the water. Later, when Lance asks &laquo;What was that today? Us, under the water?&raquo;, it's funny how she replies &laquo;Old times&raquo; and then he replies almost laughing &laquo;Old times? I don't remember that part&raquo;. Where "Head Above Water" takes place is unknown. But I've got to tell this: that is a beautiful island which can only be reached by boat. It has a very relaxing and beautiful atmosphere, surrounded only by the infinitive sea and the island's natural beauty. Not to mention that the house of this movie is humble and nice. It really makes one wanna spend holidays in such a wonderful place. As for the characters, Lance is an interesting, humorous and friendly character. But I also admire his pacific spirit and his capacity to hide his emotions and feelings. He's secretly in love with Nathalie, but he knows that she's a married woman, so he wouldn't cross that line. Craig Sheffer portrays very well this character. Nathalie is a loving and beautiful woman. I love her funny facial expressions and her smile. But she's also an extremely depressed and frightened woman. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her. This is by far one of Cameron Diaz's finest performances. This was before she got really famous. Back then she seemed to be a better actress and used to play better movie roles. Anyway, here she is just as good as in "The Mask". And boy, she looks equally gorgeous in this film! Those blue eyes, that pretty hair, those long and sexy legs and a smile to die for... wow! George, on the other hand, seems to be a nice guy at first, but as the movie runs he slowly reveals being a psychopath. Despite being a judge, his sadism grows stronger as the movie runs. Nevertheless, Harvey Keitel is great in this film. For me, he has never been this good, before or after. As for Kent, he's a cool character, but also a very depressed one with an alcohol problem and a heart's weakness. Billy Zane's performance as Kent is good, but with a slight problem: sometimes it's difficult to understand what is he saying. Also, he seems to "chew" his words sometimes. This movie has one of the strongest plots of all time. The story is strong, thrilling, dramatic, simple yet completely unpredictable, complex and confusing. The mystery of Kent's death is present practically all over the movie. While undeniably confusing, the conclusion I get is that George knew that Kent sent the postcard, knew he was coming and put it on Lance's mailbox to frame him. He also does that to avoid Nathalie from knowing the truth and, knowing he was coming, he plans secretly (and successfully) Kent's death. Both Lance and Nathalie become innocent victims of George's macabre scheme. "Head Above Water" is in general carefully made, with lots of attention to detail. While it has lots of solid arguments, its soundtrack is nothing special.

    I love comedies, especially when they are dark like "Head Above Water". I remember seeing this movie for the very first time about five years ago and it had me completely in its power. But in the meantime I've seen so many good movies, that I wondered if this would still be as good as I remembered it to be. The answer is no, not completely. Yes, it is still a very nice movie, but not as great as some other dark comedies that I've seen in the recent past. Nathalie has recently been married to George, a prominent judge who she met when she had to stand trial. They now have taken a holiday in Nathalie's idyllic summerhouse in the middle of nowhere and the only person in the neighborhood is Nathalie's old friend and neighbor Lance, who joins them. When George and Lance go on a fishing trip, Nathalie's former lover turns up. He has a couple of drinks and then falls asleep in Nathalies bed ... naked. When George and Lance suddenly come back home, Nathalie panics. She tries to wake Lance up, but he's dead and the only idea she can come up with is hiding his body under the floor board, where he will soon be discovered... Despite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you'll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with. In fact, all actors did a good and convincing job portraying their characters, but it wasn't enough to make this movie a masterpiece. What bothered me most was the fact that it all started to go too far. All the characters had to die in such an unbelievable and over-the-top way, that it spoiled a lot of my fun. Nevertheless I must admit that I enjoyed big parts of the movie and that's why I still give it a 7/10. It's not the best example of a dark comedy, but I've seen worse.

    This movie has got to be one of the greatest movies I ever seen. This is a true work of art. All the movies today are all big budget with their big effects and people are forgetting the most important part of a movie is the story which HEAD ABOVE WATER is very strong in. The characters are great. Keitel is awesome. Diaz is hilarious with her facial expressions. The movie keeps you guessing and laughing all the way through and only gets better as the story unfolds. It has a twist that you never see coming. The writing is great. And another thing I find interesting is how a story with only 3 people in it can hold the attention of the audience. That says something great about the writer. HEAD ABOVE WATER is a story and character driven movie that I'd recommend to anyone!

    Decent dark comedy that starred Cameron Diaz post-"The Mask" and pre-major-stardom. It's got some funny scenes and okay moments, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it other than if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or if it's on TV. 3/5 stars - John Ulmer

    I really enjoyed the performances in this film. Harvey Keitel again proves his tremendous range. Cameron Diaz is a very talented comedic actress and her makeup is very skillfully applied in this film. Billy Zane is again a third wheel (see Dead Calm and Titanic) but this time it's a comedy. The plot twists and turns are great fun to follow. 8/10.

Despite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you'll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with. In fact, all actors did a good and convincing job portraying their characters, but it wasn't enough to make this movie a masterpiece. What bothered me most was the fact that it all started to go too far. All the characters had to die in such an unbelievable and over-the-top way, that it spoiled a lot of my fun. Nevertheless I must admit that I enjoyed big parts of the movie and that's why I still give it a 7/10. It's not the best example of a dark comedy, but I've seen worse.

    This movie has got to be one of the greatest movies I ever seen. This is a true work of art. All the movies today are all big budget with their big effects and people are forgetting the most important part of a movie is the story which HEAD ABOVE WATER is very strong in. The characters are great. Keitel is awesome. Diaz is hilarious with her facial expressions. The movie keeps you guessing and laughing all the way through and only gets better as the story unfolds. It has a twist that you never see coming. The writing is great. And another thing I find interesting is how a story with only 3 people in it can hold the attention of the audience. That says something great about the writer. HEAD ABOVE WATER is a story and character driven movie that I'd recommend to anyone!

    Decent dark comedy that starred Cameron Diaz post-"The Mask" and pre-major-stardom. It's got some funny scenes and okay moments, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it other than if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or if it's on TV. 3/5 stars - John Ulmer

    I really enjoyed the performances in this film. Harvey Keitel again proves his tremendous range. Cameron Diaz is a very talented comedic actress and her makeup is very skillfully applied in this film. Billy Zane is again a third wheel (see Dead Calm and Titanic) but this time it's a comedy. The plot twists and turns are great fun to follow. 8/10.

    I don't know why this black comedy doesn't succeed. It's about a couple trying desperately to dispose of a dead body, which is pretty black. Sometimes these things work, as in "Arsenic And Old Lace," and sometimes they project not much more than mindlessness, as in "Weekend At Bernie's." While husband Keitel is off fishing, Cameron Diaz receives a visit at the beach house from an old flame. Nothing happens except that he dies naked in her bed of a heart attack. Keitel arrives home and accidentally breaks the neck of the corpse. Then they discover the boyfriend drank methanol and was poisoned. These developments ought to be funny but instead they sound desperate. Keitel neither looks nor sounds like a prominent judge whose career would be ruined by scandal, even though he envisions the tabloid headlines, "Prominent Judge Breaks Neck of Dead Naked Body." Cameron Diaz is gorgeous. Her eyes look so terribly blue, almost neon, in that sun tanned face perched on that lanky figure. But we're supposed to laugh when it's revealed that Keitel likes to keep his sausages in a cigar box in the refrigerator. The dialog morphs from stunned incredulity to agonized shouting. None of it's very amusing.

    Head Above Water is the very blackest of comedies, bordering on black farce. Cameron Diaz is a reformed bad girl, married to Harvey Keitel, the judge who has rescued her as a kind of social project. They are vacationing on his private island: the resident handyman (Craig Sheffer) lives in a shack across the bay. While the judge and the handyman are out fishing, Diaz is visited by Billy Zane, her ex-boyfriend, who is minded to entice her back to her old ways. Then things get complicated. This film is full of unlikely events, but the joy of it is that each unlikely development is entirely reasonable given that it is based on the event which immediately preceded it. The film is suspenseful, very funny, and has great performances from the small cast. Highly recommended.

    The acting is pretty good, and seeing Harvey Keitel playing in a dark comedy was a pleasant surprise. What was not so pleasant was the plot. It starts out looking like another attempt to get rid of a dead body, like "Enid is Sleeping" or Drop Dead Sexy". What it winds up being is an overly complicated, convoluted black comedy, that is only marginally successful. Some of the plot contrivances are so unrealistic that they weaken the entire movie. Things like the postcard, a vodka bottle, and most of all a runaway chainsaw are nothing but ludicrous distractions. To top things off we get a completely unnecessary boat explosion as part of the astoundingly unbelievable conclusion. Very average at best. - MERK

    "Head Above Water" certainly isn't a classic film or anything, yet it's probably worth a watch even though the film is short and the humor is dark and the plot is somewhat weak. The performances from Diaz and Keitel make it worth a view. Cameron Diaz as sexy as ever stars as Nathalie a free spirited young lady who's had a rough past with substance abuse, and supposedly now that her spouse is a judge named George(Harvey Keitel)her problems have washed ashore at their summer beach place. Upon a visit from an ex flame of Nathalie's a young man Kent(Billy Zane)takes an unexpected departure and things only become more complex when nearby friend Lance(Craig Sheffer)rounds out the mix in what is found to be a triple love triangle! Overall nothing great it's just some good and sexy work from Diaz in one of her early works as the plot just unravels to show a slick and messy triple love triangle.

    This is one strange movie for sure ! Not bad but so strange ! I just got confused after the first watching : what the hell was that ?! Till I discovered the whole thing in the leisurely second time. Ladies and gentlemen it's all about the woman ! This little inimical prejudicial black comedy is aiming at one point and one point only which's : WOMAN is the root of all evil ! The most wonderful effective way to die ! Or the eternal angel of death on earth who mows the souls of the men Only ! Just look at all the movie's events to catch on the wily hidden meaning : we have that dazzling young Eve (Cameron Diaz looks unbelievably breathtaking) and all of those Adams whom everyone of them is loving her and dealing with her in a different way (a fatherly husband, a lover friend, a repugnant enemy, and an outsider) while she innocently & unintentionally destroys them all ! So the theory of that movie is : we, as all the men, are dying because of the woman for indirect or direct reasons ! Even the poor old policeman at the end, as the fourth and last type of men around her in the movie's fake cosmos, got killed also instead of her ! As she is death itself !! So you'll find out about why it's an island (as an epitome of the world) and how any male got involved with the only woman there would meet his end (like it's heaven again yet with Eve as the devil !). Although the ways of deaths seemed so absurd but if you scrutinize a bit you'd detect that it all happened because of her, or because of the idiocy of men in front of her ! Therefore they were absurd indeed yet as the good sarcasm of those foolish males whom their only sin was loving, caring, helping out one female ! So, (Head Above Water)'s point of view is "The female is the most operative bane for the men as she has been created for cutting their heads off perfectly" ! It had been expressed here so powerfully but when it comes to reality I've never been convinced because whenever there is a beautiful woman, at least like (Diaz), I would give my heart & head gladly !

    "Head Above Water" is underrated. Despite its simplicity, it is a different movie experience. Why? Well, for one thing, there are very few movies with such few number of actors and characters, being Walt Disney's "Old Yeller" one of those rarities. But that's not all. The movie is classified as a macabre comedy but contains lots of suspense and is more of a thriller. Its events almost resemble what happens in the later "What Lies Benneath". Yes, "Head Above Water" has its moments of comedy. Some are light comedy, but most of them are black humor. People should beware of this. And it's not too much to remind that this movie can be shocking at times and also deals with very serious stuff, such as fear, panic, horror, sadism, violence and death. Nevertheless, it is very far from being a movie of extremes like "A Clockwork Orange" is and is certainly way more comfortable and pleasant to watch, but it can be a disturbing film. Speaking of the moments of comedy, one of the most hilarious is when George gets in the house, closes the door and has a tantrum attack, cursing what's happening to him. But the funniest moments come, in majority, from Lance and Nathalie. I also like very much the way how Lance makes George and Nathalie have a bad time while trying to get rid of Kent's body (without Lance knowing) and the part when Nathalie throws Lance to the water, followed by Nathalie swimming. That's when one of the movie's hottest scenes happen: she gives Lance a love kiss under the water. Later, when Lance asks &laquo;What was that today? Us, under the water?&raquo;, it's funny how she replies &laquo;Old times&raquo; and then he replies almost laughing &laquo;Old times? I don't remember that part&raquo;. Where "Head Above Water" takes place is unknown. But I've got to tell this: that is a beautiful island which can only be reached by boat. It has a very relaxing and beautiful atmosphere, surrounded only by the infinitive sea and the island's natural beauty. Not to mention that the house of this movie is humble and nice. It really makes one wanna spend holidays in such a wonderful place. As for the characters, Lance is an interesting, humorous and friendly character. But I also admire his pacific spirit and his capacity to hide his emotions and feelings. He's secretly in love with Nathalie, but he knows that she's a married woman, so he wouldn't cross that line. Craig Sheffer portrays very well this character. Nathalie is a loving and beautiful woman. I love her funny facial expressions and her smile. But she's also an extremely depressed and frightened woman. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her. This is by far one of Cameron Diaz's finest performances. This was before she got really famous. Back then she seemed to be a better actress and used to play better movie roles. Anyway, here she is just as good as in "The Mask". And boy, she looks equally gorgeous in this film! Those blue eyes, that pretty hair, those long and sexy legs and a smile to die for... wow! George, on the other hand, seems to be a nice guy at first, but as the movie runs he slowly reveals being a psychopath. Despite being a judge, his sadism grows stronger as the movie runs. Nevertheless, Harvey Keitel is great in this film. For me, he has never been this good, before or after. As for Kent, he's a cool character, but also a very depressed one with an alcohol problem and a heart's weakness. Billy Zane's performance as Kent is good, but with a slight problem: sometimes it's difficult to understand what is he saying. Also, he seems to "chew" his words sometimes. This movie has one of the strongest plots of all time. The story is strong, thrilling, dramatic, simple yet completely unpredictable, complex and confusing. The mystery of Kent's death is present practically all over the movie. While undeniably confusing, the conclusion I get is that George knew that Kent sent the postcard, knew he was coming and put it on Lance's mailbox to frame him. He also does that to avoid Nathalie from knowing the truth and, knowing he was coming, he plans secretly (and successfully) Kent's death. Both Lance and Nathalie become innocent victims of George's macabre scheme. "Head Above Water" is in general carefully made, with lots of attention to detail. While it has lots of solid arguments, its soundtrack is nothing special.

    I love comedies, especially when they are dark like "Head Above Water". I remember seeing this movie for the very first time about five years ago and it had me completely in its power. But in the meantime I've seen so many good movies, that I wondered if this would still be as good as I remembered it to be. The answer is no, not completely. Yes, it is still a very nice movie, but not as great as some other dark comedies that I've seen in the recent past. Nathalie has recently been married to George, a prominent judge who she met when she had to stand trial. They now have taken a holiday in Nathalie's idyllic summerhouse in the middle of nowhere and the only person in the neighborhood is Nathalie's old friend and neighbor Lance, who joins them. When George and Lance go on a fishing trip, Nathalie's former lover turns up. He has a couple of drinks and then falls asleep in Nathalies bed ... naked. When George and Lance suddenly come back home, Nathalie panics. She tries to wake Lance up, but he's dead and the only idea she can come up with is hiding his body under the floor board, where he will soon be discovered... Despite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you'll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with.

    I love comedies, especially when they are dark like "Head Above Water". I remember seeing this movie for the very first time about five years ago and it had me completely in its power. But in the meantime I've seen so many good movies, that I wondered if this would still be as good as I remembered it to be. The answer is no, not completely. Yes, it is still a very nice movie, but not as great as some other dark comedies that I've seen in the recent past. Nathalie has recently been married to George, a prominent judge who she met when she had to stand trial. They now have taken a holiday in Nathalie's idyllic summerhouse in the middle of nowhere and the only person in the neighborhood is Nathalie's old friend and neighbor Lance, who joins them. When George and Lance go on a fishing trip, Nathalie's former lover turns up. He has a couple of drinks and then falls asleep in Nathalies bed ... naked. When George and Lance suddenly come back home, Nathalie panics. She tries to wake Lance up, but he's dead and the only idea she can come up with is hiding his body under the floor board, where he will soon be discovered... Despite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you'll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with. In fact, all actors did a good and convincing job portraying their characters, but it wasn't enough to make this movie a masterpiece. What bothered me most was the fact that it all started to go too far. All the characters had to die in such an unbelievable and over-the-top way, that it spoiled a lot of my fun. Nevertheless I must admit that I enjoyed big parts of the movie and that's why I still give it a 7/10. It's not the best example of a dark comedy, but I've seen worse.

    This movie has got to be one of the greatest movies I ever seen. This is a true work of art. All the movies today are all big budget with their big effects and people are forgetting the most important part of a movie is the story which HEAD ABOVE WATER is very strong in. The characters are great. Keitel is awesome. Diaz is hilarious with her facial expressions. The movie keeps you guessing and laughing all the way through and only gets better as the story unfolds. It has a twist that you never see coming. The writing is great. And another thing I find interesting is how a story with only 3 people in it can hold the attention of the audience. That says something great about the writer. HEAD ABOVE WATER is a story and character driven movie that I'd recommend to anyone!

    Will be looked upon years from now as, "The one that Cameron Diaz made before she was really popular."

    Decent dark comedy that starred Cameron Diaz post-"The Mask" and pre-major-stardom. It's got some funny scenes and okay moments, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it other than if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or if it's on TV. 3/5 stars - John Ulmer

    I really enjoyed the performances in this film. Harvey Keitel again proves his tremendous range. Cameron Diaz is a very talented comedic actress and her makeup is very skillfully applied in this film. Billy Zane is again a third wheel (see Dead Calm and Titanic) but this time it's a comedy. The plot twists and turns are great fun to follow. 8/10.
