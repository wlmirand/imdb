 <sinopse>
  Comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales. Leslie's arch-rival, the mustached and black-attired Professor Fate vows to beat Leslie to the finish line in a car of Fate's own invention. The Blake Edwards style of slapstick and song originated with this movie. A dedication to Laurel and Hardy appears at the beginning of the film. Edwards' tribute to Stan and Ollie can be seen most clearly in the interaction between Professor Fate and his cohort Max, as well as in the operatic Pottsdorf pie fight.

    Blake Edwards directed this long farce about a professional daredevil(played by Tony Curtis as "The Great Leslie") who decides, in order to promote automobile sales, to stage a New York to Paris road race. He is challenged and relentlessly pursued by arch-rival Professor Fate(played very broadly by Jack Lemmon) and his inept assistant Max(Peter Falk). The beautiful Natalie Wood plays feminist/suffragette Maggie Dubois, who uses her connection to the local newspaper to attach herself to Leslie, much to his consternation. Plot goes on far too long, but even worse, is seldom funny, since it labors for laughs by throwing in everything from a (literally) mustache-twirling villain, to an extended pie-throwing fight, among assorted car crashes and crazy plot developments. Good cast cannot save it.

    Are grand slapstick films like this even made any longer? It seems even the children's comedies nowadays are vulgar and cynical. Not that I'm saying vulgar and cynical can't be entertaining, but it would be nice if there was still room for fare like The Great Race (1965), one of the breeziest comedy spectacles ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that this is a film that will make you feel like a kid again. The plot itself is like a Saturday morning cartoon of old: a daredevil named the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is partaking in an automobile race from New York to Paris, joined by his lackey Hezekiah (Keenan Wynn) and the reporter Miss Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). On the journey, he has to contend with his mustache-twirling rival Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his minion Max (Peter Falk), both willing to do anything to make sure they beat Leslie. The film is episodic, covering their misadventures across the globe. Though It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) is what comes to mind when people think of the short-lived genre of epic comedy, The Great Race is far superior due to focusing on five main characters and running at twenty minutes under three hours. Unlike the earlier film, this one knows when to give you a breather before delivering another volley of gags. The look of the movie itself is easy on the eyes, colorful and warm. The costumes are the stuff of cartoons: Leslie is always in an immaculately white suit and cap, Fate is head to toe in black, and Miss DuBois' outfits (which are wont to change even within the same scene!) come in every color on the rainbow. All the players are great, but the one everyone always remembers is Jack Lemmon's outrageous mustachioed villain, Professor Fate. He leaves much more of an impression then the film's white clad hero, but then again, don't the bad guys usually do? You can tell Lemmon is having the time of his life and consequently, so do we. A perfect film for a rainy day.

    The Great Race has been described as live action cartoon, and that is when it's comedy is at it's most appealing. In the opening minutes Prof fate and Max (Lemmon and Falk)endure cartoonish falls, crashes and explosions, and the comparison to old WB cartoons is apt. Then we get into the plot , and as soon as the racers hit the American west, machinations of the characters take over and the slapstick falters. By the time the story reaches the mythical kingdom of Potsdorf (or something), the plot is dragging the film down badly. It mostly limps home from there. The thing that makes the film watchable is the spectacle, faux early 20th century costuming, stunt work and attention to detail, all of which are outstanding. This is one of the better looking comedies you will ever see, with bright colors everywhere and confident and elaborate staging. It almost doesn't matter that it's not really very funny.

    The Great Race is an epic comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents. From Blake Edwards (the creator of The Pink Panther series) comes a hysterical motion picture that is bound to have you laughing yourself silly, that film is Edwards' 1965 masterwork, The Great Race. Initially, this movie underperformed because it came out around the time of another classic comedy, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. In my point of view, you can't really compare the two films, except for that they are both hysterical classics that are among the funniest movies of all time. I was expecting a movie with good acting and a lot of funny moments. I got a lot more than that! I ended up getting a hysterical movie with great acting and a lot of outrageous and hilarious moments! When I watched this, I just couldn't stop laughing. Furthermore, this movie proves that Blake Edwards was a comedic genius. Before I saw this movie, I had only seen the first five Pink Panther movies, and while those movies are a lot of fun, The Great Race is a whole ton of more fun! Tony Curtis leads out the cast as The Great Leslie, a man who is competing in a race across three continents. Curtis was wonderful in his role, especially during the climatic Prisoner Of Zenda scenes. Natalie Wood is hilarious as Maggie Dubois, a reporter determined to get a story in the papers. To get this story, she joins the race herself. And of course, I cannot review this film without mentioning Jack Lemmon and his legendary performance as Professor Fate. As much as I enjoyed everybody else in this movie, Lemmon was the best. Professor Fate is the main antagonist, and he represents the stereotypical melodramatic villain, he repeatedly tries to make things bad for The Great Leslie, but most of his plans end up backfiring, resulting in gut-busting hysterical scenes! And then there is Peter Falk as Maximilian Meen, Fate's bumbling right hand man. Everyone in the movie did a fabulous job, but Jack Lemmon did the best. A historical fact: Jack Lemmon's character of Professor Fate was the main inspiration for Dick Dastardly, the villain of the classic cartoon, Wacky Races. Attention all movie fans: those who have not seen The Great Race have definitely got to do so, as there are a gargantuan amount of laughs to be found in the movie! You will split your sides when you see what is considered to be the greatest pie fight in movie history, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing when you see Jack Lemmon in his legendary performance as the flamboyant and villainous Professor Fate. More trivia: this was the second of two movies that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis appeared in together, the first was 1959's Some Like It Hot. What do Some Like It Hot and The Great Race have in common? They are both comedy classics that are among the funniest movies ever made. If you loved Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, then step right up for another race of a lifetime. When you watch The Great Race, you will not be able to stop laughing! I award this movie a perfect rating of ten out of ten for being a legendary movie with countless laughs! Don't miss out on all of the fun! 10/10

    An international road race centres around white-clad goodie The Great Leslie and black-clad baddie Professor Fate. Appearing very soon after the similar Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines (the two films must have been in production at the same time, what a coincidence, eh?), The Great Race is to my mind the more enjoyable movie. Tony Curtis' Leslie has just enough twinkle (in Curtis' performance, as well as animated) to avoid being insufferable, and Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate, clearly the inspiration for Wacky Races' Dick Dastardly, is hysterical (Peter Falk as henchman Maximilian is every bit as funny). Natalie Wood was never more gorgeous. Professor Fate's car is wonderful, the movie is packed full of gags and, as is well known, the film contains the best custard fight sequence of all time - never subsequently equalled - during the Prisoner Of Zenda spoof.

    I still like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" better, and it's ironic that these 2 films came out with weeks of each other. Essentially, an "Around the World in 80 Days" throwback with a huge cast, some exotic locales to balance the obvious "back-lot and studio" sets, and the improbable premise of a race around the world, the hard way, from New York to Paris without crossing the English Channel or any oceans. My first complaint is that there aren't enough participants. It ends up being only "The Great Lesley" (Curtis) and "Prof. Fate" (Lemmon) who compete in 90% of the race. In "Magnificent Men..." it seems like more of a "true" race with several memorable racing entrants. That aside, it's a great romp for all with a very familiar plot that borrows from everything you have ever seen on film: from Hal Roach Studio's pie throwing classics to "The Prince and the Pauper" (Jack Lemmon in a dual role). Also, it's just too darn long, clocking in at 2:45 in length. Is it funny? It sure is. It's a wonderful opportunity to see Natale Wood, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Ross Martin and several other stars at the height of their careers and (mostly) young. There are too many "cameo" stars in the cast to even try to mention everyone; except to say that Dorothy Provine's saloon song is almost better than the Oscar-winning "Sweetheart Tree." There are several similar movies that I like better, but Natale Wood's performance is "haunting". She looks terrific, but it's not her best role. Tony Curtis (bare chested of course) "swashbuckles" with Ross Martin in a "duel to the death" where no one dies. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk make a great comedy team, but they are not Laurel and Hardy, to be sure. A Saturday afternoon "guilty pleasure" often run on TCM; fully restored and uncut!

    Liked the song. Funny movie. Loved the bridal costume near the end. Loved Leslie's white costuming, and all of Maggie's beautiful outfits. Vivian Vance's costuming was excellent. Dastardly Fate and crown prince both played by great actor Jack Lemmon. Remembering Lemmon and Curtis dressing and acting as women in "Some Like It Hot" (too bad Marilyn wasn't in this picture - The Great Race). Liked this movie in 1965, and still like it. Too bad the principals mainly deceased; not sure about Larry Storch - a friend of Curtis' from long time earlier. Don't think Storch principal here, but definitely a comedic force.

    A solid 8 rating from me. This is a must see to any fan of Edwards or any cast member. Sure it's long and drives off course a few times, but Lemmon and Falk hold it all together, and of course Wood and Curtis are eye candy for guys and gals. The sets are lavish, the kind you rarely see these days. The music by Henry Mancini is perfect, even the sort of stuck on love ballad. They don't make 'em like this anymore and it's just a shame. I have no idea why this movie isn't on more top lists for people. It's just good entertainment.

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).

    Blake Edwards directed this long farce about a professional daredevil(played by Tony Curtis as "The Great Leslie") who decides, in order to promote automobile sales, to stage a New York to Paris road race. He is challenged and relentlessly pursued by arch-rival Professor Fate(played very broadly by Jack Lemmon) and his inept assistant Max(Peter Falk). The beautiful Natalie Wood plays feminist/suffragette Maggie Dubois, who uses her connection to the local newspaper to attach herself to Leslie, much to his consternation. Plot goes on far too long, but even worse, is seldom funny, since it labors for laughs by throwing in everything from a (literally) mustache-twirling villain, to an extended pie-throwing fight, among assorted car crashes and crazy plot developments. Good cast cannot save it.

    Are grand slapstick films like this even made any longer? It seems even the children's comedies nowadays are vulgar and cynical. Not that I'm saying vulgar and cynical can't be entertaining, but it would be nice if there was still room for fare like The Great Race (1965), one of the breeziest comedy spectacles ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that this is a film that will make you feel like a kid again. The plot itself is like a Saturday morning cartoon of old: a daredevil named the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is partaking in an automobile race from New York to Paris, joined by his lackey Hezekiah (Keenan Wynn) and the reporter Miss Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). On the journey, he has to contend with his mustache-twirling rival Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his minion Max (Peter Falk), both willing to do anything to make sure they beat Leslie. The film is episodic, covering their misadventures across the globe. Though It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) is what comes to mind when people think of the short-lived genre of epic comedy, The Great Race is far superior due to focusing on five main characters and running at twenty minutes under three hours. Unlike the earlier film, this one knows when to give you a breather before delivering another volley of gags. The look of the movie itself is easy on the eyes, colorful and warm. The costumes are the stuff of cartoons: Leslie is always in an immaculately white suit and cap, Fate is head to toe in black, and Miss DuBois' outfits (which are wont to change even within the same scene!) come in every color on the rainbow. All the players are great, but the one everyone always remembers is Jack Lemmon's outrageous mustachioed villain, Professor Fate. He leaves much more of an impression then the film's white clad hero, but then again, don't the bad guys usually do? You can tell Lemmon is having the time of his life and consequently, so do we. A perfect film for a rainy day.

    The Great Race has been described as live action cartoon, and that is when it's comedy is at it's most appealing. In the opening minutes Prof fate and Max (Lemmon and Falk)endure cartoonish falls, crashes and explosions, and the comparison to old WB cartoons is apt. Then we get into the plot , and as soon as the racers hit the American west, machinations of the characters take over and the slapstick falters. By the time the story reaches the mythical kingdom of Potsdorf (or something), the plot is dragging the film down badly. It mostly limps home from there. The thing that makes the film watchable is the spectacle, faux early 20th century costuming, stunt work and attention to detail, all of which are outstanding. This is one of the better looking comedies you will ever see, with bright colors everywhere and confident and elaborate staging. It almost doesn't matter that it's not really very funny.

    The Great Race is an epic comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents. From Blake Edwards (the creator of The Pink Panther series) comes a hysterical motion picture that is bound to have you laughing yourself silly, that film is Edwards' 1965 masterwork, The Great Race. Initially, this movie underperformed because it came out around the time of another classic comedy, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. In my point of view, you can't really compare the two films, except for that they are both hysterical classics that are among the funniest movies of all time. I was expecting a movie with good acting and a lot of funny moments. I got a lot more than that! I ended up getting a hysterical movie with great acting and a lot of outrageous and hilarious moments! When I watched this, I just couldn't stop laughing. Furthermore, this movie proves that Blake Edwards was a comedic genius. Before I saw this movie, I had only seen the first five Pink Panther movies, and while those movies are a lot of fun, The Great Race is a whole ton of more fun! Tony Curtis leads out the cast as The Great Leslie, a man who is competing in a race across three continents. Curtis was wonderful in his role, especially during the climatic Prisoner Of Zenda scenes. Natalie Wood is hilarious as Maggie Dubois, a reporter determined to get a story in the papers. To get this story, she joins the race herself. And of course, I cannot review this film without mentioning Jack Lemmon and his legendary performance as Professor Fate. As much as I enjoyed everybody else in this movie, Lemmon was the best. Professor Fate is the main antagonist, and he represents the stereotypical melodramatic villain, he repeatedly tries to make things bad for The Great Leslie, but most of his plans end up backfiring, resulting in gut-busting hysterical scenes! And then there is Peter Falk as Maximilian Meen, Fate's bumbling right hand man. Everyone in the movie did a fabulous job, but Jack Lemmon did the best. A historical fact: Jack Lemmon's character of Professor Fate was the main inspiration for Dick Dastardly, the villain of the classic cartoon, Wacky Races. Attention all movie fans: those who have not seen The Great Race have definitely got to do so, as there are a gargantuan amount of laughs to be found in the movie! You will split your sides when you see what is considered to be the greatest pie fight in movie history, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing when you see Jack Lemmon in his legendary performance as the flamboyant and villainous Professor Fate. More trivia: this was the second of two movies that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis appeared in together, the first was 1959's Some Like It Hot. What do Some Like It Hot and The Great Race have in common? They are both comedy classics that are among the funniest movies ever made. If you loved Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, then step right up for another race of a lifetime. When you watch The Great Race, you will not be able to stop laughing! I award this movie a perfect rating of ten out of ten for being a legendary movie with countless laughs! Don't miss out on all of the fun! 10/10

    An international road race centres around white-clad goodie The Great Leslie and black-clad baddie Professor Fate. Appearing very soon after the similar Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines (the two films must have been in production at the same time, what a coincidence, eh?), The Great Race is to my mind the more enjoyable movie. Tony Curtis' Leslie has just enough twinkle (in Curtis' performance, as well as animated) to avoid being insufferable, and Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate, clearly the inspiration for Wacky Races' Dick Dastardly, is hysterical (Peter Falk as henchman Maximilian is every bit as funny). Natalie Wood was never more gorgeous. Professor Fate's car is wonderful, the movie is packed full of gags and, as is well known, the film contains the best custard fight sequence of all time - never subsequently equalled - during the Prisoner Of Zenda spoof.

    I still like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" better, and it's ironic that these 2 films came out with weeks of each other. Essentially, an "Around the World in 80 Days" throwback with a huge cast, some exotic locales to balance the obvious "back-lot and studio" sets, and the improbable premise of a race around the world, the hard way, from New York to Paris without crossing the English Channel or any oceans. My first complaint is that there aren't enough participants. It ends up being only "The Great Lesley" (Curtis) and "Prof. Fate" (Lemmon) who compete in 90% of the race. In "Magnificent Men..." it seems like more of a "true" race with several memorable racing entrants. That aside, it's a great romp for all with a very familiar plot that borrows from everything you have ever seen on film: from Hal Roach Studio's pie throwing classics to "The Prince and the Pauper" (Jack Lemmon in a dual role). Also, it's just too darn long, clocking in at 2:45 in length. Is it funny? It sure is. It's a wonderful opportunity to see Natale Wood, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Ross Martin and several other stars at the height of their careers and (mostly) young. There are too many "cameo" stars in the cast to even try to mention everyone; except to say that Dorothy Provine's saloon song is almost better than the Oscar-winning "Sweetheart Tree." There are several similar movies that I like better, but Natale Wood's performance is "haunting". She looks terrific, but it's not her best role. Tony Curtis (bare chested of course) "swashbuckles" with Ross Martin in a "duel to the death" where no one dies. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk make a great comedy team, but they are not Laurel and Hardy, to be sure. A Saturday afternoon "guilty pleasure" often run on TCM; fully restored and uncut!

    Liked the song. Funny movie. Loved the bridal costume near the end. Loved Leslie's white costuming, and all of Maggie's beautiful outfits. Vivian Vance's costuming was excellent. Dastardly Fate and crown prince both played by great actor Jack Lemmon. Remembering Lemmon and Curtis dressing and acting as women in "Some Like It Hot" (too bad Marilyn wasn't in this picture - The Great Race). Liked this movie in 1965, and still like it. Too bad the principals mainly deceased; not sure about Larry Storch - a friend of Curtis' from long time earlier. Don't think Storch principal here, but definitely a comedic force.

    A solid 8 rating from me. This is a must see to any fan of Edwards or any cast member. Sure it's long and drives off course a few times, but Lemmon and Falk hold it all together, and of course Wood and Curtis are eye candy for guys and gals. The sets are lavish, the kind you rarely see these days. The music by Henry Mancini is perfect, even the sort of stuck on love ballad. They don't make 'em like this anymore and it's just a shame. I have no idea why this movie isn't on more top lists for people. It's just good entertainment.

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).

    Blake Edwards directed this long farce about a professional daredevil(played by Tony Curtis as "The Great Leslie") who decides, in order to promote automobile sales, to stage a New York to Paris road race. He is challenged and relentlessly pursued by arch-rival Professor Fate(played very broadly by Jack Lemmon) and his inept assistant Max(Peter Falk). The beautiful Natalie Wood plays feminist/suffragette Maggie Dubois, who uses her connection to the local newspaper to attach herself to Leslie, much to his consternation. Plot goes on far too long, but even worse, is seldom funny, since it labors for laughs by throwing in everything from a (literally) mustache-twirling villain, to an extended pie-throwing fight, among assorted car crashes and crazy plot developments. Good cast cannot save it.

    Are grand slapstick films like this even made any longer? It seems even the children's comedies nowadays are vulgar and cynical. Not that I'm saying vulgar and cynical can't be entertaining, but it would be nice if there was still room for fare like The Great Race (1965), one of the breeziest comedy spectacles ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that this is a film that will make you feel like a kid again. The plot itself is like a Saturday morning cartoon of old: a daredevil named the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is partaking in an automobile race from New York to Paris, joined by his lackey Hezekiah (Keenan Wynn) and the reporter Miss Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). On the journey, he has to contend with his mustache-twirling rival Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his minion Max (Peter Falk), both willing to do anything to make sure they beat Leslie. The film is episodic, covering their misadventures across the globe. Though It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) is what comes to mind when people think of the short-lived genre of epic comedy, The Great Race is far superior due to focusing on five main characters and running at twenty minutes under three hours. Unlike the earlier film, this one knows when to give you a breather before delivering another volley of gags. The look of the movie itself is easy on the eyes, colorful and warm. The costumes are the stuff of cartoons: Leslie is always in an immaculately white suit and cap, Fate is head to toe in black, and Miss DuBois' outfits (which are wont to change even within the same scene!) come in every color on the rainbow. All the players are great, but the one everyone always remembers is Jack Lemmon's outrageous mustachioed villain, Professor Fate. He leaves much more of an impression then the film's white clad hero, but then again, don't the bad guys usually do? You can tell Lemmon is having the time of his life and consequently, so do we. A perfect film for a rainy day.

    The Great Race has been described as live action cartoon, and that is when it's comedy is at it's most appealing. In the opening minutes Prof fate and Max (Lemmon and Falk)endure cartoonish falls, crashes and explosions, and the comparison to old WB cartoons is apt. Then we get into the plot , and as soon as the racers hit the American west, machinations of the characters take over and the slapstick falters. By the time the story reaches the mythical kingdom of Potsdorf (or something), the plot is dragging the film down badly. It mostly limps home from there. The thing that makes the film watchable is the spectacle, faux early 20th century costuming, stunt work and attention to detail, all of which are outstanding. This is one of the better looking comedies you will ever see, with bright colors everywhere and confident and elaborate staging. It almost doesn't matter that it's not really very funny.

    The Great Race is an epic comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents. From Blake Edwards (the creator of The Pink Panther series) comes a hysterical motion picture that is bound to have you laughing yourself silly, that film is Edwards' 1965 masterwork, The Great Race. Initially, this movie underperformed because it came out around the time of another classic comedy, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. In my point of view, you can't really compare the two films, except for that they are both hysterical classics that are among the funniest movies of all time. I was expecting a movie with good acting and a lot of funny moments. I got a lot more than that! I ended up getting a hysterical movie with great acting and a lot of outrageous and hilarious moments! When I watched this, I just couldn't stop laughing. Furthermore, this movie proves that Blake Edwards was a comedic genius. Before I saw this movie, I had only seen the first five Pink Panther movies, and while those movies are a lot of fun, The Great Race is a whole ton of more fun! Tony Curtis leads out the cast as The Great Leslie, a man who is competing in a race across three continents. Curtis was wonderful in his role, especially during the climatic Prisoner Of Zenda scenes. Natalie Wood is hilarious as Maggie Dubois, a reporter determined to get a story in the papers. To get this story, she joins the race herself. And of course, I cannot review this film without mentioning Jack Lemmon and his legendary performance as Professor Fate. As much as I enjoyed everybody else in this movie, Lemmon was the best. Professor Fate is the main antagonist, and he represents the stereotypical melodramatic villain, he repeatedly tries to make things bad for The Great Leslie, but most of his plans end up backfiring, resulting in gut-busting hysterical scenes! And then there is Peter Falk as Maximilian Meen, Fate's bumbling right hand man. Everyone in the movie did a fabulous job, but Jack Lemmon did the best. A historical fact: Jack Lemmon's character of Professor Fate was the main inspiration for Dick Dastardly, the villain of the classic cartoon, Wacky Races. Attention all movie fans: those who have not seen The Great Race have definitely got to do so, as there are a gargantuan amount of laughs to be found in the movie! You will split your sides when you see what is considered to be the greatest pie fight in movie history, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing when you see Jack Lemmon in his legendary performance as the flamboyant and villainous Professor Fate. More trivia: this was the second of two movies that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis appeared in together, the first was 1959's Some Like It Hot. What do Some Like It Hot and The Great Race have in common? They are both comedy classics that are among the funniest movies ever made. If you loved Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, then step right up for another race of a lifetime. When you watch The Great Race, you will not be able to stop laughing! I award this movie a perfect rating of ten out of ten for being a legendary movie with countless laughs! Don't miss out on all of the fun! 10/10

    An international road race centres around white-clad goodie The Great Leslie and black-clad baddie Professor Fate. Appearing very soon after the similar Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines (the two films must have been in production at the same time, what a coincidence, eh?), The Great Race is to my mind the more enjoyable movie. Tony Curtis' Leslie has just enough twinkle (in Curtis' performance, as well as animated) to avoid being insufferable, and Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate, clearly the inspiration for Wacky Races' Dick Dastardly, is hysterical (Peter Falk as henchman Maximilian is every bit as funny). Natalie Wood was never more gorgeous. Professor Fate's car is wonderful, the movie is packed full of gags and, as is well known, the film contains the best custard fight sequence of all time - never subsequently equalled - during the Prisoner Of Zenda spoof.

    I still like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" better, and it's ironic that these 2 films came out with weeks of each other. Essentially, an "Around the World in 80 Days" throwback with a huge cast, some exotic locales to balance the obvious "back-lot and studio" sets, and the improbable premise of a race around the world, the hard way, from New York to Paris without crossing the English Channel or any oceans. My first complaint is that there aren't enough participants. It ends up being only "The Great Lesley" (Curtis) and "Prof. Fate" (Lemmon) who compete in 90% of the race. In "Magnificent Men..." it seems like more of a "true" race with several memorable racing entrants. That aside, it's a great romp for all with a very familiar plot that borrows from everything you have ever seen on film: from Hal Roach Studio's pie throwing classics to "The Prince and the Pauper" (Jack Lemmon in a dual role). Also, it's just too darn long, clocking in at 2:45 in length. Is it funny? It sure is. It's a wonderful opportunity to see Natale Wood, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Ross Martin and several other stars at the height of their careers and (mostly) young. There are too many "cameo" stars in the cast to even try to mention everyone; except to say that Dorothy Provine's saloon song is almost better than the Oscar-winning "Sweetheart Tree." There are several similar movies that I like better, but Natale Wood's performance is "haunting". She looks terrific, but it's not her best role. Tony Curtis (bare chested of course) "swashbuckles" with Ross Martin in a "duel to the death" where no one dies. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk make a great comedy team, but they are not Laurel and Hardy, to be sure. A Saturday afternoon "guilty pleasure" often run on TCM; fully restored and uncut!

    Liked the song. Funny movie. Loved the bridal costume near the end. Loved Leslie's white costuming, and all of Maggie's beautiful outfits. Vivian Vance's costuming was excellent. Dastardly Fate and crown prince both played by great actor Jack Lemmon. Remembering Lemmon and Curtis dressing and acting as women in "Some Like It Hot" (too bad Marilyn wasn't in this picture - The Great Race). Liked this movie in 1965, and still like it. Too bad the principals mainly deceased; not sure about Larry Storch - a friend of Curtis' from long time earlier. Don't think Storch principal here, but definitely a comedic force.

    A solid 8 rating from me. This is a must see to any fan of Edwards or any cast member. Sure it's long and drives off course a few times, but Lemmon and Falk hold it all together, and of course Wood and Curtis are eye candy for guys and gals. The sets are lavish, the kind you rarely see these days. The music by Henry Mancini is perfect, even the sort of stuck on love ballad. They don't make 'em like this anymore and it's just a shame. I have no idea why this movie isn't on more top lists for people. It's just good entertainment.

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).

    Blake Edwards directed this long farce about a professional daredevil(played by Tony Curtis as "The Great Leslie") who decides, in order to promote automobile sales, to stage a New York to Paris road race. He is challenged and relentlessly pursued by arch-rival Professor Fate(played very broadly by Jack Lemmon) and his inept assistant Max(Peter Falk). The beautiful Natalie Wood plays feminist/suffragette Maggie Dubois, who uses her connection to the local newspaper to attach herself to Leslie, much to his consternation. Plot goes on far too long, but even worse, is seldom funny, since it labors for laughs by throwing in everything from a (literally) mustache-twirling villain, to an extended pie-throwing fight, among assorted car crashes and crazy plot developments. Good cast cannot save it.

    Are grand slapstick films like this even made any longer? It seems even the children's comedies nowadays are vulgar and cynical. Not that I'm saying vulgar and cynical can't be entertaining, but it would be nice if there was still room for fare like The Great Race (1965), one of the breeziest comedy spectacles ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that this is a film that will make you feel like a kid again. The plot itself is like a Saturday morning cartoon of old: a daredevil named the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is partaking in an automobile race from New York to Paris, joined by his lackey Hezekiah (Keenan Wynn) and the reporter Miss Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). On the journey, he has to contend with his mustache-twirling rival Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his minion Max (Peter Falk), both willing to do anything to make sure they beat Leslie. The film is episodic, covering their misadventures across the globe. Though It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) is what comes to mind when people think of the short-lived genre of epic comedy, The Great Race is far superior due to focusing on five main characters and running at twenty minutes under three hours. Unlike the earlier film, this one knows when to give you a breather before delivering another volley of gags. The look of the movie itself is easy on the eyes, colorful and warm. The costumes are the stuff of cartoons: Leslie is always in an immaculately white suit and cap, Fate is head to toe in black, and Miss DuBois' outfits (which are wont to change even within the same scene!) come in every color on the rainbow. All the players are great, but the one everyone always remembers is Jack Lemmon's outrageous mustachioed villain, Professor Fate. He leaves much more of an impression then the film's white clad hero, but then again, don't the bad guys usually do? You can tell Lemmon is having the time of his life and consequently, so do we. A perfect film for a rainy day.

    The Great Race has been described as live action cartoon, and that is when it's comedy is at it's most appealing. In the opening minutes Prof fate and Max (Lemmon and Falk)endure cartoonish falls, crashes and explosions, and the comparison to old WB cartoons is apt. Then we get into the plot , and as soon as the racers hit the American west, machinations of the characters take over and the slapstick falters. By the time the story reaches the mythical kingdom of Potsdorf (or something), the plot is dragging the film down badly. It mostly limps home from there. The thing that makes the film watchable is the spectacle, faux early 20th century costuming, stunt work and attention to detail, all of which are outstanding. This is one of the better looking comedies you will ever see, with bright colors everywhere and confident and elaborate staging. It almost doesn't matter that it's not really very funny.

    The Great Race is an epic comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents. From Blake Edwards (the creator of The Pink Panther series) comes a hysterical motion picture that is bound to have you laughing yourself silly, that film is Edwards' 1965 masterwork, The Great Race. Initially, this movie underperformed because it came out around the time of another classic comedy, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. In my point of view, you can't really compare the two films, except for that they are both hysterical classics that are among the funniest movies of all time. I was expecting a movie with good acting and a lot of funny moments. I got a lot more than that! I ended up getting a hysterical movie with great acting and a lot of outrageous and hilarious moments! When I watched this, I just couldn't stop laughing. Furthermore, this movie proves that Blake Edwards was a comedic genius. Before I saw this movie, I had only seen the first five Pink Panther movies, and while those movies are a lot of fun, The Great Race is a whole ton of more fun! Tony Curtis leads out the cast as The Great Leslie, a man who is competing in a race across three continents. Curtis was wonderful in his role, especially during the climatic Prisoner Of Zenda scenes. Natalie Wood is hilarious as Maggie Dubois, a reporter determined to get a story in the papers. To get this story, she joins the race herself. And of course, I cannot review this film without mentioning Jack Lemmon and his legendary performance as Professor Fate. As much as I enjoyed everybody else in this movie, Lemmon was the best. Professor Fate is the main antagonist, and he represents the stereotypical melodramatic villain, he repeatedly tries to make things bad for The Great Leslie, but most of his plans end up backfiring, resulting in gut-busting hysterical scenes! And then there is Peter Falk as Maximilian Meen, Fate's bumbling right hand man. Everyone in the movie did a fabulous job, but Jack Lemmon did the best. A historical fact: Jack Lemmon's character of Professor Fate was the main inspiration for Dick Dastardly, the villain of the classic cartoon, Wacky Races. Attention all movie fans: those who have not seen The Great Race have definitely got to do so, as there are a gargantuan amount of laughs to be found in the movie! You will split your sides when you see what is considered to be the greatest pie fight in movie history, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing when you see Jack Lemmon in his legendary performance as the flamboyant and villainous Professor Fate. More trivia: this was the second of two movies that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis appeared in together, the first was 1959's Some Like It Hot. What do Some Like It Hot and The Great Race have in common? They are both comedy classics that are among the funniest movies ever made. If you loved Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, then step right up for another race of a lifetime. When you watch The Great Race, you will not be able to stop laughing! I award this movie a perfect rating of ten out of ten for being a legendary movie with countless laughs! Don't miss out on all of the fun! 10/10

    An international road race centres around white-clad goodie The Great Leslie and black-clad baddie Professor Fate. Appearing very soon after the similar Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines (the two films must have been in production at the same time, what a coincidence, eh?), The Great Race is to my mind the more enjoyable movie. Tony Curtis' Leslie has just enough twinkle (in Curtis' performance, as well as animated) to avoid being insufferable, and Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate, clearly the inspiration for Wacky Races' Dick Dastardly, is hysterical (Peter Falk as henchman Maximilian is every bit as funny). Natalie Wood was never more gorgeous. Professor Fate's car is wonderful, the movie is packed full of gags and, as is well known, the film contains the best custard fight sequence of all time - never subsequently equalled - during the Prisoner Of Zenda spoof.

    I still like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" better, and it's ironic that these 2 films came out with weeks of each other. Essentially, an "Around the World in 80 Days" throwback with a huge cast, some exotic locales to balance the obvious "back-lot and studio" sets, and the improbable premise of a race around the world, the hard way, from New York to Paris without crossing the English Channel or any oceans. My first complaint is that there aren't enough participants. It ends up being only "The Great Lesley" (Curtis) and "Prof. Fate" (Lemmon) who compete in 90% of the race. In "Magnificent Men..." it seems like more of a "true" race with several memorable racing entrants. That aside, it's a great romp for all with a very familiar plot that borrows from everything you have ever seen on film: from Hal Roach Studio's pie throwing classics to "The Prince and the Pauper" (Jack Lemmon in a dual role). Also, it's just too darn long, clocking in at 2:45 in length. Is it funny? It sure is. It's a wonderful opportunity to see Natale Wood, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Ross Martin and several other stars at the height of their careers and (mostly) young. There are too many "cameo" stars in the cast to even try to mention everyone; except to say that Dorothy Provine's saloon song is almost better than the Oscar-winning "Sweetheart Tree." There are several similar movies that I like better, but Natale Wood's performance is "haunting". She looks terrific, but it's not her best role. Tony Curtis (bare chested of course) "swashbuckles" with Ross Martin in a "duel to the death" where no one dies. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk make a great comedy team, but they are not Laurel and Hardy, to be sure. A Saturday afternoon "guilty pleasure" often run on TCM; fully restored and uncut!

    Liked the song. Funny movie. Loved the bridal costume near the end. Loved Leslie's white costuming, and all of Maggie's beautiful outfits. Vivian Vance's costuming was excellent. Dastardly Fate and crown prince both played by great actor Jack Lemmon. Remembering Lemmon and Curtis dressing and acting as women in "Some Like It Hot" (too bad Marilyn wasn't in this picture - The Great Race). Liked this movie in 1965, and still like it. Too bad the principals mainly deceased; not sure about Larry Storch - a friend of Curtis' from long time earlier. Don't think Storch principal here, but definitely a comedic force.

    A solid 8 rating from me. This is a must see to any fan of Edwards or any cast member. Sure it's long and drives off course a few times, but Lemmon and Falk hold it all together, and of course Wood and Curtis are eye candy for guys and gals. The sets are lavish, the kind you rarely see these days. The music by Henry Mancini is perfect, even the sort of stuck on love ballad. They don't make 'em like this anymore and it's just a shame. I have no idea why this movie isn't on more top lists for people. It's just good entertainment.

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).

    Blake Edwards directed this long farce about a professional daredevil(played by Tony Curtis as "The Great Leslie") who decides, in order to promote automobile sales, to stage a New York to Paris road race. He is challenged and relentlessly pursued by arch-rival Professor Fate(played very broadly by Jack Lemmon) and his inept assistant Max(Peter Falk). The beautiful Natalie Wood plays feminist/suffragette Maggie Dubois, who uses her connection to the local newspaper to attach herself to Leslie, much to his consternation. Plot goes on far too long, but even worse, is seldom funny, since it labors for laughs by throwing in everything from a (literally) mustache-twirling villain, to an extended pie-throwing fight, among assorted car crashes and crazy plot developments. Good cast cannot save it.

    Are grand slapstick films like this even made any longer? It seems even the children's comedies nowadays are vulgar and cynical. Not that I'm saying vulgar and cynical can't be entertaining, but it would be nice if there was still room for fare like The Great Race (1965), one of the breeziest comedy spectacles ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that this is a film that will make you feel like a kid again. The plot itself is like a Saturday morning cartoon of old: a daredevil named the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is partaking in an automobile race from New York to Paris, joined by his lackey Hezekiah (Keenan Wynn) and the reporter Miss Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). On the journey, he has to contend with his mustache-twirling rival Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his minion Max (Peter Falk), both willing to do anything to make sure they beat Leslie. The film is episodic, covering their misadventures across the globe. Though It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) is what comes to mind when people think of the short-lived genre of epic comedy, The Great Race is far superior due to focusing on five main characters and running at twenty minutes under three hours. Unlike the earlier film, this one knows when to give you a breather before delivering another volley of gags. The look of the movie itself is easy on the eyes, colorful and warm. The costumes are the stuff of cartoons: Leslie is always in an immaculately white suit and cap, Fate is head to toe in black, and Miss DuBois' outfits (which are wont to change even within the same scene!) come in every color on the rainbow. All the players are great, but the one everyone always remembers is Jack Lemmon's outrageous mustachioed villain, Professor Fate. He leaves much more of an impression then the film's white clad hero, but then again, don't the bad guys usually do? You can tell Lemmon is having the time of his life and consequently, so do we. A perfect film for a rainy day.

    The Great Race has been described as live action cartoon, and that is when it's comedy is at it's most appealing. In the opening minutes Prof fate and Max (Lemmon and Falk)endure cartoonish falls, crashes and explosions, and the comparison to old WB cartoons is apt. Then we get into the plot , and as soon as the racers hit the American west, machinations of the characters take over and the slapstick falters. By the time the story reaches the mythical kingdom of Potsdorf (or something), the plot is dragging the film down badly. It mostly limps home from there. The thing that makes the film watchable is the spectacle, faux early 20th century costuming, stunt work and attention to detail, all of which are outstanding. This is one of the better looking comedies you will ever see, with bright colors everywhere and confident and elaborate staging. It almost doesn't matter that it's not really very funny.

    The Great Race is an epic comedy about an early 20th century car race across three continents. From Blake Edwards (the creator of The Pink Panther series) comes a hysterical motion picture that is bound to have you laughing yourself silly, that film is Edwards' 1965 masterwork, The Great Race. Initially, this movie underperformed because it came out around the time of another classic comedy, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. In my point of view, you can't really compare the two films, except for that they are both hysterical classics that are among the funniest movies of all time. I was expecting a movie with good acting and a lot of funny moments. I got a lot more than that! I ended up getting a hysterical movie with great acting and a lot of outrageous and hilarious moments! When I watched this, I just couldn't stop laughing. Furthermore, this movie proves that Blake Edwards was a comedic genius. Before I saw this movie, I had only seen the first five Pink Panther movies, and while those movies are a lot of fun, The Great Race is a whole ton of more fun! Tony Curtis leads out the cast as The Great Leslie, a man who is competing in a race across three continents. Curtis was wonderful in his role, especially during the climatic Prisoner Of Zenda scenes. Natalie Wood is hilarious as Maggie Dubois, a reporter determined to get a story in the papers. To get this story, she joins the race herself. And of course, I cannot review this film without mentioning Jack Lemmon and his legendary performance as Professor Fate. As much as I enjoyed everybody else in this movie, Lemmon was the best. Professor Fate is the main antagonist, and he represents the stereotypical melodramatic villain, he repeatedly tries to make things bad for The Great Leslie, but most of his plans end up backfiring, resulting in gut-busting hysterical scenes! And then there is Peter Falk as Maximilian Meen, Fate's bumbling right hand man. Everyone in the movie did a fabulous job, but Jack Lemmon did the best. A historical fact: Jack Lemmon's character of Professor Fate was the main inspiration for Dick Dastardly, the villain of the classic cartoon, Wacky Races. Attention all movie fans: those who have not seen The Great Race have definitely got to do so, as there are a gargantuan amount of laughs to be found in the movie! You will split your sides when you see what is considered to be the greatest pie fight in movie history, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing when you see Jack Lemmon in his legendary performance as the flamboyant and villainous Professor Fate. More trivia: this was the second of two movies that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis appeared in together, the first was 1959's Some Like It Hot. What do Some Like It Hot and The Great Race have in common? They are both comedy classics that are among the funniest movies ever made. If you loved Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, then step right up for another race of a lifetime. When you watch The Great Race, you will not be able to stop laughing! I award this movie a perfect rating of ten out of ten for being a legendary movie with countless laughs! Don't miss out on all of the fun! 10/10

    An international road race centres around white-clad goodie The Great Leslie and black-clad baddie Professor Fate. Appearing very soon after the similar Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines (the two films must have been in production at the same time, what a coincidence, eh?), The Great Race is to my mind the more enjoyable movie. Tony Curtis' Leslie has just enough twinkle (in Curtis' performance, as well as animated) to avoid being insufferable, and Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate, clearly the inspiration for Wacky Races' Dick Dastardly, is hysterical (Peter Falk as henchman Maximilian is every bit as funny). Natalie Wood was never more gorgeous. Professor Fate's car is wonderful, the movie is packed full of gags and, as is well known, the film contains the best custard fight sequence of all time - never subsequently equalled - during the Prisoner Of Zenda spoof.

    I still like "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" better, and it's ironic that these 2 films came out with weeks of each other. Essentially, an "Around the World in 80 Days" throwback with a huge cast, some exotic locales to balance the obvious "back-lot and studio" sets, and the improbable premise of a race around the world, the hard way, from New York to Paris without crossing the English Channel or any oceans. My first complaint is that there aren't enough participants. It ends up being only "The Great Lesley" (Curtis) and "Prof. Fate" (Lemmon) who compete in 90% of the race. In "Magnificent Men..." it seems like more of a "true" race with several memorable racing entrants. That aside, it's a great romp for all with a very familiar plot that borrows from everything you have ever seen on film: from Hal Roach Studio's pie throwing classics to "The Prince and the Pauper" (Jack Lemmon in a dual role). Also, it's just too darn long, clocking in at 2:45 in length. Is it funny? It sure is. It's a wonderful opportunity to see Natale Wood, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Ross Martin and several other stars at the height of their careers and (mostly) young. There are too many "cameo" stars in the cast to even try to mention everyone; except to say that Dorothy Provine's saloon song is almost better than the Oscar-winning "Sweetheart Tree." There are several similar movies that I like better, but Natale Wood's performance is "haunting". She looks terrific, but it's not her best role. Tony Curtis (bare chested of course) "swashbuckles" with Ross Martin in a "duel to the death" where no one dies. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk make a great comedy team, but they are not Laurel and Hardy, to be sure. A Saturday afternoon "guilty pleasure" often run on TCM; fully restored and uncut!

    Liked the song. Funny movie. Loved the bridal costume near the end. Loved Leslie's white costuming, and all of Maggie's beautiful outfits. Vivian Vance's costuming was excellent. Dastardly Fate and crown prince both played by great actor Jack Lemmon. Remembering Lemmon and Curtis dressing and acting as women in "Some Like It Hot" (too bad Marilyn wasn't in this picture - The Great Race). Liked this movie in 1965, and still like it. Too bad the principals mainly deceased; not sure about Larry Storch - a friend of Curtis' from long time earlier. Don't think Storch principal here, but definitely a comedic force.

    A solid 8 rating from me. This is a must see to any fan of Edwards or any cast member. Sure it's long and drives off course a few times, but Lemmon and Falk hold it all together, and of course Wood and Curtis are eye candy for guys and gals. The sets are lavish, the kind you rarely see these days. The music by Henry Mancini is perfect, even the sort of stuck on love ballad. They don't make 'em like this anymore and it's just a shame. I have no idea why this movie isn't on more top lists for people. It's just good entertainment.

    In 1908, dastardly black-clad Jack Lemmon (as "Professor Fate") and terrific white-clad Tony Curtis (as "The Great Leslie") go on an automobile race from New York City to Paris. Joining them for most of the journey are Natalie Wood (as Maggie Dubois) and Peter Falk (as Max). If you're new to these names, Curtis gets Wood and Lemmon gets Falk. Before finishing the race, Mr. Lemmon assumes a dual role and the movie spoofs "The Prisoner of Zenda". This film is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy, who you can sample in "The Music Box" during this film's interludes (without missing much). In comedy, timing is essential; this film's excessive scope does not compliment the material. The catchy "Sweetheart Tree" theme was a minor hit for composer Henry Mancini. **** The Great Race (7/1/65) Blake Edwards ~ Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk

    A box office success in it's day, The Great Race is brassy and long-winded, nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes long. And though it centers around a a car race, the film drags because the race lacks excitement, and the characters are annoying. You don't care who wins. The only thing you'll root for is for the race to finish. Natalie Wood is lovely though embarrassing as she and Tony Curtis shout at each other while Lemon plays a one-note, dastardly villain as written. Some of the nostalgic trimmings are nice, but I prefer It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(63)which also featured Dorothy Provine because at least it had momentum. Blake Edwards directed without the charm or inventiveness he displayed in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Victor/Victoria. A live-action cartoon, The Great Race can't sustain its elaboration and length. The 3 leads have demonstrated comic ability elsewhere: Lemon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot(59) and Natalie Wood in Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice(69).
