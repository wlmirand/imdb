    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific. 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention. Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific. 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention. Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!

It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific. 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention. Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific. 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention. Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!

Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job. The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.

    The best thing that I can say about Sex, Lies and videotape is that the film lives up to the potential of its name. I remember watching trashes having spurring names. In a way it has some significant similarities with a later masterpiece, American Beauty, and in some ways Sex, Lies and videotape is even better than American Beauty. It has an amazing economy, brilliant script, wonderful performances from all the four major actors and superb cinematography. It has got almost everything that is wonderful about filmmaking. John, a clever lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his wife's sister, Cynthia. His wife, Ann, is absolutely uninterested in sex and seems more concerned about waste management. She confesses to her therapist that she hardly has sex these days. But interestingly she is happy with her life, feels secured and comfortable with her husband; at least she is able to successfully pretend. Probably she doesn't even know whether she really love her husband or not. She is shy to talk about sex and feels it's not that important, at least this she wants to believe. Ann somehow also believes that even if she has no interest in having sex with her husband still he would not go to another woman. She tells John that it will absolutely break her down if she comes to know about something like that. On the other hand, John and Cynthia are having frequent and electrifying times in bed, something that Ann has no clue about. Cynthia is hot, seductive and according to Ann, loud and extrovert. She kind of finds having sex on her sister's bed a rousing proposition. Interestingly, john has a strong sense of possession about his wife and does not want to break his marriage, for whatever reasons. In this already exciting scenario enters an even interesting pal, Graham, a friend of John, whom he hasn't seen for nine years. Graham is more interested in sex as a subject, than as a practice. He discusses sex with women he meets, about their experiences, desires, fantasies, and records those interviews in his camcorder, with their permission of course. It seems to be his favorite pastime. Now imagine a situation with all four of them having the chance to meet and talk to each other. Though the film has some clich&eacute;s like Ann, while visiting her sister's house, unknowingly taking a look at the small tree gifted to Cynthia by John, when last time he went there to have sex or Ann's lovely photograph at John's office table, shown at a predictable juncture of his conversation with Cynthia. During an exchange at a restaurant with Ann, Graham says that he read it somewhere that, a man loves the woman he is attracted to and a woman gets attracted to a man she loves. Well, this has some value in terms of this film at least. After all Ann is not proved to be that uninterested in sex, and even if it kind of hurts John to hear Cynthia telling him that she doesn't trust him, he has to somehow swallow it.

    It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister. Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments ("Schizopolis", anyone?) and this is one of his best.

    I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).

    This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's "A Steetcar Named Desire." Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires. The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's. As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired. In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.

    We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one. The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong. A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation. What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.

    The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling. An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity. The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is "She's actually telling me this stuff!" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind. The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.

    'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific. 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention. Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!

    Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances. sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is. The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most "serious" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape. Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship. It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up. sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.

    I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film. On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ... (I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood. Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role). And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words "sex, lies and videotape" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been. Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men). There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does. That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

    Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work. Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own).

The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch.
