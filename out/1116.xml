    In the early 19th century, handsome swordsman Tyrone Power (as Diego Vega) travels from Madrid, Spain to Los Angeles, California. He learns, from sinister swordsman Basil Rathbone (as Esteban Pasquale), that scene-stealing J. Edward Bromberg (as Luis Quintero) and his cronies have taken command of the land. Clearly signaling their desire to lock horns, Mr. Power and Mr. Rathbone make a notable first impression. Power responds to tyrannical rule by becoming a Spanish-styled "Robin Hood". In black cape and mask, Power (as "Zorro") fights injustice, leaving a telltale sword-swiped "Z" as his calling card... Stylish direction by Rouben Mamoulian, and the 20th Century-Fox production team, helped this "Zorro" leave a mark. Power is fine as the avenger. Most of his antics are accomplished by the "Z" special effect and a stunt double on horseback. Surprisingly, Power's real performance is as Zorro's mild-mannered - actually, fey - alter ego. With a final fencing duel against Rathbone, Power nails both the performance and picture. Adding to the above are good roles for Gale Sondergaard (as Inez Quintero) and Eugene Palette (as Fray Felipe). Newcomer Linda Darnell (as Lolita Quintero) is a beautiful romantic interest. ******** The Mark of Zorro (11/1/40) Rouben Mamoulian ~ Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, J. Edward Bromberg, Linda Darnell

    I am a Zorro freak! I have watched all the old serial editions and one of my very favorite books is Isabelle Allende's Zorro, which takes place in Spain before he comes to California. Forget the Antonio Banderas versions. There is nothing that can match Tyrone Power's Mark of Zorro. He is Zorro. He plays the perfect fop - almost a gay caricature - discussing fabrics and dancing with the wife of the evil Alcante. But, in his double life, he is the Saviour of the people and fights to restore his father to the position. The duel at the end with Capitan Estaban (Basil Rathbone) is some of the best swordplay you will ever see. (In another life, I was a great fencing master). The musical score by Alfred Newman, well, it's Alfred Newman, and he is one of the very best. If you want to see how Zorro should be really played, you have to see Tyrone Power. That's just the way it is.

    One thing this movie has is impressive horse riding chase scenes that make you grin at the ingenuity of the director and the cinematographer. The films pace is so exciting that you know that you just have to dip your hat to how it was captured on celluloid. Basil Rathbone (who is famous for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Rathbone/Bruce series that contained 14 movies between the years of 1939  1946) is a famous Hollywood swordsman, and I also read that Tyrone Power was also good with sword, and so I eagerly waited for the duel scene between the two. When the duel started, the idea that this was actually both the actors willing the swords and not just mere stunt men also added to the fun, as the duel is just wonderful and masterful, the grace and the speed the two masterful swordsmen displayed on screen is one that I will always remember, and one that I ask others to see, because I have not seen better fencing than that as of now. The movie had scenes that jumped at you, there was another chase scene where Zorro (Tyrone Power) made his horse jump off a bridge into a stream and made the horse ride/swam to shore, it was such a sight I raised my brow in amazement, wondering how many shots the director had to take to get that scene right. The Mark of Zorro is fun, although you can pick out plot holes and wonder how the hero was planning to achieve anything in the riot like ending, but the movie was fun to see all the way through, the story arc is taken from the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley in 1919, the book introduced the masked hero Zorro, who was like Robin Hood in most sense. Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor. The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination. The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone. www.lagsreviews.com

    Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else. Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace. Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone. As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures. My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

    "The Mark of Zorro" was clearly 20 Century Fox's answer to the spectacular success of Warner Brothers' "The Adventures of Robin Hood". Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro. Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of "The Letter", in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue! A movie like the "The Mark of Zorro" wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

    The only ingredient missing here is a Fox budget that would have provided Technicolor photography as a part of the film's lush production values. However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast. Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of "the girl" goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself. In the chapel scene and "The White Sombrero" dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest. Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship. Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent. By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

    This is what I can't help but like about the old high seas adventures and swashbuckling romances of the 1930s and '40s. You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, "Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing" So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

    After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian "Robin Hood" had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters: goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details. While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ... ...with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting. Highly recommended movie! 10/10

    This movie I saw one day a very long time ago when my mother brought it home for us to watch, I was really interested into seeing it so I happily sat back to watch this movie. And of course, I had to say what I thought of this movie, well here is what I thought of it, I thought that this film was remarkable, and not only that, but Tyrone Power is excellent! This film is really filled with a lot of really cool action scenes and a lot of thrills, and that is what I really love about a lot of movies such as this one, action and thrills, and this movie really had a lot of that, or better, this movie just plain had a lot of really great everything! I remember that I was cheering a lot with excitement when I first saw this movie, and I was also really filled with a lot of suspense and anticipation over what was going to happen next as the film went on. Anyway, this film was very phenomenal, it is a very great movie that you are going to enjoy! Now it is time for my to talk about the main actor, Tyrone Power. I thought that he was totally fabulous for the role of Zorro, he could be both very sinister, and also have a lot of appeal and charm! Here is a little tip for people who are playing villains in a movie, if you want to make your villain a really great villain, then add some charm and charisma, because it will only make whatever villain that you are playing more likable! There are villains that you just plain love and villains that you don't feel sorry for at all! Here is a little something that I am going to tell you that I think that you are going to understand, you really gotta see this movie, because you are totally going to like it, you are going to think that this movie is really a spectacularly good time, so please, listen to me and see this! 10/10

    You know the story. You've heard the legend. Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur. Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor. This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro. Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of "The Letter", in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue! A movie like the "The Mark of Zorro" wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

    The only ingredient missing here is a Fox budget that would have provided Technicolor photography as a part of the film's lush production values. However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast. Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of "the girl" goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself. In the chapel scene and "The White Sombrero" dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest. Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship. Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent. By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

    This is what I can't help but like about the old high seas adventures and swashbuckling romances of the 1930s and '40s. You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, "Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing" So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

    After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian "Robin Hood" had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters: goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details. While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ... ...with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting. Highly recommended movie! 10/10

    You know the story. You've heard the legend. Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur. Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor. This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

    In the early 19th century, handsome swordsman Tyrone Power (as Diego Vega) travels from Madrid, Spain to Los Angeles, California. He learns, from sinister swordsman Basil Rathbone (as Esteban Pasquale), that scene-stealing J. Edward Bromberg (as Luis Quintero) and his cronies have taken command of the land. Clearly signaling their desire to lock horns, Mr. Power and Mr. Rathbone make a notable first impression. Power responds to tyrannical rule by becoming a Spanish-styled "Robin Hood". In black cape and mask, Power (as "Zorro") fights injustice, leaving a telltale sword-swiped "Z" as his calling card... Stylish direction by Rouben Mamoulian, and the 20th Century-Fox production team, helped this "Zorro" leave a mark. Power is fine as the avenger. Most of his antics are accomplished by the "Z" special effect and a stunt double on horseback. Surprisingly, Power's real performance is as Zorro's mild-mannered - actually, fey - alter ego. With a final fencing duel against Rathbone, Power nails both the performance and picture. Adding to the above are good roles for Gale Sondergaard (as Inez Quintero) and Eugene Palette (as Fray Felipe). Newcomer Linda Darnell (as Lolita Quintero) is a beautiful romantic interest. ******** The Mark of Zorro (11/1/40) Rouben Mamoulian ~ Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, J. Edward Bromberg, Linda Darnell

    I am a Zorro freak! I have watched all the old serial editions and one of my very favorite books is Isabelle Allende's Zorro, which takes place in Spain before he comes to California. Forget the Antonio Banderas versions. There is nothing that can match Tyrone Power's Mark of Zorro. He is Zorro. He plays the perfect fop - almost a gay caricature - discussing fabrics and dancing with the wife of the evil Alcante. But, in his double life, he is the Saviour of the people and fights to restore his father to the position. The duel at the end with Capitan Estaban (Basil Rathbone) is some of the best swordplay you will ever see. (In another life, I was a great fencing master). The musical score by Alfred Newman, well, it's Alfred Newman, and he is one of the very best. If you want to see how Zorro should be really played, you have to see Tyrone Power. That's just the way it is.

    One thing this movie has is impressive horse riding chase scenes that make you grin at the ingenuity of the director and the cinematographer. The films pace is so exciting that you know that you just have to dip your hat to how it was captured on celluloid. Basil Rathbone (who is famous for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Rathbone/Bruce series that contained 14 movies between the years of 1939  1946) is a famous Hollywood swordsman, and I also read that Tyrone Power was also good with sword, and so I eagerly waited for the duel scene between the two. When the duel started, the idea that this was actually both the actors willing the swords and not just mere stunt men also added to the fun, as the duel is just wonderful and masterful, the grace and the speed the two masterful swordsmen displayed on screen is one that I will always remember, and one that I ask others to see, because I have not seen better fencing than that as of now. The movie had scenes that jumped at you, there was another chase scene where Zorro (Tyrone Power) made his horse jump off a bridge into a stream and made the horse ride/swam to shore, it was such a sight I raised my brow in amazement, wondering how many shots the director had to take to get that scene right. The Mark of Zorro is fun, although you can pick out plot holes and wonder how the hero was planning to achieve anything in the riot like ending, but the movie was fun to see all the way through, the story arc is taken from the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley in 1919, the book introduced the masked hero Zorro, who was like Robin Hood in most sense. Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor. The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination. The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone. www.lagsreviews.com

    Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else. Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace. Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone. As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures. My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting. Highly recommended movie! 10/10

    This movie I saw one day a very long time ago when my mother brought it home for us to watch, I was really interested into seeing it so I happily sat back to watch this movie. And of course, I had to say what I thought of this movie, well here is what I thought of it, I thought that this film was remarkable, and not only that, but Tyrone Power is excellent! This film is really filled with a lot of really cool action scenes and a lot of thrills, and that is what I really love about a lot of movies such as this one, action and thrills, and this movie really had a lot of that, or better, this movie just plain had a lot of really great everything! I remember that I was cheering a lot with excitement when I first saw this movie, and I was also really filled with a lot of suspense and anticipation over what was going to happen next as the film went on. Anyway, this film was very phenomenal, it is a very great movie that you are going to enjoy! Now it is time for my to talk about the main actor, Tyrone Power. I thought that he was totally fabulous for the role of Zorro, he could be both very sinister, and also have a lot of appeal and charm! Here is a little tip for people who are playing villains in a movie, if you want to make your villain a really great villain, then add some charm and charisma, because it will only make whatever villain that you are playing more likable! There are villains that you just plain love and villains that you don't feel sorry for at all! Here is a little something that I am going to tell you that I think that you are going to understand, you really gotta see this movie, because you are totally going to like it, you are going to think that this movie is really a spectacularly good time, so please, listen to me and see this! 10/10

    You know the story. You've heard the legend. Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur. Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor. This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

    In the early 19th century, handsome swordsman Tyrone Power (as Diego Vega) travels from Madrid, Spain to Los Angeles, California. He learns, from sinister swordsman Basil Rathbone (as Esteban Pasquale), that scene-stealing J. Edward Bromberg (as Luis Quintero) and his cronies have taken command of the land. Clearly signaling their desire to lock horns, Mr. Power and Mr. Rathbone make a notable first impression. Power responds to tyrannical rule by becoming a Spanish-styled "Robin Hood". In black cape and mask, Power (as "Zorro") fights injustice, leaving a telltale sword-swiped "Z" as his calling card... Stylish direction by Rouben Mamoulian, and the 20th Century-Fox production team, helped this "Zorro" leave a mark. Power is fine as the avenger. Most of his antics are accomplished by the "Z" special effect and a stunt double on horseback. Surprisingly, Power's real performance is as Zorro's mild-mannered - actually, fey - alter ego. With a final fencing duel against Rathbone, Power nails both the performance and picture. Adding to the above are good roles for Gale Sondergaard (as Inez Quintero) and Eugene Palette (as Fray Felipe). Newcomer Linda Darnell (as Lolita Quintero) is a beautiful romantic interest. ******** The Mark of Zorro (11/1/40) Rouben Mamoulian ~ Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, J. Edward Bromberg, Linda Darnell

    I am a Zorro freak! I have watched all the old serial editions and one of my very favorite books is Isabelle Allende's Zorro, which takes place in Spain before he comes to California. Forget the Antonio Banderas versions. There is nothing that can match Tyrone Power's Mark of Zorro. He is Zorro. He plays the perfect fop - almost a gay caricature - discussing fabrics and dancing with the wife of the evil Alcante. But, in his double life, he is the Saviour of the people and fights to restore his father to the position. The duel at the end with Capitan Estaban (Basil Rathbone) is some of the best swordplay you will ever see. (In another life, I was a great fencing master). The musical score by Alfred Newman, well, it's Alfred Newman, and he is one of the very best. If you want to see how Zorro should be really played, you have to see Tyrone Power. That's just the way it is.

    One thing this movie has is impressive horse riding chase scenes that make you grin at the ingenuity of the director and the cinematographer. The films pace is so exciting that you know that you just have to dip your hat to how it was captured on celluloid. Basil Rathbone (who is famous for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Rathbone/Bruce series that contained 14 movies between the years of 1939  1946) is a famous Hollywood swordsman, and I also read that Tyrone Power was also good with sword, and so I eagerly waited for the duel scene between the two. When the duel started, the idea that this was actually both the actors willing the swords and not just mere stunt men also added to the fun, as the duel is just wonderful and masterful, the grace and the speed the two masterful swordsmen displayed on screen is one that I will always remember, and one that I ask others to see, because I have not seen better fencing than that as of now. The movie had scenes that jumped at you, there was another chase scene where Zorro (Tyrone Power) made his horse jump off a bridge into a stream and made the horse ride/swam to shore, it was such a sight I raised my brow in amazement, wondering how many shots the director had to take to get that scene right. The Mark of Zorro is fun, although you can pick out plot holes and wonder how the hero was planning to achieve anything in the riot like ending, but the movie was fun to see all the way through, the story arc is taken from the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley in 1919, the book introduced the masked hero Zorro, who was like Robin Hood in most sense. Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor. The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination. The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone. www.lagsreviews.com

    Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else. Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace. Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone. As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures. My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

    "The Mark of Zorro" was clearly 20 Century Fox's answer to the spectacular success of Warner Brothers' "The Adventures of Robin Hood". Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro. Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of "The Letter", in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue! A movie like the "The Mark of Zorro" wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

    The only ingredient missing here is a Fox budget that would have provided Technicolor photography as a part of the film's lush production values. However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast. Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of "the girl" goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself. In the chapel scene and "The White Sombrero" dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest. Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship. Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent. By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

    This is what I can't help but like about the old high seas adventures and swashbuckling romances of the 1930s and '40s. You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, "Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing" So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

    After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian "Robin Hood" had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters: goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details. While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ... ...with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting.

    One thing this movie has is impressive horse riding chase scenes that make you grin at the ingenuity of the director and the cinematographer. The films pace is so exciting that you know that you just have to dip your hat to how it was captured on celluloid. Basil Rathbone (who is famous for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Rathbone/Bruce series that contained 14 movies between the years of 1939  1946) is a famous Hollywood swordsman, and I also read that Tyrone Power was also good with sword, and so I eagerly waited for the duel scene between the two. When the duel started, the idea that this was actually both the actors willing the swords and not just mere stunt men also added to the fun, as the duel is just wonderful and masterful, the grace and the speed the two masterful swordsmen displayed on screen is one that I will always remember, and one that I ask others to see, because I have not seen better fencing than that as of now. The movie had scenes that jumped at you, there was another chase scene where Zorro (Tyrone Power) made his horse jump off a bridge into a stream and made the horse ride/swam to shore, it was such a sight I raised my brow in amazement, wondering how many shots the director had to take to get that scene right. The Mark of Zorro is fun, although you can pick out plot holes and wonder how the hero was planning to achieve anything in the riot like ending, but the movie was fun to see all the way through, the story arc is taken from the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley in 1919, the book introduced the masked hero Zorro, who was like Robin Hood in most sense. Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor. The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination. The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone. www.lagsreviews.com

    Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else. Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace. Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone. As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures. My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

    "The Mark of Zorro" was clearly 20 Century Fox's answer to the spectacular success of Warner Brothers' "The Adventures of Robin Hood". Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro. Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of "The Letter", in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue! A movie like the "The Mark of Zorro" wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

    The only ingredient missing here is a Fox budget that would have provided Technicolor photography as a part of the film's lush production values. However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast. Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of "the girl" goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself. In the chapel scene and "The White Sombrero" dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest. Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship. Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent. By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

    This is what I can't help but like about the old high seas adventures and swashbuckling romances of the 1930s and '40s. You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, "Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing" So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

    After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian "Robin Hood" had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters: goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details. While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ... ...with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting. Highly recommended movie! 10/10

    This movie I saw one day a very long time ago when my mother brought it home for us to watch, I was really interested into seeing it so I happily sat back to watch this movie. And of course, I had to say what I thought of this movie, well here is what I thought of it, I thought that this film was remarkable, and not only that, but Tyrone Power is excellent! This film is really filled with a lot of really cool action scenes and a lot of thrills, and that is what I really love about a lot of movies such as this one, action and thrills, and this movie really had a lot of that, or better, this movie just plain had a lot of really great everything! I remember that I was cheering a lot with excitement when I first saw this movie, and I was also really filled with a lot of suspense and anticipation over what was going to happen next as the film went on. Anyway, this film was very phenomenal, it is a very great movie that you are going to enjoy! Now it is time for my to talk about the main actor, Tyrone Power. I thought that he was totally fabulous for the role of Zorro, he could be both very sinister, and also have a lot of appeal and charm! Here is a little tip for people who are playing villains in a movie, if you want to make your villain a really great villain, then add some charm and charisma, because it will only make whatever villain that you are playing more likable! There are villains that you just plain love and villains that you don't feel sorry for at all! Here is a little something that I am going to tell you that I think that you are going to understand, you really gotta see this movie, because you are totally going to like it, you are going to think that this movie is really a spectacularly good time, so please, listen to me and see this! 10/10

    You know the story. You've heard the legend. Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur. Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor. This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

    In the early 19th century, handsome swordsman Tyrone Power (as Diego Vega) travels from Madrid, Spain to Los Angeles, California. He learns, from sinister swordsman Basil Rathbone (as Esteban Pasquale), that scene-stealing J. Edward Bromberg (as Luis Quintero) and his cronies have taken command of the land. Clearly signaling their desire to lock horns, Mr. Power and Mr. Rathbone make a notable first impression. Power responds to tyrannical rule by becoming a Spanish-styled "Robin Hood". In black cape and mask, Power (as "Zorro") fights injustice, leaving a telltale sword-swiped "Z" as his calling card... Stylish direction by Rouben Mamoulian, and the 20th Century-Fox production team, helped this "Zorro" leave a mark. Power is fine as the avenger. Most of his antics are accomplished by the "Z" special effect and a stunt double on horseback. Surprisingly, Power's real performance is as Zorro's mild-mannered - actually, fey - alter ego. With a final fencing duel against Rathbone, Power nails both the performance and picture. Adding to the above are good roles for Gale Sondergaard (as Inez Quintero) and Eugene Palette (as Fray Felipe). Newcomer Linda Darnell (as Lolita Quintero) is a beautiful romantic interest. ******** The Mark of Zorro (11/1/40) Rouben Mamoulian ~ Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, J. Edward Bromberg, Linda Darnell

    I am a Zorro freak! I have watched all the old serial editions and one of my very favorite books is Isabelle Allende's Zorro, which takes place in Spain before he comes to California. Forget the Antonio Banderas versions. There is nothing that can match Tyrone Power's Mark of Zorro. He is Zorro. He plays the perfect fop - almost a gay caricature - discussing fabrics and dancing with the wife of the evil Alcante. But, in his double life, he is the Saviour of the people and fights to restore his father to the position. The duel at the end with Capitan Estaban (Basil Rathbone) is some of the best swordplay you will ever see. (In another life, I was a great fencing master). The musical score by Alfred Newman, well, it's Alfred Newman, and he is one of the very best. If you want to see how Zorro should be really played, you have to see Tyrone Power. That's just the way it is.

I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

    After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian "Robin Hood" had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters: goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details. While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ... ...with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government. ...with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact: she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes: the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow... ...with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather... ...against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate. ...with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting. Highly recommended movie! 10/10

    This movie I saw one day a very long time ago when my mother brought it home for us to watch, I was really interested into seeing it so I happily sat back to watch this movie. And of course, I had to say what I thought of this movie, well here is what I thought of it, I thought that this film was remarkable, and not only that, but Tyrone Power is excellent! This film is really filled with a lot of really cool action scenes and a lot of thrills, and that is what I really love about a lot of movies such as this one, action and thrills, and this movie really had a lot of that, or better, this movie just plain had a lot of really great everything! I remember that I was cheering a lot with excitement when I first saw this movie, and I was also really filled with a lot of suspense and anticipation over what was going to happen next as the film went on. Anyway, this film was very phenomenal, it is a very great movie that you are going to enjoy! Now it is time for my to talk about the main actor, Tyrone Power. I thought that he was totally fabulous for the role of Zorro, he could be both very sinister, and also have a lot of appeal and charm! Here is a little tip for people who are playing villains in a movie, if you want to make your villain a really great villain, then add some charm and charisma, because it will only make whatever villain that you are playing more likable! There are villains that you just plain love and villains that you don't feel sorry for at all! Here is a little something that I am going to tell you that I think that you are going to understand, you really gotta see this movie, because you are totally going to like it, you are going to think that this movie is really a spectacularly good time, so please, listen to me and see this! 10/10

    You know the story. You've heard the legend. Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur. Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor. This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

    In the early 19th century, handsome swordsman Tyrone Power (as Diego Vega) travels from Madrid, Spain to Los Angeles, California. He learns, from sinister swordsman Basil Rathbone (as Esteban Pasquale), that scene-stealing J. Edward Bromberg (as Luis Quintero) and his cronies have taken command of the land. Clearly signaling their desire to lock horns, Mr. Power and Mr. Rathbone make a notable first impression. Power responds to tyrannical rule by becoming a Spanish-styled "Robin Hood". In black cape and mask, Power (as "Zorro") fights injustice, leaving a telltale sword-swiped "Z" as his calling card... Stylish direction by Rouben Mamoulian, and the 20th Century-Fox production team, helped this "Zorro" leave a mark. Power is fine as the avenger. Most of his antics are accomplished by the "Z" special effect and a stunt double on horseback. Surprisingly, Power's real performance is as Zorro's mild-mannered - actually, fey - alter ego. With a final fencing duel against Rathbone, Power nails both the performance and picture. Adding to the above are good roles for Gale Sondergaard (as Inez Quintero) and Eugene Palette (as Fray Felipe). Newcomer Linda Darnell (as Lolita Quintero) is a beautiful romantic interest. ******** The Mark of Zorro (11/1/40) Rouben Mamoulian ~ Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, J. Edward Bromberg, Linda Darnell

    I am a Zorro freak! I have watched all the old serial editions and one of my very favorite books is Isabelle Allende's Zorro, which takes place in Spain before he comes to California. Forget the Antonio Banderas versions. There is nothing that can match Tyrone Power's Mark of Zorro. He is Zorro. He plays the perfect fop - almost a gay caricature - discussing fabrics and dancing with the wife of the evil Alcante. But, in his double life, he is the Saviour of the people and fights to restore his father to the position. The duel at the end with Capitan Estaban (Basil Rathbone) is some of the best swordplay you will ever see. (In another life, I was a great fencing master). The musical score by Alfred Newman, well, it's Alfred Newman, and he is one of the very best. If you want to see how Zorro should be really played, you have to see Tyrone Power. That's just the way it is.

    One thing this movie has is impressive horse riding chase scenes that make you grin at the ingenuity of the director and the cinematographer. The films pace is so exciting that you know that you just have to dip your hat to how it was captured on celluloid. Basil Rathbone (who is famous for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Rathbone/Bruce series that contained 14 movies between the years of 1939  1946) is a famous Hollywood swordsman, and I also read that Tyrone Power was also good with sword, and so I eagerly waited for the duel scene between the two. When the duel started, the idea that this was actually both the actors willing the swords and not just mere stunt men also added to the fun, as the duel is just wonderful and masterful, the grace and the speed the two masterful swordsmen displayed on screen is one that I will always remember, and one that I ask others to see, because I have not seen better fencing than that as of now. The movie had scenes that jumped at you, there was another chase scene where Zorro (Tyrone Power) made his horse jump off a bridge into a stream and made the horse ride/swam to shore, it was such a sight I raised my brow in amazement, wondering how many shots the director had to take to get that scene right. The Mark of Zorro is fun, although you can pick out plot holes and wonder how the hero was planning to achieve anything in the riot like ending, but the movie was fun to see all the way through, the story arc is taken from the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley in 1919, the book introduced the masked hero Zorro, who was like Robin Hood in most sense. Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor. The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination. The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone. www.lagsreviews.com

    Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else. Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace. Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone. As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures. My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

    "The Mark of Zorro" was clearly 20 Century Fox's answer to the spectacular success of Warner Brothers' "The Adventures of Robin Hood". Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro. Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of "The Letter", in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue! A movie like the "The Mark of Zorro" wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

    The only ingredient missing here is a Fox budget that would have provided Technicolor photography as a part of the film's lush production values. However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast. Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of "the girl" goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself. In the chapel scene and "The White Sombrero" dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest. Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship. Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent. By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

    This is what I can't help but like about the old high seas adventures and swashbuckling romances of the 1930s and '40s. You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, "Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing" So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies. When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude. The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matin&eacute;e idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later. The nuts and bolts are all here: Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as "alcalde" has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy: Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way.

This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example: Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro. Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, "This is outrageous." Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!
